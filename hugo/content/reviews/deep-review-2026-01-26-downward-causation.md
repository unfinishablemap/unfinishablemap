title: Deep Review - Downward Causation
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-01-26
**Article**: [Downward Causation](/concepts/downward-causation/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-20](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-20-downward-causation/)
**Cross-review context**: psychophysical-laws-framework.md

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The previous review (2026-01-20) comprehensively addressed the major gaps:
- Added falsifiability section
- Added Many-Worlds section
- Added decoherence challenge
- Added illusionist challenge
- Added process philosophy alternative
- Added attention-as-interface connection

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Missing cross-link to psychophysical-laws-framework**: The new framework introduces "selection laws" terminology and evaluates multiple coupling mechanisms.
   - **Resolution**: Added cross-link in opening paragraph introducing selection laws terminology; added to Further Reading section; added [psychophysical-laws](/concepts/psychophysical-laws/) to concepts frontmatter.

2. **Over-reliance on Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism**: Writing style guide warns against hanging articles on speculative mechanisms.
   - **Resolution**: Revised to acknowledge multiple proposed mechanisms (Stapp, Eccles, valence coupling) with reference to framework for detailed evaluation.

3. **Decoherence response could be strengthened**: The bandwidth constraint (~10 bits/second) from the framework is relevant.
   - **Resolution**: Replaced quantum Zeno sidestep argument with bandwidth constraint argument—consciousness operates at policy level, not individual quantum events.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Eliminativist response**: Folk psychological categories may be confused. Addressed via self-stultification argument (previous review).
- **Physicist consensus on decoherence**: Tegmark's calculations remain mainstream. Noted but balanced with biological quantum effects evidence.
- **Buddhist non-dual critique**: Both "mental" and "physical" may be conventional. Acknowledged as outside article scope.

All six adversarial personas engaged. No new critical issues identified; previous review had achieved good stability.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Clear, fair presentation of Kim's exclusion argument
- Excellent weak/strong downward causation distinction
- Well-structured comparison table (quantum interactionism vs classical emergentism)
- Strong "Relation to Site Perspective" section connecting all five tenets
- Comprehensive falsifiability section
- Self-stultification argument against epiphenomenalism
- Process philosophy as complementary framework

### Enhancements Made

1. Added selection laws terminology and link to psychophysical-laws-framework in opening paragraph
2. Revised quantum mechanism section to acknowledge multiple proposals (Stapp, Eccles, valence)
3. Replaced quantum Zeno decoherence response with bandwidth constraint argument
4. Added [psychophysical-laws-framework](/topics/psychophysical-laws-bridging-mind-and-matter/) to Further Reading
5. Added [psychophysical-laws](/concepts/psychophysical-laws/) to concepts frontmatter
6. Tightened prose in Kim's argument section and overdetermination section for length neutrality

### Cross-links Added

- [psychophysical-laws-framework](/topics/psychophysical-laws-bridging-mind-and-matter/) — The comprehensive framework for specifying mind-matter laws
- [psychophysical-laws](/concepts/psychophysical-laws/) — Added to concepts frontmatter

## Length Analysis

- **Before**: 3208 words (128% of 2500 soft threshold)
- **After**: ~3200 words (approximately length-neutral)
- **Mode**: Length-neutral (additions balanced with prose tightening)

## Remaining Items

None. Article has reached stability through two review cycles.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed twice (2026-01-20, 2026-01-26). The first review addressed major structural gaps. This second review focused on cross-integration with the new psychophysical-laws-framework content.

**Philosophical disagreements that should NOT be re-flagged as critical:**
- Eliminativists will reject the folk psychological framing—this is a bedrock disagreement
- Physicists accepting Tegmark's decoherence calculations will find quantum mechanisms unconvincing—the article presents both sides
- MWI proponents will find the single-world requirement unsatisfying—this is acknowledged as a tenet dependency

**The article has converged.** Future reviews should focus on:
- New external content requiring integration (as this one did)
- Factual errors or broken links
- Changes to the Map's tenets that affect the argument

Standard deep-review cycles should skip this article unless significant modifications occur.
