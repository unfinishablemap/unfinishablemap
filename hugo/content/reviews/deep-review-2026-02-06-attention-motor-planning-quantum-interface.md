title: Deep Review - The Attention-Motor Quantum Interface

**Date**: 2026-02-06
**Article**: [The Attention-Motor Quantum Interface](/archive/topics/attention-motor-planning-quantum-interface/)
**Previous review**: Never (note: [2026-01-26](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-26-attention-motor-quantum-interface/) reviewed the concept-level file, not this topic)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Six adversarial personas (Eliminative Materialist, Hard-Nosed Physicalist, Quantum Skeptic, Many-Worlds Defender, Empiricist, Buddhist Philosopher) applied critical scrutiny.

### Critical Issues Found

- **Bengson et al. 2019 misattribution**: Reference list cited "Bengson, J.J., Mangun, G.R., & Mazaheri, A." but the actual first author is Rajan. In-text citations said "Bengson et al." when Bengson is fourth of six authors. **Resolution**: Corrected all in-text citations to "Rajan et al. 2019" and fixed reference list to show correct author order.

- **Sjöberg (2024) nuance dropped**: Article claimed SMA resection patients "retain their sense of voluntary action" without noting they lose the ability to execute voluntary movements (SMA syndrome). This omission made the evidence appear to support the article's case more cleanly than it does. **Resolution**: Expanded to include both findings — patients retain subjective sense of willing but lose voluntary execution capacity. Reframed interpretation accordingly.

- **300ms timing claim misleading**: Article presented "willed attention deploys in approximately 300ms" to parallel the 280ms motor commitment figure. The actual data shows 300ms is closer to an early ERP component, with the full deployment process spanning ~250-1200ms. **Resolution**: Changed to "250-350ms" range for the early willed attention component, noted the full deployment extends over a longer window, and reframed as "overlap of early commitment signals" rather than precise timing match.

### Medium Issues Found

- **PMTA presented as established fact**: "Finds that" implied settled science; the strong form is debated (Smith & Schenk 2012). **Resolution**: Changed "finds" to "proposes" and added note that the strong form remains debated while shared circuitry evidence is robust.

- **Kaeser citation**: First authors are Cai and Liu, not Kaeser (senior author). **Resolution**: Corrected to "Cai et al. 2024" in text and reference list.

- **Phasic/tonic terminology imposed**: The 2024 Nature study uses "action-potential-induced dopamine release" and "dopamine dynamics," not phasic/tonic. **Resolution**: Reworded to use the paper's own terminology.

- **10 bits/second figure uncited**: No reference provided for this specific bandwidth claim. **Resolution**: Changed to "narrow bandwidth" without specific figure.

- **Quantum Zeno overemphasis**: Per writing style guide, QZE should illustrate possibilities, not dominate narrative. **Resolution**: Reframed QZE as "one candidate mechanism" in Selection Architecture section and made effort section argument independent of specific mechanism. Core argument now survives if QZE is disproven.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Eliminative Materialist** (Churchland): Neural competition sufficiency — article's argument that "something beyond neural dynamics must contribute" is asserted rather than demonstrated. Deferred: the article's philosophical reasoning stands as the Map's position; fuller engagement would require significant expansion.
- **Hard-Nosed Physicalist** (Dennett): Heterophenomenology not addressed — phenomenology of effort used as evidence without engaging Dennett's position that such reports are behavioural data. Deferred: bedrock disagreement.
- **Quantum Skeptic** (Tegmark): Decoherence concerns noted only in Honest Limitations. Adequate for article scope.
- **Many-Worlds Defender** (Deutsch): Addressed in Relation to Site Perspective. Adequate.
- **Empiricist** (Popper): No falsifiable predictions offered. Acknowledged in Honest Limitations as a known gap.
- **Buddhist Philosopher** (Nagarjuna): Article assumes unified agent behind selection without addressing no-self perspectives. Deferred: would require significant expansion.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

Six sympathetic personas (Property Dualist, Quantum Mind Theorist, Phenomenologist, Process Philosopher, Libertarian Free Will Defender, Mysterian) identified strengths and opportunities.

### Strengths Preserved

- Opening summary: Excellent front-loading; core argument survives truncation
- "One Interface, Not Two" argument: Genuinely insightful philosophical point
- Three-layer selection architecture: Clear, memorable framework
- Desmurget dissociation: Clean mapping of neural evidence to framework
- Honest Limitations: Candid about locating vs illuminating the interface
- Relation to Site Perspective: Substantive engagement with all five tenets
- "Selecting what to perceive is already selecting what to do about it" — distinctive formulation

### Enhancements Made

- Added cross-link to [libet-experiments](/concepts/libet-experiments/) in Libet dissolution section
- Added [structure-of-attention](/topics/structure-of-attention/), [libet-experiments](/concepts/libet-experiments/), and [agent-causation](/concepts/agent-causation/) to Further Reading
- Softened QZE framing throughout to ensure core argument survives without it
- Improved Sjöberg section with richer philosophical analysis

### Cross-links Added

- [libet-experiments](/concepts/libet-experiments/) (inline and Further Reading)
- [structure-of-attention](/topics/structure-of-attention/) (Further Reading)
- [agent-causation](/concepts/agent-causation/) (Further Reading)

## Word Count

- Before: 2094 words (70% of 3000 soft threshold)
- After: 2298 words (77% of 3000 soft threshold)
- Net change: +204 words

Well within threshold. Additions from expanded Sjöberg discussion and cross-links.

## Remaining Items

- **Heterophenomenology engagement**: Could acknowledge Dennett's position that phenomenology reports are behavioural data. Deferred — bedrock disagreement, would require expansion.
- **No-self critique**: Could note selection phenomenology doesn't require a substantial self. Deferred — addressed elsewhere on the Map.
- **Falsifiable predictions**: No specific predictions offered. Known limitation of philosophical frameworks; acknowledged in Honest Limitations.
- **Neural competition sufficiency**: The claim that neural dynamics alone can't produce meaningful selection could be argued more carefully. The current formulation asserts this rather than demonstrating it.

## Stability Notes

This is the first review of this topic-level article (distinct from the concept-level file reviewed on 2026-01-26). The article was in good shape — well-structured with strong front-loading and an effective Relation to Site Perspective section. The main issues were attribution errors (Bengson authorship, Kaeser authorship), dropped nuance (Sjöberg, timing claims), and quantum Zeno overemphasis relative to the writing style guide.

Remaining items represent either bedrock philosophical disagreements (heterophenomenology, no-self, MWI) or known framework limitations (falsifiability). These should not be re-flagged as critical in future reviews unless new content introduces new problems.
