# Deep Review: Experiential Alignment

**Date**: 2026-01-20
**File**: obsidian/concepts/experiential-alignment.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The core argument is sound and well-structured.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Missing Illusionist Challenge**: The article assumed phenomenal consciousness exists without engaging the strongest objection.
   - **Resolution**: Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section with regress response, practical asymmetry argument, and contemplative evidence.

2. **Missing Process Philosophy Perspective**: Standard pattern missing.
   - **Resolution**: Added section connecting Whitehead's actual occasions, concrescence, and eternal objects to experiential alignment framework.

3. **Missing Contemplative Evidence**: No engagement with trained introspection as validation.
   - **Resolution**: Added section covering witness consciousness, jhana states, and Buddhist complications.

4. **Minimal Quantum Interaction Tenet Not Addressed**: Relation to Site Perspective section skipped this tenet.
   - **Resolution**: Added substantial paragraph connecting agency dimension to quantum selection mechanism and decoherence considerations.

5. **No Falsifiability Section**: Article didn't specify conditions under which experiential alignment would be reconsidered.
   - **Resolution**: Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section with five falsifiable conditions.

6. **Buddhist Complication Ignored**: Phenomenal value realism seemed to endorse attachment to positive experience, which Buddhist analysis critiques.
   - **Resolution**: Added Buddhist perspective in Contemplative Evidence section showing how the framework resonates with middle way thinking.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Illusionist objection**: Phenomenal consciousness is illusion, so there's no experiential target
  - Response: Regress argument (illusion presupposes experience), practical asymmetry, contemplative evidence

- **Dennettian objection**: Functional understanding suffices, no phenomenal states required
  - Response: The framework's claim is about what matters (experiential quality), not what exists

- **Buddhist objection**: Attachment to positive experience causes suffering
  - Response: Framework's diversity maintenance and suffering floor align with middle way; doesn't mandate maximizing pleasure

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Core argument that preferences are thin proxies for experiential quality
- Clear structure with eight-dimension framework
- Goodhart failure modes taxonomy
- Safeguards section is practical and well-specified
- Original voice and confident tone maintained

### Enhancements Made

1. Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section (3 subsections)
2. Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section (3 subsections)
3. Added "Contemplative Evidence" section (4 subsections)
4. Expanded "Relation to Site Perspective" from 4 tenets to all 5
5. Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section (5 conditions)
6. Expanded Further Reading from 6 to 11 links
7. Expanded References from 5 to 10 citations
