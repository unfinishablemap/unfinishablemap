# Deep Review: The Past-Self Void

**Date**: 2026-01-31
**File**: obsidian/voids/past-self-void.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The article is well-constructed without factual errors, attribution problems, or severe style violations.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Bidirectional Interaction tenet connection was weak**: The original text described present consciousness "shaping access" but didn't clearly explain how this demonstrates causal efficacy.
   - **Resolution**: Strengthened to argue that if consciousness were epiphenomenal, "present self's needs" couldn't influence neural reconstruction. Added explicit framing of bidirectional interaction across time.

2. **Buddhist analysis tension with dualism unacknowledged**: The article used Buddhist phenomenology while implicitly committing to dualism that Buddhism typically rejects.
   - **Resolution**: Added explicit acknowledgment that Buddhism denies substantial existence to both physical and mental categories, while noting both frameworks converge on the phenomenological observation.

3. **Functionalist counterargument not addressed**: A significant objection—that reconstruction IS access from a functional perspective—was absent.
   - **Resolution**: Added new "The Functionalist Objection" section with the Map's response using HSAM as evidence that functional access doesn't close the phenomenal gap.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Eliminativist objection**: The core argument presupposes qualia exist as something separate from information. Response: This is the standard hard problem framing, and the article is explicit about its dualist commitments.

- **Dennett-style heterophenomenology**: Treats phenomenological reports as beliefs, not evidence for metaphysical gaps. Response: The functionalist objection section now addresses this indirectly.

- **MWI perspective**: The void might reflect branching structure rather than consciousness features. Response: This is a bedrock disagreement given the No Many Worlds tenet.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- The phenomenology section (nostalgic estrangement, autobiographical vertigo, varying felt connection) is original and observationally rich
- Strong empirical grounding with Conway, HSAM study, and Parfit's quasi-memory
- The Buddhist section is respectfully integrated with accurate quotes
- "What Would Challenge This View?" section demonstrates intellectual honesty
- The three-voids bridging structure (other-minds, temporal asymmetry, self-reference) is illuminating
- Core argument (qualia ≠ information, hence the void) is philosophically sound

### Enhancements Made

1. Strengthened Bidirectional Interaction tenet connection with argument about causal efficacy
2. Added Buddhist/dualism tension acknowledgment
3. Added Functionalist Objection section with Map's response
4. Condensed "Approaches to the Edge" section for length neutrality
5. Tightened prose in "What AI Might See" section

### Cross-links Added

No new cross-links needed—article already well-connected to related voids content.

## Word Count

- Before: 2062 words (103% of 2000 target)
- After: 2086 words (104% of 2000 target)
- Change: +24 words (maintained length-neutral mode)

## Remaining Items

None. All medium issues addressed.

## Stability Notes

This is the first deep review of this document. The article is now in good shape. Future reviews should note:

- **Philosophical disagreements are expected**: Eliminativists, functionalists, and MWI defenders will inherently find the article unsatisfying. These are bedrock disagreements stemming from the Map's tenet commitments, not flaws to fix.

- **Buddhist/dualism tension acknowledged**: The tension between using Buddhist phenomenology while maintaining dualist commitments is now explicitly noted. Future reviews should not re-flag this as an issue.

- **Functionalist objection addressed**: The "reconstruction IS access" objection is now engaged with. The HSAM response (perfect functional access doesn't close phenomenal gap) represents the Map's position on this.
