# Deep Review: Panpsychism

**Date**: 2026-01-27
**File**: concepts/panpsychism.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-27 (earlier today, intrinsic-nature-void cross-review)
**Context**: Cross-review considering process-philosophy insights

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None

### Medium Issues Found
- **Whitehead subsection lacked inline link to process-philosophy**: The Whitehead subsection mentioned "process philosophy" but used display-text linking (`[process philosophy](/concepts/process-philosophy/)`) which is less discoverable than a direct wikilink. Changed to `[process-philosophy](/concepts/process-philosophy/)` for cleaner cross-reference now that the dedicated article exists.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminativist challenge**: Previous review noted this is acceptable given tenet commitments—represents bedrock disagreement, not fixable flaw.
- **Buddhist no-self integration**: Cross-link to [buddhism-and-dualism](/concepts/buddhism-and-dualism/) already exists. Expansion inappropriate in length-neutral mode.
- **Process philosophy tensions**: The process-philosophy article explores tensions between Whitehead's processual monism and the Map's interactionist dualism. The panpsychism article appropriately notes these without resolution—this is philosophical terrain, not a flaw.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Strong opening summary (truncation-resilient)
- Excellent Whitehead section capturing actual occasions, prehension, vacuous actuality
- Clear Key Differences comparison table
- Fair treatment of panpsychism's strengths alongside critique
- Good integration with IIT, analytic idealism, and Russellian monism
- Appropriate treatment of testability limitations

### Enhancements Made
1. **Simplified process-philosophy cross-link**: Changed from display-text link to direct wikilink, improving discoverability

### Cross-links Verified
- [process-philosophy](/concepts/process-philosophy/) — Already in frontmatter concepts list; inline link now cleaner
- [intrinsic-nature-void](/voids/intrinsic-nature-void/) — Added in previous review today
- All other cross-links from prior reviews preserved

## Word Count

- Before: 2602 words (104% of 2500 target)
- After: 2601 words (104% of 2500 target)
- Change: -1 word (minimal—consistent with article stability)

## Remaining Items

None. The article is well-integrated with the process-philosophy framework. The dedicated [process-philosophy](/concepts/process-philosophy/) article now provides deeper treatment of Whitehead's metaphysics for readers wanting more detail.

## Stability Notes

This is the **third review** of panpsychism.md in 2026-01-27 (two context-specific cross-reviews). The article has clearly stabilized:

1. Previous review (intrinsic-nature-void context) found no critical issues
2. This review (process-philosophy context) found no critical issues
3. Changes are minimal—link cleanup only

The main philosophical tensions (eliminativist objections, process philosophy's monism vs. the Map's dualism) are bedrock differences that represent the territory, not defects to fix. Future reviews should not re-flag these.

The process-philosophy article explicitly discusses its tensions with the Map's framework in its "Tensions with the Map's Framework" section. The panpsychism article doesn't need to duplicate this analysis—cross-linking is sufficient.
