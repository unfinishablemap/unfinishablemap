title: 'Apex Evolve Review: Time, Consciousness, and the Growing Block'
---

## Article Reviewed

[Time, Consciousness, and the Growing Block](/apex/time-consciousness-growing-block/)

## Changed Sources

2 sources modified after last synthesis (2026-02-01):

1. **[temporal-consciousness](/concepts/temporal-consciousness/)** — modified 2026-02-17, deep review 2026-02-22. Significantly expanded through coalescence of 4 articles (temporal-consciousness, specious-present, duration, temporal-unity). Added: working memory as neural correlate, mental time travel, temporal binding, temporal unity disruptions, illusionist challenge, sleep evidence, modified extensionalism position.

2. **[specious-present-temporal-experience](/concepts/specious-present-temporal-experience/)** — created 2026-02-22, deep review 2026-02-23. New focused article covering: extensionalism vs retentionalism debate, neurophenomenological bridge (Varela, Buddhist khanika), neuroscience of temporal windows, argument from temporal thickness, motor selection timing (280ms commitment point).

## Pessimistic Review

### Clarity Critic
- Opening two paragraphs pack the bidirectional thesis and implications densely; second paragraph reads as table of contents
- "Atemporal Selection" section is conceptually demanding; the "atemporal doesn't mean outside time" paragraph tries to do too much
- Process Philosophy section read more as Whitehead summary than thesis-connected synthesis

### Redundancy Hunter
- Libet problem appeared in both "Atemporal Selection" and "Free Will Reconsidered"
- Specious present described in dedicated section and re-described in "What Durée Feels Like"
- Synthesis section restated nearly every major claim without adding new insight

### Narrative Flow Analyst
- Transition from "What Durée Feels Like" to "Implications for AI" was abrupt
- Process Philosophy section felt orphaned before Synthesis
- Synthesis read as recapitulation rather than genuine synthesis

## Optimistic Review

### Connection Finder
- Modified extensionalism from both sources: sharpens the Map's philosophical position on temporal experience
- Argument from temporal thickness: focused syllogistic support for the hard problem section
- Temporal disruptions (schizophrenia, flow states): concrete evidence that temporal unity is a phenomenal achievement
- Sleep as negative evidence: powerful and universally relatable
- Motor selection timing (280ms): empirically grounds the free will connection
- Neurophenomenological bridge: strengthens contemplative evidence

### Synthesis Strengthener
- Extensionalism connects to growing block: experience is extended because collapse constitutes extended duration-blocks
- Temporal thickness argument provides crisp version of what the hard problem section argues discursively
- Temporal disruptions make the thesis concrete by showing what happens when constitution fails

### Human Reader Advocate
- Sleep is universally relatable — everyone has experienced waking knowing time passed without experiencing it
- Motor selection timing makes free will discussion empirically tangible rather than abstract
- Extensionalism/retentionalism debate adds philosophical depth for serious readers

## Length Assessment

- **Before**: 2,967 words
- **After**: 3,204 words
- **Change**: +237 words (net, after condensation and expansion)
- **Status**: Within 2500-4000 target range

## Summary of Changes

1. **Added extensionalism/retentionalism paragraph** to Specious Present section — established the Map's modified extensionalism position (experience genuinely extended through collapse-constituted duration-blocks)
2. **Expanded "What Durée Feels Like"** with temporal disruption evidence (schizophrenia, flow states) and dreamless sleep as negative evidence, replacing weaker hedged conclusion
3. **Added argument from temporal thickness** to Hard Problem section — focused syllogistic argument that physical description cannot capture experienced succession
4. **Streamlined Free Will section** — removed redundant Libet discussion (already covered in Atemporal Selection), added motor selection timing (280ms commitment point)
5. **Rewrote Synthesis section** — replaced recapitulative bullet points with genuine synthesis showing how convergence of independent evidence lines distinguishes the framework from standard positions
6. **Tightened Process Philosophy section** — reframed as anticipating rather than merely paralleling the thesis; removed unnecessary detail
7. **Updated source reference** for specious-present to match actual filename (specious-present-temporal-experience)
8. **Added Thura & Cisek reference** and corrected Hoel citation
9. **Updated frontmatter** — ai_modified, apex_last_synthesis, ai_system, modified date
