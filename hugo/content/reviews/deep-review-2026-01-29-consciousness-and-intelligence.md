**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Quantum mechanism claim lacked engagement with decoherence objection**: The Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet connection made a physical claim without acknowledging the serious scientific challenge from decoherence timescales. Resolution: Added explicit reference to [quantum-decoherence-objection](/quantum-decoherence-objection/) and acknowledged it as a serious challenge while noting corrected calculations.

### Medium Issues Found
- **MWI dismissal too quick**: The original text stated branching "would undermine selectivity" without engaging the MWI response that each branch has determinate outcomes. Resolution: Expanded to address the MWI response directly, explaining the Map's view that this multiplies decision-makers rather than preserving the selecting agent.

- **Heterophenomenology not acknowledged**: Dennett's methodological alternative for studying consciousness was not mentioned. Resolution: Added wikilink to [heterophenomenology](/concepts/heterophenomenology/) in the phenomenal consciousness discussion as an alternative methodological approach.

- **Explanatory gap not wikilinked**: The term appeared without linking to the dedicated concept page. Resolution: Added proper wikilink to [explanatory-gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/).

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Tegmark's decoherence objection**: Now explicitly acknowledged with reference to the detailed treatment in the concept page
- **MWI branching response**: Now directly addressed—the Map's response is that genuine deliberation requires a single outcome, not parallel realisations
- **Heterophenomenology as methodology**: Now mentioned as an alternative approach the Map does not adopt

### Issues Not Flagged as Critical (Philosophical Disagreements)
- Eliminative materialist objection that folk categories like "qualia" may not carve nature at its joints—this is a bedrock philosophical disagreement
- Buddhist perspective on dependent origination of consciousness categories—valid perspective but not a flaw in the article
- Empiricist concern about unfalsifiability of consciousness-as-amplifier hypothesis—acknowledged but the hypothesis makes specific predictions about the human-ape gap

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- **Four-position framework**: The clear structure (Independence, Intelligence requires consciousness, Consciousness requires intelligence, Deep interdependence) is pedagogically excellent and was preserved
- **Opening summary**: Effectively front-loads the Map's position with strong claims that survive truncation
- **Great ape evidence as empirical anchor**: Using comparative cognition to ground abstract philosophical claims is a strong argumentative strategy
- **Phenomenal vs. access consciousness distinction**: Correctly deployed at the right point in the argument
- **All five tenet connections**: The Relation to Site Perspective section connects each tenet substantively

### Enhancements Made
- Added explicit engagement with decoherence objection in the quantum interaction tenet section
- Expanded MWI response to directly address the branching counterargument
- Added heterophenomenology as acknowledged alternative methodology
- Added three new concept cross-links to frontmatter

### Cross-links Added
- [quantum-decoherence-objection](/quantum-decoherence-objection/)
- [heterophenomenology](/concepts/heterophenomenology/)
- [explanatory-gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/) (proper wikilink added in body text)

## Word Count

Before: 2011 words
After: ~2070 words (+59 words, still well within 3000-word soft threshold)

## Remaining Items

None. All critical issues addressed. Medium issues addressed or represent philosophical disagreements that are expected given the Map's position.

## Stability Notes

The following represent fundamental philosophical disagreements rather than fixable problems:

1. **Eliminative materialist objection**: The claim that folk psychological categories like "qualia" may not accurately describe reality is a bedrock philosophical disagreement. The Map takes phenomenal consciousness as a datum; eliminativists deny this. Future reviews should not re-flag this as critical.

2. **Buddhist non-self analysis**: The article assumes consciousness is a unified phenomenon; Buddhist analysis questions this. This is a legitimate philosophical alternative, not an error in the article.

3. **Empiricist unfalsifiability concern**: The consciousness-as-amplifier hypothesis could be seen as unfalsifiable, but it does make specific predictions about which capacities should track consciousness. Whether these are adequate for scientific testing is a methodological debate, not an article flaw.

4. **MWI defender response**: The MWI position that each branch has determinate outcomes is now explicitly addressed. The disagreement about whether branching preserves or undermines genuine selection is a bedrock metaphysical dispute between the Map and many-worlds interpretations.
