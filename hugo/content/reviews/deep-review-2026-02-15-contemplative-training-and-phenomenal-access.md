**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

- **Weng et al. (2013) misattribution**: Article claimed compassion training was compared against "attention training" — actual control was reappraisal training. Fixed to "reappraisal training."
- **Demir et al. (2025) false attribution of "increased brain entropy"**: The entropy finding comes from a different paper (Chowdhury et al. 2024), not Demir et al. which studied functional connectivity gradients. Removed entropy claim from both occurrences, corrected to describe what Demir et al. actually found (reorganised functional connectivity gradients, disrupted hierarchical organisation, global integration).
- **Overstated Demir et al. findings**: Article claimed "distinct neural signatures" for each jhana state — the case study shows overall reorganisation patterns, not individually distinguishable per-state signatures. Qualified language accordingly.

### Medium Issues Found

- **Fox et al. (2012) context**: Placed after temporal microstructure discussion implying it supports that specific claim; actually measured body-scanning accuracy. Resolution: clarified that Fox et al. measured body-scanning specifically and that the logarithmic pattern is suggestive of a general skill-acquisition dynamic.
- **Anti-illusionism convergence argument**: Did not address the materialist counter that convergence between reports and neural states is exactly what improved self-monitoring circuits would produce. Resolution: added paragraph addressing this objection, explaining why convergence undermines illusionism specifically even if compatible with materialism broadly.
- **Anti-reductive straw man**: "neuroscience should make trained introspection obsolete" is not a claim reductive materialists actually make. Resolution: reframed to focus on the explanatory gap prediction (that the gap should close with better measurement) and added knowledge argument connection.
- **No Many Worlds tenet connection unargued**: Witness-consciousness/collapse link was asserted without justification. Resolution: qualified as speculative, reframed around whether consciousness can genuinely modulate its relationship to physical outcomes.
- **Demir et al. case study qualification**: "7-Tesla fMRI confirms" implied strong evidence from a single-subject study. Resolution: changed to "case study found" throughout.
- **Unused references**: Petitmengin (2006), Thompson (2007), Varela (1996) cited in References but never in text. Resolution: removed.

### Counterarguments Considered

- Materialist self-monitoring counter to convergence argument (addressed in revised anti-illusionism section)
- Illusionist compatibility with convergence (addressed with nuanced response about misrepresentation vs. accurate representation)
- Reductive materialist reframing of complementarity (addressed by distinguishing method-level from ontology-level reduction)

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Four-stage developmental model (Surface Observation → Temporal Microstructure → Awareness-Content Distinction → Non-Ordinary States) — architecturally sound and original
- Neurophenomenological anti-illusionist argument (post-refinement) — strongest version on the Map
- Cross-traditional convergence section with honest qualifications about lineage transmission
- Skill analogy with self-critique about the calibration problem
- Bidirectional interaction tenet connection through the full causal cycle
- Epistemic qualifications throughout ("suggestive rather than conclusive," "strong but not indubitable")

### Enhancements Made

- Added knowledge argument connection in anti-reductive section (each training stage reveals phenomenal facts not predictable from neural description)
- Added [explanatory-gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/) link in anti-reductive section
- Added [paradox-of-effortless-mastery](/paradox-of-effortless-mastery/) to Further Reading and related_articles
- Added [temporal-consciousness](/concepts/temporal-consciousness/) and [explanatory-gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/) to frontmatter concepts
- Strengthened anti-illusionism by addressing materialist self-monitoring objection

### Cross-links Added

- [explanatory-gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/) (body text and frontmatter)
- [knowledge-argument](/concepts/knowledge-argument/) (body text)
- [temporal-consciousness](/concepts/temporal-consciousness/) (frontmatter)
- [paradox-of-effortless-mastery](/paradox-of-effortless-mastery/) (Further Reading and frontmatter)

## Remaining Items

- The optimistic review identified potential cross-links to [phenomenal-depth](/concepts/phenomenal-depth/), [acquaintance-knowledge](/concepts/acquaintance-knowledge/), and [contemplative-reliability](/concepts/contemplative-reliability/) — these could be added in a future review if those concept pages are sufficiently developed.
- The temporal microstructure section could note the convergence with Whiteheadian process philosophy (Buddhist khanavada + Husserlian retention-protention + Whitehead's actual occasions) — deferred as an expansion opportunity.

## Stability Notes

- The No Many Worlds tenet connection is inherently speculative given the article's empirical focus. Future reviews should not attempt to strengthen this connection beyond what the evidence supports — the current qualified treatment is appropriate.
- The six adversarial personas disagreed with the article's dualist conclusions as expected. These disagreements are philosophical standoffs, not fixable flaws. The article engages with the strongest objections (independence problem, calibration problem) honestly.
- The anti-illusionism section has now been refined twice (2026-02-11 and 2026-02-15). It should be considered stable unless new evidence or arguments emerge.
