# Tenet Alignment Check

**Date**: 2026-02-11
**Files checked**: 280 (106 topics + 174 concepts)
**Errors**: 0
**Warnings**: 0
**Notes**: 0

## Summary

All site content aligns with the five foundational tenets. No genuine violations were found.

The analysis employed a two-stage process:
1. **Automated pattern matching** - Identified 79 potential issues by searching for keywords associated with opposing views (materialism, epiphenomenalism, many-worlds, etc.)
2. **Context-aware filtering** - Manual verification revealed all flagged instances were pedagogically appropriate discussions that explain opposing views in order to critique them

## Key Findings

### Tenet Compliance by Category

#### 1. Dualism ✓
All content treats consciousness as irreducible to physical processes. Files that discuss eliminative materialism, reductive physicalism, or illusionism do so explicitly to critique these positions. Dedicated articles (`illusionism.md`, `epiphenomenalism.md`, `materialism.md`) properly explain opposing views while mounting systematic objections aligned with the dualist commitment.

#### 2. Minimal Quantum Interaction ✓
No endorsement of quantum mysticism or "quantum woo" found. The `quantum-consciousness.md` article explicitly distinguishes legitimate scientific proposals (Orch OR, Stapp) from pseudoscientific misappropriations. All quantum mechanism references properly constrain claims to minimal interaction without energy injection or conservation law violations.

#### 3. Bidirectional Interaction ✓
All discussions of epiphenomenalism frame it as a rejected position. The `epiphenomenalism.md` article extensively develops the self-stultification argument against causal inertness. No files assume consciousness is causally inefficacious; many explicitly argue for its causal role in cognitive functions.

#### 4. No Many Worlds ✓
Every mention of many-worlds interpretation occurs in one of three contexts:
- Explaining MWI to contrast with collapse interpretations
- Using MWI as a foil to motivate indexical identity concerns
- Explicitly rejecting MWI per the tenets

The `measurement-problem.md` article labels MWI as "**Directly rejected**" and links to the tenets.

#### 5. Occam's Razor Has Limits ✓
No files use parsimony decisively against dualism. Multiple articles (`dualism.md`, `tenets.md`, `substance-property-dualism.md`) explicitly argue that simplicity is an unreliable guide when conceptual resources may be inadequate.

## Structural Patterns Supporting Alignment

The content architecture includes several features that ensure tenet compliance:

1. **Dedicated opposition articles**: Controversial positions receive full articles that explain them thoroughly before critique
2. **Explicit tenet links**: Articles regularly link back to `tenets.md` with anchor links to specific commitments
3. **"Relation to Site Perspective" sections**: Many articles conclude with explicit discussion of alignment with or challenges to the tenets
4. **Consistent framing language**: "Illusionists claim..." / "Epiphenomenalists hold..." / "The materialist argues..." followed by systematic objections

## Pedagogical Approach

The content properly balances:
- **Fair explanation** of opposing views (intellectual honesty and comprehensiveness)
- **Systematic critique** aligned with tenet commitments
- **Comprehensive context** for readers exploring consciousness studies

Files discussing materialism, epiphenomenalism, illusionism, and many-worlds do so in the manner expected of a philosophical resource—steel-manning opponents before rebutting them.

## Files Analyzed

**223 files (80%)** had zero mentions of opposing views even in automated pattern matching. These focus on:
- Phenomenological description
- Dualist-compatible theories
- Neutral topics (memory, attention, temporal structure)
- Mechanisms consistent with the tenets

**57 files (20%)** discuss opposing views in sufficient detail that automated keyword matching flagged them. Manual review confirmed all such discussions are pedagogically appropriate explanations followed by critique.

## Representative Clean Files

### Concepts
- `qualia.md`
- `interactionist-dualism.md`
- `quantum-consciousness.md`
- `filter-theory.md`
- `knowledge-argument.md`
- `philosophical-zombies.md`
- `attention-as-interface.md`

### Topics
- `hard-problem-of-consciousness.md`
- `free-will.md`
- `evolutionary-case-for-mental-causation.md`
- `argument-from-reason.md`
- `contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness-theories.md`
- `indexical-identity-quantum-measurement.md`

## Conclusion

All 280 files demonstrate consistent philosophical commitment to the dualist, interactionist framework defined in the tenets while engaging fairly and comprehensively with opposing positions. No corrections needed.
