# Deep Review: Spontaneous Collapse Theories

**Date**: 2026-01-27
**File**: obsidian/concepts/spontaneous-collapse-theories.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-24
**Context**: Cross-review considering new prebiotic-collapse.md article

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Applied six adversarial personas: Eliminative Materialist, Hard-Nosed Physicalist, Quantum Skeptic, Many-Worlds Defender, Empiricist, Buddhist Philosopher.

### Critical Issues Found

None. The previous review (2026-01-24) addressed all critical issues including the illusionist challenge section, mysterian caveat, and references.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **McQueen citation needed clarification**: The article claimed "McQueen & Chalmers 2014 preprint" but this specific preprint couldn't be verified. Resolution: Simplified to "Kelvin McQueen has proposed combining CSL with Integrated Information Theory" without the unverifiable citation.

2. **Cross-reference to prebiotic-collapse.md could be stronger**: The article linked to [prebiotic-collapse](/concepts/prebiotic-collapse/) in Further Reading but didn't substantively integrate it. Resolution: Added parenthetical in "The Prebiotic Collapse Problem" section directing readers to the dedicated page for extended treatment including process philosophy perspectives.

### Low Issues Found

None requiring action.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Illusionist objection**: Already addressed in previous review
- **MWI alternative**: Properly dismissed as site tenet alignment (bedrock disagreement, not fixable flaw)
- **Decoherence timescale objection**: Already addressed with appropriate hedging

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

Applied six sympathetic personas: Property Dualist, Quantum Mind Theorist, Phenomenologist, Process Philosopher, Libertarian Free Will Defender, Mysterian.

### Strengths Preserved

- Excellent opening summary front-loading the "modulation vs. causation" insight
- Clear comparison table of major theories with tenet alignment
- The CSL-IIT hybrid discussion (valuable philosophical work)
- Mysterian caveat section (intellectually honest)
- Free will connection in Relation to Site Perspective
- Appropriate hedging on disputed claims ("disputed," "remains contested")
- Comprehensive cross-links in Further Reading

### Enhancements Made

1. Added cross-reference to [prebiotic-collapse](/concepts/prebiotic-collapse/) in body text (The Prebiotic Collapse Problem section)
2. Fixed McQueen citation by removing unverifiable preprint claim

### Cross-links Added

- Strengthened in-text reference to [prebiotic-collapse](/concepts/prebiotic-collapse/) (already in Further Reading and concepts frontmatter)

## Remaining Items

None. Article is now well-integrated with the prebiotic-collapse page and properly cites sources.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed twice (2026-01-24, 2026-01-27). The first review addressed significant gaps; this cross-review made minor integration improvements. The article is approaching stability:

- **Bedrock disagreements acknowledged**: MWI defenders will find the indexical argument unpersuasive; this is a philosophical standoff, not a flaw to fix
- **Illusionist challenge addressed**: Response via argument-from-reason is in place; further strengthening would require dedicated treatment elsewhere
- **Speculative elements properly hedged**: CSL-IIT hybrid, coherence timescales all appropriately caveated

Future reviews should not re-flag these as critical unless new problems arise. Word count remains under threshold (approximately 2310 words after additions).
