title: Deep Review - Value-Blind vs Value-Sensitive Selection
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-03-02
**Article**: [Value-Blind vs Value-Sensitive Selection](/topics/value-blind-vs-value-sensitive-selection/)
**Previous review**: [2026-02-22](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-22-value-blind-vs-value-sensitive-selection/)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article remains stable since the previous review. All attribution checks pass. No source/Map conflation, no self-contradictions, no dropped qualifiers detected.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Imprecise terminology**: "intact functional pain processing" (line 68) should be "intact sensory pain processing" for consistency with the valence article and the pain-asymbolia clinical literature. The pain-asymbolia condition involves damaged *functional* processing (the affective-motivational layer is disrupted); what remains intact is the *sensory-discriminative* processing. (Fixed)
- **Orphan status**: The article had zero inbound links from any other article on the site despite being referenced by 9 articles in its own Further Reading section. This severely limits discoverability. (Fixed — 9 inbound links added across 9 articles)

### Attribution Accuracy Check
All claims re-verified against source articles:

| Claim | Source | Accuracy |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Valence "lacks a developed mechanism" for selection | selection-laws.md | Correct |
| Pain asymbolia: absent felt badness changes behavior | valence.md, pain-asymbolia.md | Correct |
| Consciousness necessary for value | consciousness-value-connection.md | Correct |
| Setpoint includes "agent's intentions, values, goals" | control-theoretic-will.md | Correct (line 56) |
| Conscious beings act for reasons | agent-teleology.md | Correct |
| Stapp model: attention → observation rate → pattern stability | stapp-quantum-mind.md | Correct |
| All five tenet connections | tenets.md | Correct |

No misattributions, dropped qualifiers, source/Map conflation, or self-contradictions detected.

### Counterarguments Considered
All six adversarial personas engaged:
- **Eliminative Materialist**: Fork presupposes dualist selection — correctly grounded in Map's own commitments (opening paragraph)
- **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: Middle path converges with functionalist attention-modulation — acknowledged transparently (line 126-127)
- **Quantum Skeptic**: Testability hooks conflate neural and quantum levels — predictions appropriately framed as neural predictions, not quantum confirmations
- **MWI Defender**: Fork dissolves under Many Worlds — addressed in Relation to Site Perspective (line 139)
- **Empiricist**: Testability hooks are specific and differentiated — among the most testable philosophical content on the site
- **Buddhist Philosopher**: Contemplative perspectives on valence could be explored further — low priority expansion

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- **Fork structure**: Genuinely illuminating binary forced by the Map's own commitments
- **Pain asymbolia deployment**: Effectively bridges phenomenal value realism with causal efficacy
- **Testability hooks**: Specific, differentiated predictions for each horn — among the most testable content on the site
- **Middle path honesty**: Transparent about costs of the graduated position
- **Anticipation problem** (lines 98-100): Original philosophical puzzle about predicted vs experienced valence
- **Comprehensive tenet analysis**: All five tenets receive substantive treatment
- **Opening paragraph**: Front-loads the core question effectively

### Enhancements Made
- Fixed "intact functional pain processing" → "intact sensory pain processing" for clinical accuracy
- Added 9 inbound links from related articles to resolve orphan status:
  - **valence.md**: Body text sentence + Further Reading entry
  - **selection-laws.md**: Body text sentence extending the "undeveloped mechanism" note
  - **agent-teleology.md**: Further Reading entry
  - **consciousness-value-connection.md**: Body text sentence in Bidirectional Interaction section
  - **control-theoretic-will.md**: Body text sentence after setpoint discussion
  - **phenomenal-value-realism.md**: Body text sentence in "Against Epiphenomenal Value" section
  - **stapp-quantum-mind.md**: Further Reading entry
  - **epiphenomenalism.md**: Further Reading entry
  - **pain-asymbolia.md**: Further Reading entry
  - **pain-asymbolia-as-central-test-case.md**: Further Reading entry

### Cross-links Added
- [value-blind-vs-value-sensitive-selection](/topics/value-blind-vs-value-sensitive-selection/) linked FROM: valence, selection-laws, agent-teleology, consciousness-value-connection, control-theoretic-will, phenomenal-value-realism, stapp-quantum-mind, epiphenomenalism, pain-asymbolia, pain-asymbolia-as-central-test-case (10 inbound links total)

## Remaining Items

None. The article is stable, well-structured, accurately sourced, and now well-integrated into the site's link network.

## Stability Notes

The adversarial personas' fundamental objections (eliminative materialist rejecting dualist premises, MWI defender dissolving the fork) are bedrock philosophical disagreements handled by the article's framing. Future reviews should not re-flag these.

The previous review's stability notes remain valid: the article honestly acknowledges mechanism gaps, which is a strength. The fork structure itself is an original philosophical contribution that should be preserved across future edits.

The article has now been reviewed twice with no critical issues found in either review. It has reached stability. Future reviews should focus on whether new Map content has created additional cross-linking opportunities, not on re-examining the article's arguments.
