title: Deep Review - The Knowledge Argument (Mary's Room)
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-28
**Article**: [The Knowledge Argument (Mary's Room)](/concepts/knowledge-argument/)
**Previous review**: [2026-02-05](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-05-knowledge-argument/)

## Cross-Review Context

This review was triggered as a cross-review considering insights from the-case-for-dualism.md (arguments-against-materialism). That article presents the knowledge argument as one of several converging arguments for dualism, listing eight arguments in its convergence section. This review focused on ensuring consistency between the two articles' convergence claims.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None

### Medium Issues Found
- **Argument count discrepancy with source article**: The convergence paragraph said "one of seven major arguments against materialism" but the-case-for-dualism.md's convergence section lists eight converging arguments. The list also omitted unity of consciousness and intentionality while including quantum mechanical considerations (which the source's own convergence section doesn't list). Display text also referenced the old article name "arguments against materialism" instead of "The Case for Dualism." Resolution: Updated count to "several converging arguments for dualism" (robust against future changes) and updated the list to match the source article's convergence section.
- **Article at 121% of soft threshold (3030 words)**: Compressed the Reliability of Consciousness Intuitions section by removing the tangential experimental philosophy paragraph and merging the framing effects point into the main paragraph.
- **Further Reading link text outdated**: Referenced "seven converging anti-materialist arguments." Resolution: Updated to "several converging arguments for dualism."

### Low Issues Found
- **AI refinement log**: HTML comment at bottom of file (from 2026-02-16 changes) stated "This log should be removed after human review." Resolution: Removed.

### Counterarguments Considered
- All major counterarguments were addressed in previous reviews. No new gaps identified.

### Notes from Previous Reviews
The 2026-01-20 review addressed: unverified survey statistic, missing falsifiability section, illusionism engagement, introspection question, process philosophy perspective.
The 2026-01-26 review addressed: cross-link to consciousness-only-territories, acquaintance knowledge subsection.
The 2026-01-27 review addressed: cross-link to intrinsic-nature-void.
The 2026-02-05 review addressed: cross-link to objectivity-and-consciousness, Jackson interview citation fix.

These issues remain resolved. This review did not re-flag them.

## Attribution Accuracy Check

All attributions verified:
- Jackson (1982, 1986) as formulator: correct
- Lewis and Nemirow for ability hypothesis: correct
- Loar, Papineau for phenomenal concepts strategy: correct
- Chalmers for "master argument" against PCS: correct
- Dennett's position fairly characterized: correct (settled in previous reviews)
- Whitehead for process philosophy: correct
- Russell for structure/intrinsic nature insight: correct
- Fox et al. (2012) correctly cited: correct
- Nisbett and Wilson correctly referenced: correct

No dropped qualifiers, source/Map conflation, or self-contradictions detected.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear five-step formalization of the argument
- Fair treatment of four physicalist responses (ability hypothesis, PCS, Dennett's denial, illusionism)
- Jackson's self-rejection leveraged to support bidirectional interaction tenet
- Strong convergence argument paragraph (now updated to match source)
- Well-calibrated intuition reliability section
- Introspection defense with empirical citations
- Process philosophy/Russellian monism integration
- Objectivity paradox and consciousness-only-territories connections
- "What Would Challenge This View?" section with five falsification conditions

### Enhancements Made
- Updated convergence argument to match the-case-for-dualism.md: corrected count, updated argument list, fixed display text
- Compressed Reliability of Consciousness Intuitions: removed experimental philosophy paragraph, merged framing effects
- Updated Further Reading link text
- Removed stale AI refinement log

### Cross-links Verified
- [the-case-for-dualism](/concepts/the-case-for-dualism/) — convergence argument (link text updated)
- All existing cross-links intact and accurate

## Length Analysis

- **Before**: 3030 words (121% of 2500 soft threshold)
- **After**: 2934 words (117% of 2500 soft threshold)
- **Change**: -96 words

Operating in length-neutral mode. Compressed the intuition reliability section (~130 words removed) while the convergence argument update was roughly length-neutral. Net reduction of 96 words. The article remains above soft threshold but further cuts would require removing substantive sections.

## Remaining Items

None. The changes are minor consistency fixes and length trimming.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed five times (2026-01-20, 2026-01-26, 2026-01-27, 2026-02-05, 2026-02-28). Each subsequent review has made progressively smaller changes:
- First review: substantial additions (illusionism, introspection, process philosophy, falsifiability)
- Second review: targeted cross-linking (consciousness-only-territories)
- Third review: minimal cross-linking (intrinsic-nature-void)
- Fourth review: cross-review cross-linking (objectivity-and-consciousness), citation fix
- Fifth review: consistency fix (convergence argument count), length trimming, cleanup

The article is **mature and stable**. The following represent settled positions that future reviews should NOT re-flag:
- The treatment of Dennett's response as "missing the point" is a philosophical judgment, not a flaw
- The convergence argument is now aligned with the-case-for-dualism.md
- Physicalist critics will always find the "learning claim" intuition unconvincing — bedrock philosophical disagreement
- The Russellian monism/intrinsic nature connection is complete
- The objectivity paradox connection is established
- The intuition reliability section is appropriately balanced

Future reviews should focus only on:
- New cross-linking opportunities as related content is created
- Factual errors if discovered
- Style guide changes that affect this content
- Further length reduction if article continues to grow
