# Deep Review: Cognitive Phenomenology

**Date**: 2026-01-20
**File**: obsidian/concepts/cognitive-phenomenology.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Missing Illusionist Challenge section**: The article had no engagement with the illusionist position, which is the strongest physicalist challenge to cognitive phenomenology. Resolution: Added comprehensive "The Illusionist Challenge" section with regress response and phenomenology-survives-analysis subsections.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing "What Would Challenge This View?" section**: Standard for site articles but absent. Resolution: Added section with 5 falsifiability conditions.
- **Missing Process Philosophy Perspective**: Other reviewed articles now include this dimension. Resolution: Added section covering prehension, concrescence, and why cognitive phenomenology is sui generis.
- **Missing Contemplative Evidence section**: No engagement with meditative evidence. Resolution: Added section covering witness consciousness, jhāna states, and insight phenomenology.
- **Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet not addressed**: The Relation to Site Perspective section covered only 4 of 5 tenets. Resolution: Expanded to include Minimal Quantum Interaction with connection to semantic selection.
- **Missing cross-links**: Article lacked links to illusionism, introspection, witness-consciousness, decoherence, haecceity, attention-as-interface. Resolution: Added to concepts frontmatter and Further Reading section.

### Low Issues Found
- **Inconsistent "the site" capitalization**: Two instances used lowercase. Resolution: Fixed to "this site".

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Illusionist deflationary account**: Addressed through regress response and introspective reliability asymmetry
- **Sensory accompaniment thesis**: Acknowledged in existing conservative position section; reinforced by aphantasia evidence
- **Introspective unreliability**: Addressed through distinction between reliable domains (phenomenal states) and unreliable domains (causal processes)

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent opening that clearly frames the AI consciousness stakes
- Strong use of Strawson's foreign language argument
- Well-articulated phenomenal intentionality thesis (PIT) section
- Distinctive semantic memory evidence (TOT, FOK, noetic consciousness)
- Clear liberal/conservative framing of the debate

### Enhancements Made
- Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section with three subsections (illusionist accommodation, regress response, phenomenology survives analysis)
- Added "Contemplative Evidence" section with three subsections (witness consciousness, jhāna states, insight phenomenology)
- Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section covering prehension, concrescence, and sui generis character
- Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section with 5 falsifiability conditions
- Expanded Relation to Site Perspective to cover all 5 tenets with substantive connections
- Strengthened cross-references throughout

### Cross-links Added
- [illusionism](/concepts/illusionism/) — The eliminativist challenge and its regress problem
- [witness-consciousness](/concepts/witness-consciousness/) — Contemplative access to cognitive experience
- [attention-as-interface](/concepts/attention-as-interface/) — The quantum mechanism that may underlie understanding
- [haecceity](/concepts/haecceity/) — Why *this* understanding cannot be replicated
- [decoherence](/concepts/decoherence/) — Quantum coherence and the selection mechanism
