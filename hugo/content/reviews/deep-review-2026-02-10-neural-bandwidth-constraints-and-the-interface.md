## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Musical performance bit rate unverifiable**: Table claimed "Musical performance: ~10-12 bits/second" attributed to Zheng & Meister, but this specific rate could not be verified in the paper. **Resolution**: Removed the row from the table.

2. **Reading rate cherry-picked**: Paper gives 28-45 bits/s for reading; article reported only "~45 bits/second." **Resolution**: Changed to "~28-45 bits/second" showing the full range.

3. **Table presented as direct paper findings but contained hybrid data**: The framing implied all entries came directly from the paper. **Resolution**: Removed unverifiable entry, corrected ranges, and changed "paper" to "perspective article" for accuracy.

### Medium Issues Found

- **Decision-making rate had unsourced lower bound**: Paper reports ~5 bits/s; article said "3-5." **Resolution**: Changed to "~5 bits/second" labeled as "Choice-reaction tasks."
- **Retina figure understated**: Article said 10^7; paper says ~10^8. **Resolution**: Changed to "10^8" and "optic nerve" for precision.
- **"Peripheral nerve fibres" misleading**: Paper gives 10^9 for aggregate sensory input, not a specific pathway. **Resolution**: Changed to "Aggregate sensory input."
- **Schwartz 1996 interpretation conflated with data**: Article attributed "directing sustained attention" framework to the 1996 empirical paper, but this comes from Schwartz's 2002 interpretive work. **Resolution**: Reworded to distinguish the 1996 findings from the later interpretive framework, added 2002 reference.
- **Automatisation argument strawmanned physicalism**: Claimed automatisation is a "puzzle" for production models when controlled-to-automatic processing is well-understood. **Resolution**: Rewrote to acknowledge the physicalist account while arguing the interface model offers a more parsimonious explanation.
- **MWI argument contained a philosophical error**: Claimed MWI makes the bottleneck "serve no function" when branch observers still experience serial cognition. **Resolution**: Rewrote to acknowledge the MWI per-branch objection, then explain why the Map reads the constraint as genuine selection cost.
- **Filter model's psychedelic prediction lacked support**: "Routinely reported as richer" was unsupported. **Resolution**: Added reference to entropic brain research and reworded to connect subjective richness to neural entropy findings.
- **Missing cross-links**: Article discussed GWT, Libet, access consciousness without linking to existing site articles. **Resolution**: Added wikilinks to [global-workspace-theory](/concepts/global-workspace-theory/), [libet-experiments](/concepts/libet-experiments/), [access-consciousness](/concepts/access-consciousness/), [quantum-indeterminacy-free-will](/concepts/quantum-indeterminacy-free-will/), [dream-consciousness-and-the-filter-model](/topics/dream-consciousness-and-the-filter-model/), [neuroplasticity](/concepts/neuroplasticity/).

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Bandwidth bottleneck as standard computational architecture**: Addressed by noting that typical parallel-to-serial narrowing is hundreds/thousands, not 10^8. The extreme ratio is what demands explanation.
- **Global Workspace Theory as sufficient explanation**: Engaged more substantively — acknowledged GWT describes the bottleneck well but doesn't explain why the ratio is so extreme or why it occurs at conscious access specifically.
- **MWI compatibility with bandwidth data**: Acknowledged explicitly and responded with the Map's reading of selection as ontologically real, not merely branch-local.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Opening paragraph: quantitative, front-loaded, truncation-resilient
- The "factory with a million workers" analogy
- William James's prism analogy
- CEO analogy for the selection model
- "You cannot choose among options that haven't been prepared yet" — strongest single sentence
- Falsification section with four specific conditions
- All five tenet connections (enhanced, not replaced)
- Empirical-to-philosophical escalation structure

### Enhancements Made

- Strengthened GWT engagement (acknowledged as strongest materialist competitor)
- Added neuroplasticity cross-link for Schwartz discussion
- Added dream consciousness cross-link for altered states
- Added access consciousness cross-link for the bottleneck description
- Improved MWI tenet connection with honest engagement of the branch-local objection
- Replaced strawman automatisation argument with balanced comparison

### Cross-links Added

- [global-workspace-theory](/concepts/global-workspace-theory/)
- [libet-experiments](/concepts/libet-experiments/)
- [access-consciousness](/concepts/access-consciousness/)
- [quantum-indeterminacy-free-will](/concepts/quantum-indeterminacy-free-will/)
- [dream-consciousness-and-the-filter-model](/topics/dream-consciousness-and-the-filter-model/)
- [neuroplasticity](/concepts/neuroplasticity/)

## Remaining Items

- The ~3-4 selections/second derivation assumes "binary-to-quaternary choice complexity" without justification. This is flagged as approximate but could be strengthened with citation in a future review.
- The altered states prediction could be further developed with specific citations (Carhart-Harris entropic brain hypothesis). Currently improved but not fully cited.
- Comparative bandwidth across species (human vs. other animals) is unexplored and could strengthen the argument. This is an expansion opportunity for future work.
- The filter model makes no quantitative predictions that distinguish it from production models given the same data. This is an honest limitation the article doesn't fully address.

## Stability Notes

- The six adversarial personas raised philosophical disagreements that are expected and not fixable: eliminativists will always question the category of "conscious processing"; physicalists will always find the parallel-to-serial analogy sufficient; quantum skeptics will always challenge the quantum mechanism. These are bedrock disagreements that future reviews should NOT re-flag as critical.
- The No Many Worlds connection is inherently the weakest tenet link for this article because the bandwidth data is compatible with both collapse and branching interpretations. The revised version acknowledges this honestly.
