title: Deep Review - Epiphenomenalism
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-01-29
**Article**: [Epiphenomenalism](/concepts/epiphenomenalism/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-28](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-28-epiphenomenalism/)
**Cross-review context**: consciousness-and-intelligence.md

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. Article remains stable after fourth review.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Broken internal link**: `[...](/concepts/consciousness-as-amplifier/)` should be `[...](/concepts/consciousness-as-amplifier/)`. The file is named `consciousness-as-amplifier.md`.
   - **Resolution**: Fixed the wikilink to point to correct file.

2. **Missing bidirectional cross-reference**: The new `consciousness-and-intelligence.md` article explicitly discusses epiphenomenalism as a rival position, but epiphenomenalism.md did not link back to it.
   - **Resolution**: Added `[consciousness-and-intelligence](/topics/consciousness-and-intelligence/)` to concepts frontmatter.

### Counterarguments Considered

All six adversarial personas applied with cross-review focus:

1. **Eliminative Materialist**: No issues from cross-review context.
2. **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: Both articles discuss functionalism; no conflicts found.
3. **Quantum Skeptic**: Quantum mechanisms appropriately hedged in both.
4. **Many-Worlds Defender**: Bedrock disagreement unchanged.
5. **Empiricist**: Verified consistency between articles on empirical claims (Lieberman 2008, working memory data, 2024 Neuroscience of Consciousness review).
6. **Buddhist Philosopher**: No new issues.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Self-stultification argument (core strength)
- Tracking puzzle articulation
- Agent causation integration (luck objection connection)
- Access vs phenomenal consciousness distinction
- Contemplative evidence section (added in previous review)
- Length within threshold

### Enhancements Made

1. Fixed broken link to consciousness-as-amplifier article
2. Added bidirectional cross-reference to consciousness-and-intelligence.md

### Cross-links Added

- [consciousness-and-intelligence](/topics/consciousness-and-intelligence/) (in concepts frontmatter)

## Length Management

- **Before**: 2542 words (102% of 2500 soft threshold)
- **After**: 2542 words (102% of 2500 soft threshold)
- **Change**: 0 words (link fix and metadata only)

Operated in length-neutral mode. Changes were structural (link correction, frontmatter addition) with no prose additions.

## Remaining Items

None.

## Stability Notes

- **Article is stable**: This is the fourth deep review. The article's core argument structure is sound.

- **Cross-review verified consistency**: The epiphenomenalism article and consciousness-and-intelligence article use consistent empirical evidence and argumentation. Both cite Lieberman (2008), discuss working memory differences, and reference the 2024 *Neuroscience of Consciousness* review.

- **No oscillation detected**: Changes were targeted fixes (broken link, missing cross-reference) rather than content revisions.

- **Bedrock disagreements unchanged**: MWI proponents, eliminativists, and deflationary physicalists will continue to disagree with the article's framework. These represent philosophical standoffs, not fixable flaws.

- **Convergence achieved**: Article content is stable; future reviews should focus on integration with new content rather than structural changes.
