**Date**: 2026-01-30
**Article**: [Existentialism](/concepts/existentialism/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article is well-constructed with accurate attributions and solid arguments.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Illusionism engagement**: The original text didn't acknowledge Frankish's specific response (cognitive vs. phenomenal illusions).
   - **Resolution applied**: Added acknowledgment of Frankish's position before explaining why it still fails.

2. **Heidegger methodological/ontological distinction**: The claim about being-in-the-world could be read as merely methodological.
   - **Resolution applied**: Clarified that the point is ontological, not just methodological—the explaining itself requires being-in-the-world.

3. **MWI objection framing** (deferred): The article presents the existentialist objection to MWI without engaging with Deutsch's branch-relative response. This is acceptable for a concepts article that links to the dedicated MWI critique.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Dennett's heterophenomenology**: The article's response via Heidegger is implicit but could be more explicit. Deferred as the phenomenology article handles this extensively.
- **Deutsch's branch-relative choice**: Acknowledged as bedrock disagreement. The Map's position is that genuine selection requires singular outcomes.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- The regress argument against illusionism—clear structure building from Sartre through Tallis
- The bad faith analysis as unique evidence for consciousness's irreducibility
- The connection between existentialist freedom and bidirectional interaction tenet
- Well-sourced claims with accurate dates (Being and Nothingness 1943, Being and Time 1927)
- The "What Would Challenge This View?" section with concrete falsification criteria

### Enhancements Made
- Strengthened illusionism rebuttal by acknowledging Frankish's cognitive-illusion response before showing why it fails
- Clarified that being-in-the-world priority is ontological, not merely methodological
- Added mysterianism cross-link to Further Reading

### Cross-links Added
- [mysterianism](/concepts/mysterianism/)

## Remaining Items

None. The article is at 97% of soft threshold, so further expansion would require equivalent trimming.

## Stability Notes

The article represents the Map's interpretation of existentialism for dualist purposes. Key philosophical disagreements that are NOT flaws to fix:

1. **MWI proponents' response**: Deutsch et al. would say branch-relative choice preserves phenomenology of choice. The Map disagrees. This is a bedrock disagreement.

2. **Eliminativist reading of Heidegger**: Dennett and the heterophenomenology tradition would accept Heidegger's descriptions while denying ontological implications. The Map reads Heidegger as providing ontological insight. This interpretive difference is philosophical, not a factual error.

3. **Sartre's own views on dualism**: Sartre himself didn't endorse substance dualism. The article correctly notes this (line 122) while drawing dualist conclusions from his analysis. This is interpretive appropriation, which the Map explicitly practices.

Future reviews should focus on factual accuracy and internal consistency, not on whether adversarial philosophical positions are "adequately answered"—some disagreements are genuine standoffs.
