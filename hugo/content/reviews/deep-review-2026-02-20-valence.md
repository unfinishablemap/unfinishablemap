**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Misattribution (Cutter & Tye 2022)**: The "mental currency" phrase and cited paper ("Consciousness matters: Phenomenal experience has functional value" in *Neuroscience of Consciousness*) are by Cleeremans & Tallon-Baudry, not Cutter & Tye. **Resolution**: Corrected attribution in body text and references.
- **Author order (Barrett & Russell 1999)**: The cited paper has Russell as first author. Article said "Barrett and Russell" in text and "Barrett, L. F., & Russell, J. A." in references. **Resolution**: Corrected to "Russell and Barrett" / "Russell, J. A., & Barrett, L. F." throughout. Also added the full subtitle.
- **Wrong date (Smithies 2021)**: Paper is forthcoming in *Oxford Studies in Philosophy of Mind* Vol. 5, deposited on PhilArchive ~2024, not 2021. **Resolution**: Updated to "Smithies, D. (forthcoming)" with correct publication venue.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Functionalist reinterpretation of asymbolia unaddressed**: A functionalist could argue that asymbolia merely shows which functional subsystem is damaged, not that phenomenal properties do causal work. The original article used asymbolia against epiphenomenalism without engaging this objection. **Resolution**: Added a paragraph in "Valence Does Causal Work" engaging the functionalist objection and explaining why it concedes the dualist point in disguise.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Churchland (eliminative materialist)**: Valence may emerge from brainstem affect programs rather than being irreducible. The article's position is defensible given the hard problem framing—the explanatory gap applies regardless of which neural circuits are involved.
- **Dennett (functionalist)**: Asymbolia shows functional deficit, not phenomenal absence. Now addressed in the article with a rebuttal paragraph.
- **Tegmark (quantum skeptic)**: The quantum connection is speculative. Already appropriately hedged in the article.
- **Nagarjuna (Buddhist)**: Valence as "intrinsic" conflicts with dependent origination accounts of suffering. Minor gap for a concept article; not addressed (would require significant expansion into comparative philosophy).

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent opening paragraph—front-loads the key claim clearly and survives truncation
- Pain asymbolia deployed effectively for two distinct purposes (against evaluativism and against epiphenomenalism)
- "The explanatory gap for valence is particularly stark because the property seems so simple—just positive or negative—yet resists reduction completely"—genuinely insightful observation
- Clean structure following the writing style guide
- Good description field in frontmatter
- Appropriate hedging on the quantum connection

### Enhancements Made
- Added functionalist objection and rebuttal to "Valence Does Causal Work" section
- Added 3 cross-links in Further Reading: [consciousness-and-pain](/topics/consciousness-and-pain/), [suffering-versus-pain](/topics/suffering-versus-pain/), [normative-phenomenology](/concepts/normative-phenomenology/)

### Cross-links Added
- [consciousness-and-pain](/topics/consciousness-and-pain/)
- [suffering-versus-pain](/topics/suffering-versus-pain/)
- [normative-phenomenology](/concepts/normative-phenomenology/)

## Remaining Items

None. All critical issues resolved. Medium issues addressed. The article is well-structured at 1150 words, well below the 2500 soft threshold for concepts.

## Stability Notes

- The six adversarial personas predictably disagree with the article's dualist framing of valence. The eliminative materialist and functionalist challenges are the strongest; the functionalist objection is now explicitly engaged. The materialist alternative (valence as brainstem emergence) is a bedrock disagreement, not a flaw to fix.
- The quantum connection paragraph is appropriately hedged and should not be further expanded or contracted—it strikes the right balance between acknowledging the Map's speculative tenet and not overstating it.
- Pain asymbolia is used for two arguments (anti-evaluativism and anti-epiphenomenalism); future reviews should not flag this dual use as problematic—the two arguments draw on different aspects of asymbolia.
