title: Deep Review - Presentiment and Retrocausality
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-01-27
**Article**: [Presentiment and Retrocausality](/topics/presentiment-and-retrocausality/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Asymmetry justification**: The article accepted physics-based retrocausality for neural selection while rejecting presentiment, but didn't fully explain why the mechanism gap is qualitatively different.
   - **Resolution**: Expanded the "mechanism gap" paragraph to explicitly explain why neural selection plausibly interfaces with quantum measurement while macroscopic physiological responses require a far larger gap to bridge.

2. **Operationalization of "consciousness selects"**: The phrase appeared without criteria for what would count as consciousness selecting vs. neural processes selecting.
   - **Resolution**: Added references to [qualia](/concepts/qualia/) (phenomenal experience), reasoned deliberation, and [agent-causation](/concepts/agent-causation/) (agent-level selection) to clarify what distinguishes conscious selection from automatic organismic response.

### Counterarguments Considered
- Eliminative materialist critique that folk-psychological categories may dissolve: Acknowledged at tenet level, not a flaw in this article
- Quantum skeptic concern about applying quantum physics to neurons: Article already includes mechanism gap acknowledgment; strengthened by explaining why neural vs. physiological gaps differ
- MWI defender perspective: Article reflects Map's rejection of MWI (tenet 4), not a content flaw

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
1. The "Two Distinct Claims" structure—immediately clarifies the article isn't conflating phenomena
2. Fair treatment of contested presentiment literature (both meta-analyses and critiques)
3. The mechanism gap acknowledgment (honest about what's missing)
4. Four-point argument for why the Map doesn't rest on presentiment
5. Bayesian prior probability discussion in "The Current State"
6. Clear "Relation to Site Perspective" connecting to specific tenets
7. Comprehensive references section with primary sources

### Enhancements Made
1. Added "retrocausal variants of hidden-variable theories" to note other interpretations beyond transactional
2. Expanded mechanism gap paragraph to justify asymmetry between neural selection and presentiment
3. Added cross-links to [qualia](/concepts/qualia/) and [agent-causation](/concepts/agent-causation/)
4. Clarified Libet vs. presentiment distinction (internal decision timing vs. external event access)
5. Added new concepts to frontmatter: [qualia](/concepts/qualia/), [agent-causation](/concepts/agent-causation/)

### Cross-links Added
- [qualia](/concepts/qualia/)
- [agent-causation](/concepts/agent-causation/)

## Stability Notes

This article's core claim—that physics-based retrocausality and parapsychological presentiment are independent lines of inquiry—will face continued challenge from two directions:

1. **Physicalists** will argue that if the Map rejects presentiment as implausible, it should reject neural quantum retrocausality for similar reasons. The response (mechanism gap is qualitatively different) is now explicit in the article.

2. **Presentiment researchers** may argue the article unfairly dismisses their field. The article presents both sides fairly and doesn't dismiss presentiment outright—it simply maintains independence between the claims.

Neither of these represents a fixable flaw. They are bedrock disagreements about how to weigh speculative mechanisms.
