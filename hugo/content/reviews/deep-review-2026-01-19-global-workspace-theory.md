title: Deep Review - Global Workspace Theory
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-01-19
**Article**: [Global Workspace Theory](/concepts/global-workspace-theory/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None critical; article already well-structured

### Medium Issues Found
- Missing cross-links to competitor theories (HOT, predictive processing, AST): **Resolved** - Added new "Relation to Competing Theories" section
- Block's overflow argument presented without recent empirical support: **Resolved** - Added Nartker et al. (2025) inattentional blindness research
- No empirical distinguishability section: **Resolved** - Added "Can GWT Be Empirically Distinguished from Dualism?" section

### Counterarguments Considered
- Eliminativist challenge (hard problem may be conceptual confusion): Acknowledged via discussion of methodological impasse
- GWT could be complete if phenomenal consciousness is access consciousness: Addressed in falsifiability section

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent memory systems integration (anoetic/noetic/autonoetic hierarchy)
- Strong COGITATE analysis with appropriate nuance
- Good filter theory reading preserving dualist compatibility
- Clear tenet connections in "Relation to Site Perspective" section

### Enhancements Made
1. **New section**: "Relation to Competing Theories" - HOT, predictive processing, AST comparisons (~400 words)
2. **New section**: "Can GWT Be Empirically Distinguished from Dualism?" - falsifiability analysis (~450 words)
3. **Extended Block argument**: Added Nartker et al. (2025) evidence for consciousness without workspace access
4. **Added cross-links**: attention-as-interface, voluntary-attention, higher-order-theories, predictive-processing, phenomenal-concepts-strategy, metacognition

### Cross-links Added
- [higher-order-theories](/concepts/higher-order-theories/) - Competitor theory comparison
- [predictive-processing](/concepts/predictive-processing/) - Framework integration discussion
- [attention-as-interface](/concepts/attention-as-interface/) - Mind-matter interface connection
- [voluntary-attention](/concepts/voluntary-attention/) - Endogenous attention and workspace access
- [phenomenal-concepts-strategy](/concepts/phenomenal-concepts-strategy/) - Explaining away phenomenal intuitions
- [metacognition](/concepts/metacognition/) - Self-reflective processes

## Remaining Items

None. Article now comprehensively covers:
- Core theory exposition
- Access/phenomenal distinction
- COGITATE empirical results
- Competitor theory relationships
- Memory systems integration
- AI consciousness implications
- Site perspective connections
- Empirical distinguishability analysis
