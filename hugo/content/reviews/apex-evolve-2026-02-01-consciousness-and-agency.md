## Article Reviewed

[Consciousness and Agency](/apex/consciousness-and-agency/)

## Changed Sources Identified

Three sources modified after last synthesis (2026-01-29T08:21:07+00:00):

1. **topics/free-will** (modified 2026-02-01T19:22:00+00:00)
   - Restructured to foreground phenomenological and agent-causal arguments
   - Treats quantum as one illustrative mechanism rather than THE mechanism
   - Added emphasis that philosophical case stands independent of specific physics

2. **concepts/phenomenology-of-choice** (modified 2026-01-31T03:43:00+00:00)
   - Added material on motor selection and parallel architecture with attention
   - Expanded Desmurget dissociation (intention without movement, movement without intention)
   - Added content on causal interface void and retrocausality
   - Strengthened illusionist challenge response

3. **concepts/counterfactual-reasoning** (modified 2026-01-30T04:40:00+00:00)
   - Developed connection between counterfactual reasoning and free will
   - Added that counterfactual reasoning is *how* consciousness engages with options
   - Included LLM challenge case for consciousness-counterfactual connection
   - Working memory connection to deliberation capacity

## Pessimistic Review Findings

### Clarity Critic

- Transition from classical determinism to quantum selection happens quickly without fully establishing agent causation priority
- "Bits per second" bandwidth concept introduced without clear support
- Retrocausal interpretations introduced somewhat abruptly for unfamiliar readers
- Some dense phrases ("genuinely phenomenally engaged selection")

### Redundancy Hunter

- Agent causation explanation appears multiple times with similar content
- Luck objection refutation repeated in different forms
- "Minimal" quantum interaction repeated without adding new information
- Neural signatures (frontal theta, bidirectional coherence) mentioned multiple times

### Narrative Flow Analyst

- Temporal discussion feels like digression before moral responsibility payoff
- Synthesis section comes late; readers may lose thread
- Contemplative evidence buried within luck objection section
- Counterfactual reasoning subsection underdeveloped relative to source material

## Optimistic Review Findings

### Connection Finder

- From free-will: Emphasis on phenomenology and agent causation as primary already present but could be strengthened
- From phenomenology-of-choice: Desmurget dissociation referenced but richer material on selection/execution distinction available
- From counterfactual-reasoning: Major gap—source develops sophisticated account of counterfactual reasoning enabling agent causation; apex only briefly covers

### Synthesis Strengthener

- Counterfactual reasoning should be explicitly identified as *how* consciousness engages with options
- "Selector not generator" could connect to options *evolving* during deliberation
- Temporal framework could link to durée and interpenetrating mental states

### Human Reader Advocate

- Opening strong but could use concrete choice example
- Counterfactual section needs concrete example (sated chimpanzee)
- Synthesis excellent but dense; earlier "what this means" passage would help

## Length Assessment

- **Before**: 3,788 words
- **After**: ~3,800 words (minimal net change)
- **Target range**: 2,500-4,000 words
- **Status**: Within range; no condensation needed

## Summary of Changes Made

1. **Strengthened counterfactual reasoning integration**
   - Expanded subsection to emphasize counterfactual reasoning as *how* consciousness causally engages with options
   - Added that without counterfactual reasoning, selection would be "blind—random rather than reasons-responsive"
   - Included the agent's need to represent, evaluate, and determine among alternatives

2. **Improved Desmurget dissociation reference**
   - Clarified as "double dissociation" showing intention phenomenology is separable from execution machinery
   - Added that consciousness operates at "selection interface, not downstream motor circuits"

3. **Tightened redundant passages**
   - Consolidated neural signature references
   - Removed repetitive explanations of minimal interaction

4. **Updated description**
   - Changed from "Through quantum selection" to "Through agent-causal selection among possibilities physics leaves undetermined"
   - Better reflects emphasis that philosophical case stands independent of specific physics

5. **Updated frontmatter**
