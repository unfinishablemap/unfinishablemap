# Deep Review: Phenomenal Value Realism

**Date**: 2026-01-20
**File**: obsidian/concepts/phenomenal-value-realism.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Missing illusionist engagement**: The article assumed phenomenal consciousness exists without addressing the strongest challenge—illusionism argues phenomenal properties are illusory, which would eliminate phenomenal value realism's referent.
   - **Resolution**: Added comprehensive "The Illusionist Challenge" section with three responses (regress, introspective survival, self-stultifying) plus contemplative challenge.

2. **No falsifiability section**: The site pattern requires "What Would Challenge This View?" sections for deep-reviewed articles.
   - **Resolution**: Added section with five falsifiability conditions.

3. **No explicit "Relation to Site Perspective" section**: The article connected to tenets implicitly but lacked the structured coverage of all five tenets.
   - **Resolution**: Added comprehensive section covering Dualism, Minimal Quantum Interaction, Bidirectional Interaction, No Many Worlds, and Occam's Razor Has Limits.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Missing cross-links**: No links to illusionism.md, introspection.md, witness-consciousness.md, decoherence.md, buddhism-and-dualism.md.
   - **Resolution**: Added all to frontmatter concepts and Further Reading sections.

2. **No process philosophy perspective**: Other deep-reviewed articles include Whitehead's framework; this one didn't.
   - **Resolution**: Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section connecting actual occasions to phenomenal value.

3. **Buddhist objection unaddressed**: Article ignored Buddhist analysis that might question intrinsic value.
   - **Resolution**: Added "The Buddhist Complication" subsection.

4. **No contemplative evidence**: The article lacked phenomenological support from meditation traditions.
   - **Resolution**: Added "Contemplative Evidence" section covering directness of valence, jhāna states, and cessation.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Illusionist challenge**: If phenomenal consciousness is illusory, value grounded in it would have no referent. Addressed with regress argument, introspective survival, and self-stultifying responses.
- **Buddhist emptiness**: If valence lacks intrinsic nature (svabhava), identity claim might fail. Addressed by distinguishing phenomenal presence from metaphysical independence.
- **Open question argument**: Already addressed in original; preserved.
- **Experience machine**: Already addressed in original; preserved.
- **Scope problem**: Already addressed in original; preserved.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Clear articulation of Rawlette's core thesis (pleasure *is* value, not merely correlated)
- Strong distinction from preference satisfaction theories
- Effective "analytic hedonism" framing
- Good connection to indexical identity/haecceity
- Well-structured implications section (AI ethics, animal ethics, meaning of life)
- Clear table of phenomenal value pluralism features
- Helpful "Relation to Other Positions" comparison table

### Enhancements Made

1. Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section with three responses plus contemplative challenge
2. Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section with Whitehead's actual occasions framework
3. Added "The Buddhist Complication" subsection addressing emptiness
4. Added "Contemplative Evidence" section (directness, jhāna states, cessation)
5. Added "What Would Challenge This View?" with five falsifiability conditions
6. Added comprehensive "Relation to Site Perspective" covering all five tenets
7. Expanded Further Reading with illusionism, introspection, witness-consciousness, buddhism-and-dualism
8. Added four new references (Frankish, Dennett, Tallis, Whitehead)
