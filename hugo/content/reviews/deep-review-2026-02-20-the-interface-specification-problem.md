title: Deep Review - The Interface Specification Problem
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-20
**Article**: [The Interface Specification Problem](/topics/the-interface-specification-problem/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Misattribution of "t-shirt problem"**: Article said "what Jonathan Schaffer calls the 't-shirt problem'" but the phrase originates with David Chalmers (1996, p. 214). Schaffer uses the term but credits Chalmers. **Resolution**: Corrected attribution to Chalmers with page reference; Schaffer remains in References as a secondary source.
- **Broken wikilink: `[psychophysical-coupling](/concepts/psychophysical-laws/)`**: No article exists with this slug. **Resolution**: Replaced with `[psychophysical-laws](/concepts/psychophysical-laws/)` (closest existing article) and updated Further Reading description.
- **Broken wikilink: `[interface-locality](/concepts/brain-interface-boundary/)`**: No article exists with this slug. **Resolution**: Removed from concepts frontmatter, replaced body reference with inline text linking to `[pairing-problem](/concepts/pairing-problem/)`, removed from Further Reading.
- **Missing citation for Georgiev**: Monte Carlo simulations discussed by name but not formally cited. **Resolution**: Added full reference: Georgiev, D. (2015). Monte Carlo simulation of quantum Zeno effect in the brain. *International Journal of Modern Physics B*, 29(7), 1550039.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Rajan et al. terminology**: Article described findings as distinguishing "willed from automatic processing" but the paper contrasts "willed vs. instructed" attention. **Resolution**: Changed "automatic" to "instructed."
- **Dense opening paragraph**: Single long sentence covering multiple ideas. **Resolution**: Split into two paragraphs for better front-loading, added connection to Princess Elisabeth's challenge for historical context.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist**: The specification problem is not just unsolved—it's unsolvable because there is nothing to specify. The article's existing "Critic's Strongest Objection" section handles this well with four responses.
- **Empiricist**: The unfalsifiability concern is real. The article honestly acknowledges underdetermination in its own section. No change needed.
- **Quantum skeptic**: Georgiev's challenge to Zeno timescales is noted but could be more prominently featured. Current balance is appropriate—it appears in context with Stapp's response.
- **Many-worlds defender**: The article's section on No Many Worlds correctly notes that specification presupposes collapse. Bedrock disagreement, not a flaw.
- **Buddhist philosopher / Nagarjuna**: The four-question framework assumes subject-object duality and a stable "self" doing the specifying. The article's phenomenological assumptions go unexamined. This is a valid philosophical point but beyond scope for a topics-level article.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- The four-question specification framework (mental variables, physical parameters, transfer function, boundary conditions) is excellent original structuring that provides genuine analytical value
- The honest self-assessment using the "pre-Newtonian phase" analogy is distinctive and credible—avoids overclaiming
- Relation to Site Perspective connects each tenet specifically and substantively
- "What Would Count as Progress?" section transforms a weakness into a research program
- Clean, confident prose that avoids LLM clichés throughout

### Enhancements Made
- Added early cross-reference to Princess Elisabeth's challenge, establishing historical depth
- Added `[valence](/concepts/valence/)` wikilink for the valence → action selection candidate
- Added Chalmers (1996) to References for proper attribution
- Added Georgiev (2015) to References for completeness
- Split dense opening for better truncation resilience

### Cross-links Added
- [princess-elizabeths-challenge](/topics/princess-elizabeths-challenge/) (early in opening, contextualizing the problem historically)
- [valence](/concepts/valence/) (in the unspecified candidates section)
- [pairing-problem](/concepts/pairing-problem/) (replacing broken interface-locality link)

## Remaining Items

None. All critical and medium issues addressed.

## Stability Notes

- The six adversarial personas will always find this article philosophically unsatisfying—it openly acknowledges the specification problem as the Map's biggest open challenge. This honesty is a feature, not a bug. Future reviews should not flag "the specification problem hasn't been solved" as a critical issue.
- The eliminative materialist's strongest move (premise 3: difficulty of specification is best explained by nothing to specify) is a bedrock disagreement. The article's four responses are adequate; strengthening them further risks over-arguing.
- The underdetermination between Stapp and Eccles models is a genuine open question that the article correctly presents as such, not something to be resolved by editorial choice.
