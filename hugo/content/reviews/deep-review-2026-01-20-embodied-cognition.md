# Deep Review: Embodied Cognition and the Extended Mind

**Date**: 2026-01-20
**File**: obsidian/concepts/embodied-cognition.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
1. **No engagement with illusionism**: the site has a major article on illusionism, and embodied cognition needed to address how illusionists explain skill acquisition and choking.
   - **Resolution**: Added "The Illusionist Challenge" subsection after the choking evidence, engaging Dennett/Frankish with a detailed response showing why phenomenological distinctions matter.

2. **Missing falsifiability section**: No discussion of what would challenge the compatibility claim.
   - **Resolution**: Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section with five testable conditions.

3. **Missing Whitehead/process philosophy**: Other recent deep reviews have added this perspective systematically; this article lacked it.
   - **Resolution**: Added "Process Philosophy and Embodied Cognition" section connecting Whitehead's actual occasions to Merleau-Ponty's lived body.

### Medium Issues Found
4. **Missing cross-links to related content**: brain-specialness.md, interface-locality.md, substrate-independence-critique.md, attention-as-interface.md, motor-selection.md, decoherence.md, witness-consciousness.md, voluntary-attention.md were all relevant but not linked.
   - **Resolution**: Added 9 new entries to Further Reading section and 5 new concepts to frontmatter.

5. **Tenet coverage incomplete**: Minimal Quantum Interaction and No Many Worlds were dismissed as "neutral."
   - **Resolution**: Substantially expanded both tenet sections, connecting quantum Zeno mechanism to the Dreyfus model's attention modes and arguing that choking evidence supports genuine selection against MWI.

6. **Citation gaps**: Baumeister and Beilock research on choking lacked full citations.
   - **Resolution**: Added full citations for Baumeister (1984) and Beilock & Carr (2001), plus Dreyfus (1992), Dennett (1991), Frankish (2016), and Whitehead (1929).

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Illusionist reading of choking**: The claim that choking is brain-state-interfering-with-brain-state without phenomenal consciousness. Response argues that the distinction between absorbed and self-monitoring attention tracks phenomenological categories that must be explained.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent framing of how embodied cognition challenges substance dualism but not property dualism
- The choking under pressure section provides unique and compelling evidence for bidirectional interaction
- Clear and accessible explanation of 4E cognition
- Good treatment of enactivism through Thompson and Varela
- The Dreyfus skill acquisition model is well-explained with the consciousness modes table
- The compatibility with filter theory section effectively reframes the debate

### Enhancements Made
1. Added illusionism engagement section with substantive philosophical response
2. Added process philosophy section connecting Whitehead to Merleau-Ponty
3. Added falsifiability section with five testable conditions
4. Substantially expanded Minimal Quantum Interaction and No Many Worlds tenet connections
5. Added 6 new references to the References section
