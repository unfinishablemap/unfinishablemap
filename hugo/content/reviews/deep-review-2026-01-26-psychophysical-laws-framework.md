title: Deep Review - The Psychophysical Laws Framework
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-01-26
**Article**: [The Psychophysical Laws Framework](/topics/psychophysical-laws-framework/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Six adversarial personas evaluated the article:

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article has all required sections, no factual errors detected, and no internal contradictions.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Decoherence section balance**: The Tegmark vs. Hameroff dispute was presented as more resolved than it is. Resolution: Added language acknowledging mainstream physics consensus while noting the debate is ongoing.
2. **Missing falsifiability criteria**: No "What Would Challenge This View?" section. Resolution: Added comprehensive section with five falsifiability conditions.
3. **Piecemeal progress claim lacked specifics**: The specification problem response mentioned testable predictions without demonstrating them. Resolution: Left as-is since companion articles (psychophysical-coupling-mechanisms) address this in detail.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminativist challenge** (Churchland): Article presupposes hard problem is genuine. Response: This is a philosophical commitment per the Map's tenets, not a flaw.
- **Empiricist challenge** (Popper): Framework must be testable. Response: Added explicit falsifiability section.
- **MWI challenge** (Deutsch): Many-worlds would eliminate selection laws. Response: Article already addresses this; it's a tenet-level commitment.
- **Buddhist challenge** (Nagarjuna): Framework assumes substantial self. Response: This is an alternative metaphysical framework; noted in stability section below.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

Six sympathetic personas evaluated the article:

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear upward-downward asymmetry framing distinguishes Chalmers' work from Map's extension
- Honest acknowledgment of challenges (decoherence, specification problem)
- Consistent mechanism evaluation structure (phenomenal variable, physical variable, mechanism, challenge)
- Strong "Relation to Site Perspective" section connecting all five tenets
- Front-loaded opening summary stating core thesis clearly
- Appropriate balance between presenting Chalmers and extending to bidirectional causation

### Enhancements Made
1. **Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section**: Five falsifiability conditions covering hard problem dissolution, quantum mechanism unavailability, MWI confirmation, specification impossibility, and phenomenological contradiction.
2. **Strengthened decoherence discussion**: More balanced presentation acknowledging mainstream consensus while noting ongoing debate.
3. **Enhanced bandwidth constraint discussion**: Developed the ~10 bits/second limit as positive evidence for the framework rather than just a constraint.
4. **Added mysterianism cross-link**: Connected cognitive closure response to the mysterianism concept page.
5. **Added reference to companion concept page**: Pointed readers to psychophysical-laws.md for deeper Chalmers coverage.

### Cross-links Added
- [mysterianism](/concepts/mysterianism/) (for cognitive closure discussion)
- [psychophysical-laws](/concepts/psychophysical-laws/) (companion concept page reference in opening)

## Remaining Items

None. All medium-priority issues were addressed.

## Stability Notes

The following represent fundamental philosophical disagreements rather than fixable problems:

- **Eliminativist critique**: The article assumes the hard problem is genuine. This is a Map tenet, not a flaw. Future reviews should not re-flag this.
- **MWI proponent critique**: The rejection of many-worlds is central to the Map's framework. This is a tenet-level commitment.
- **Buddhist/process critique**: The article treats consciousness as a substance with causal powers. Alternative frameworks (dependent arising, actual occasions) are valid philosophical options but the Map's framework is internally consistent on its own terms.
