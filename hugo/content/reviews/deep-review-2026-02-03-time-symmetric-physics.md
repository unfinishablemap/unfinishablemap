title: Deep Review - Time-Symmetric Physics
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Article**: [Time-Symmetric Physics](/concepts/time-symmetric-physics/)
**Previous review**: [2026-02-02](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-02-time-symmetric-physics/)
**Context**: Cross-review considering presentiment-and-retrocausality article

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article remains internally consistent and correctly attributed.

### Medium Issues Found
None remaining. Issues from the 2026-02-02 review were resolved:
- Decoherence response was expanded to address femtosecond timescale objection
- Mathematical vs. causal symmetry distinction was added to Price's Argument section

### Cross-Review Findings
Examined time-symmetric-physics.md in light of the presentiment-and-retrocausality article:

- **No vulnerabilities exposed**: The presentiment article explicitly relies on this article's physics foundations ("The transactional interpretation doesn't require presentiment. Wheeler's delayed-choice is experimentally confirmed. Time-symmetric quantum mechanics is mathematically sound.")
- **Distinction is sound**: The time-symmetric-physics article appropriately focuses on physics without making claims about contested parapsychological phenomena
- **One connection missing**: No cross-link existed from time-symmetric-physics to presentiment-and-retrocausality, leaving the physics/parapsychology distinction undiscoverable from the physics side

### Counterarguments Considered
All counterarguments from previous review remain addressed:
1. Mathematical symmetry ≠ causal symmetry: Price's response included
2. Femtosecond decoherence: Clarification that time-symmetric theories don't require sustained coherence included
3. Unfalsifiability: Honest acknowledgment that indistinguishability cuts both ways included

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent opening summary front-loading key claim and relevance to the Map
- Comprehensive T-symmetry coverage across classical, EM, QM, and gravity
- Multiple time-symmetric interpretations (transactional, TSVF, Price) well-explained
- Strong Libet resolution section connecting to consciousness
- Clear tenet connections in "Relation to Site Perspective"
- Appropriate epistemic humility throughout

### Enhancements Made
- Added cross-link to [presentiment-and-retrocausality](/topics/presentiment-and-retrocausality/) in Further Reading section

### Cross-links Added
- [presentiment-and-retrocausality](/topics/presentiment-and-retrocausality/) — Distinguishing physics-based retrocausality from contested parapsychological claims

## Remaining Items

None. The article has reached stability after two reviews. The cross-review with the presentiment article confirmed the physics foundations are sound and the new cross-link completes the bidirectional connection.

## Stability Notes

This article represents a stable treatment of time-symmetric physics. The previous review noted fundamental philosophical disagreements that are not flaws:
- Eliminative materialists will always object to any role for consciousness in physics
- Many-worlds defenders will prefer MWI's avoidance of collapse
- Strict empiricists will object to interpretation being unfalsifiable

The cross-review with presentiment-and-retrocausality confirms that:
- The physics-based retrocausality presented here stands independently of contested parapsychological claims
- The presentiment article correctly relies on this article's physics without conflating the two evidence streams
- Future reviews should NOT re-flag the philosophical disagreements above as critical issues
