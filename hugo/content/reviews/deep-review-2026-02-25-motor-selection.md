title: Deep Review - Motor Selection and the Attention-Motor Interface
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-25
**Article**: [Motor Selection and the Attention-Motor Interface](/concepts/motor-selection/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-26](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-26-motor-selection/)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Broken link `[voluntary-attention](/concepts/attention-as-interface/)`**: Slug does not exist; the file was renamed to `voluntary-attention-control-mechanisms`. Appeared in frontmatter concepts, body text, and Further Reading (3 occurrences). Resolution: Updated all three to `[voluntary-attention-control-mechanisms](/concepts/voluntary-attention-control-mechanisms/)`.

2. **Broken link `[psychophysical-coupling-mechanisms](/concepts/psychophysical-laws/)`**: Article was archived, superseded by `[psychophysical-laws](/concepts/psychophysical-laws/)`. Resolution: Updated link target.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **False dichotomy in "Why Neural Competition Doesn't Suffice"**
   - Finding: The argument presented only two options—deterministic or "something beyond neural dynamics must resolve." The strongest physicalist objection (stochastic resolution biased by reward history suffices without a conscious selector) was not addressed.
   - Resolution: Added explicit engagement with the stochastic option, arguing it reduces choice to "weighted randomness" rather than genuine decision.

2. **Hameroff coherence claim presented as correction**
   - Finding: "Corrected calculations for biological conditions (Hameroff 2014)" implied these were accepted corrections rather than disputed estimates. Removed unsupported "roughly 1000 quantum cycles" claim.
   - Resolution: Reframed as "Hameroff (2014) calculates..." with explicit note that "these figures remain disputed."

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Dennett's stochastic sufficiency argument**: Now explicitly addressed — stochastic resolution is weighted randomness, not genuine choice
- **Tegmark's decoherence challenge**: Hameroff's response now properly qualified as disputed rather than accepted
- **MWI defense**: Bedrock disagreement from previous review; not re-flagged
- **Eliminativist challenge**: Addressed via illusionist section (preserved from prior reviews)

### Attribution Accuracy

All attributions verified clean:
- Rizzolatti PMTA properly credited with explicit Map/source separation (line 59)
- Cisek, Thura, Palmiter, Berridge, Schurger, Sjöberg, Desmurget, Stapp all properly attributed
- No misattribution, dropped qualifiers, or source/Map conflation found

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Excellent front-loaded summary covering the full argument in two paragraphs
- Strong source/Map separation (Rizzolatti disclaimer)
- Double dissociation evidence (Desmurget) powerfully deployed
- "Honest Gap" section admirably forthright about framework limitations
- Comprehensive tenet connections (all five addressed substantively)
- Three-layer model (computation → dopamine → consciousness) clear and compelling
- Capacity/initiation dissociation argument (Palmiter's mice, Parkinson's) strong

### Enhancements Made

1. Addressed the stochastic-resolution physicalist objection explicitly
2. Properly qualified Hameroff's disputed coherence time estimates
3. Fixed two broken wikilinks (voluntary-attention, psychophysical-coupling-mechanisms)
4. Tightened prose throughout for length neutrality (-84 words net)

### Cross-links Updated

- `[voluntary-attention](/concepts/attention-as-interface/)` → `[voluntary-attention-control-mechanisms](/concepts/voluntary-attention-control-mechanisms/)` (3 occurrences)
- `[psychophysical-coupling-mechanisms](/concepts/psychophysical-laws/)` → `[psychophysical-laws](/concepts/psychophysical-laws/)` (1 occurrence)

## Word Count Change

- Before: 3115 words (125% of 2500 soft threshold)
- After: 3031 words (121% of 2500 soft threshold)
- Net reduction: -84 words

## Remaining Items

None requiring immediate follow-up. Article remains above soft threshold but within acceptable range for a coalesced piece integrating three former articles.

## Stability Notes

This is the third review of this article (2026-01-21, 2026-01-26, 2026-02-25). The article was coalesced on 2026-02-15 from motor-selection + attention-motor-quantum-interface + dopamine-selection-interface, which triggered this review cycle. Changes were targeted: link fixes, one argument strengthened, one claim better qualified, prose tightened.

Bedrock philosophical disagreements (stable from prior reviews):
- **MWI proponents** will find the "No Many Worlds" argument unsatisfying — expected philosophical standoff
- **Decoherence skeptics** will question quantum effects in warm neural tissue — the Map acknowledges speculative mechanism status
- **Eliminativists** will deny the explanatory need for non-physical selection — fundamental worldview difference
- **Stochastic sufficiency advocates** will resist the distinction between weighted randomness and genuine choice — now explicitly engaged rather than ignored

These represent stable disagreements, not fixable flaws. Future reviews should not re-flag them as critical issues.
