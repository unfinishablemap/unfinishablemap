**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None. No factual errors, misattributions, internal contradictions, or missing required sections.

### Medium Issues Found
- **M1 (Dennett engagement too thin)**: Article dismissed intentional stance without acknowledging Dennett's heterophenomenological response. *Resolution*: Added explicit engagement with heterophenomenology and explained why the Map holds it fails via the hard problem.
- **M2 (Phantom "literature" category)**: "The phenomenology-of-choice literature" implied a named academic field. *Resolution*: Reworded to "The phenomenology of choice" with natural link.
- **M3 (Orphaned Chisholm citation)**: Chisholm 1964 in References with no body anchor. *Resolution*: Added parenthetical annotation to the reference explaining its relevance.
- **M5 (Argument from reason too compressed)**: One-sentence treatment carried too much weight. *Resolution*: Added parenthetical pointing to full treatment in linked article.
- **M6 (Teleofunctionalism gap)**: No mention of Millikan-style teleofunctionalism as primary physicalist alternative. *Resolution*: Added Millikan's position alongside Dennett's in the physicalism section, added Millikan 1984 to References.
- **M7 (No falsifiability section)**: Unlike agent-causation, no "What Would Challenge This View?" section. *Resolution*: Added four-bullet falsifiability section.
- **M8 (Style guide violation)**: "This is not progressive evolution" used prohibited "This is not X" pattern. *Resolution*: Reworded to make positive claim directly.
- **L5 ("magical thinking" colloquial)**: Replaced with "unconstrained teleological speculation."
- **L6 (Orphaned Kim citation)**: Added parenthetical annotation to Kim reference.
- **L7 (Imprecise MWI characterisation)**: Changed "every possible outcome occurs" to "every physically possible quantum outcome actualises in some branch."

### Counterarguments Considered
- Dennett's heterophenomenology / illusionism: Now explicitly acknowledged and responded to.
- Teleofunctionalism (Millikan): Now named as distinct from intentional stance.
- Reliabilist epistemology on argument from reason: Pointed to full treatment in linked article.
- Nagarjuna's challenge to the purposing self: Noted as low priority; agent teleology's commitment to robust selfhood is acknowledged via the mysterianism/cognitive closure addition.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Three-type taxonomy (cosmic / design / agent) — the article's clearest original contribution
- "Local and emergent" framing — distinctive and defensible
- Gazelle example — concrete, philosophically pointed, memorable
- "Something it is like to want to survive" — elegantly Nagelian
- "What Agent Teleology Does Not Claim" section — effective inoculation against inflated readings
- Evolution section's core argument: evolution eliminated cosmic teleology without eliminating agent teleology

### Enhancements Made
- Expanded phenomenology section with three experiential features: directedness, ownership, normativity
- Added cross-link to phenomenology-of-agency-vs-passivity for the active/passive contrast
- Connected purpose to phenomenal normativity — the experience of value built into conscious states
- Added reasons-responsiveness as the conceptual bridge distinguishing genuine purpose from functional tracking
- Added phenomenal intentionality as the feature physicalism cannot accommodate
- Improved Whitehead/subjective-aim treatment: replaced "directed toward its own completion" with more accurate "directed toward its own satisfaction" and noted the dynamic process character
- Added process-philosophy link alongside Whitehead material
- Added mysterianism/cognitive closure point to "What Agent Teleology Does Not Claim" — the mechanism may exceed comprehension while the phenomenal fact does not
- Added consciousness-and-agency apex article to Further Reading
- Anchored orphaned references (Chisholm, Kim) with parenthetical annotations

### Cross-links Added
- [phenomenal-intentionality](/concepts/intentionality/) — purposes as intentional states with phenomenal content
- [reasons-responsiveness](/concepts/reasons-responsiveness/) — distinguishing genuine purpose from functional tracking
- [phenomenal-normativity](/concepts/phenomenal-normativity/) — normative dimension of purposive experience
- [mysterianism](/concepts/mysterianism/) — cognitive closure on the mechanism
- [process-philosophy](/concepts/process-philosophy/) — broader tradition informing the Whitehead material
- [phenomenology-of-agency-vs-passivity](/topics/phenomenology-of-agency-vs-passivity/) — the active/passive phenomenological contrast
- [consciousness-and-agency](/apex/consciousness-and-agency/) — apex synthesis (added to Further Reading)
- [hard-problem-of-consciousness](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/) — responding to Dennett's heterophenomenology
- [causal-interface](/voids/causal-interface/) — the opacity of the purpose-to-physics mechanism

## Remaining Items

- **Teleofunctionalism engagement could be deeper**: The Millikan mention is brief. A future review could expand if the article grows toward the soft threshold.
- **Kane's self-forming actions not mentioned**: The optimistic review identified SFAs as relevant to diachronic purposiveness. Deferred to avoid over-expanding the article in a single review.
- **Buddhist/Nagarjuna challenge unaddressed**: The article assumes a robust self doing the purposing. This is a legitimate philosophical tension but not a flaw in a dualist concept article — noted for awareness.

## Stability Notes

The six adversarial personas are designed to disagree with dualist content. Key bedrock disagreements that future reviews should NOT re-flag:
- Dennett's intentional stance: The article now explicitly acknowledges and responds to heterophenomenology. The disagreement is fundamental (hard problem), not a fixable flaw.
- Teleofunctionalism: Now named and distinguished. The Map's response presupposes phenomenal consciousness is irreducible — this is a tenet commitment, not an oversight.
- Many Worlds: The No Many Worlds tenet is a starting commitment. MWI defenders will always find this unsatisfying.
- Nagarjuna's no-self: Agent teleology requires a robust self. This is a feature of the position, not a bug.
