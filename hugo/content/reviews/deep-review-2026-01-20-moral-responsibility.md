# Deep Review: Moral Responsibility

**Date**: 2026-01-20
**File**: obsidian/concepts/moral-responsibility.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Missing Illusionist Challenge section**: The article lacked engagement with Dennett and Frankish's illusionism, which directly challenges the phenomenological grounding of desert. **Resolution**: Added comprehensive "The Illusionist Challenge" section with three responses (regress, self-stultification, performative contradiction) plus contemplative evidence.

2. **Missing Decoherence Challenge section**: No engagement with quantum decoherence objection despite relying on quantum Zeno mechanism. **Resolution**: Added "The Decoherence Challenge" section with three responses (disputed calculations, biological quantum effects, Zeno doesn't require sustained coherence).

3. **Missing "What Would Challenge This View?" section**: Lacked falsifiability conditions that have become standard in reviewed articles. **Resolution**: Added section with five falsifiability conditions.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Thin tenet connections**: Original "Relation to Site Tenets" section was brief and missed connections to decoherence, illusionism, and haecceity. **Resolution**: Expanded each of the five tenet connections to include these challenges and cross-references.

2. **Missing Process Philosophy perspective**: Other reviewed articles consistently include Whitehead's actual occasions framework. **Resolution**: Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section connecting concrescence, creativity, and character to desert.

3. **No Buddhist engagement**: Article discussed moral responsibility without addressing Buddhist ethics' maintenance of responsibility without permanent selfhood. **Resolution**: Added Buddhist objection to "Objections and Responses" section.

### Counterarguments Considered

- Illusionist challenge to effort phenomenology as evidence for desert
- Decoherence objection to quantum mechanism
- Buddhist no-self challenge to agent causation
- Compatibilist sufficiency argument

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Clear articulation of sourcehood requirement and how agent causation satisfies it
- Effective contrastive table (Lucky vs Consciousness-Selected Indeterminism)
- Strong treatment of character responsibility through self-creation
- Good integration of quantum Zeno mechanism with moral agency
- Solid practical implications section (criminal justice, moral education)
- Phenomenology of effort section effectively links experience to causal engagement

### Enhancements Made

1. **Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section** (4 subsections): Challenge statement, three responses (regress, self-stultification, performative contradiction), contemplative challenge
2. **Added "The Decoherence Challenge" section** (2 subsections): Why it matters for desert, three responses
3. **Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section** (2 subsections): Actual occasions and decision, why process philosophy strengthens the case
4. **Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section**: Five falsifiability conditions
5. **Expanded "Relation to Site Perspective"**: All five tenets now include cross-references to illusionism, decoherence, haecceity, and quantum-biology
6. **Added Buddhist engagement** to Objections section
7. **Strengthened objection responses** with Whitehead and introspection cross-references

### Cross-links Added

- [introspection](/concepts/introspection/) - for contemplative evidence and objection responses
- [decoherence](/concepts/decoherence/) - for Decoherence Challenge section
- [haecceity](/concepts/haecceity/) - for No Many Worlds tenet connection
- [witness-consciousness](/concepts/witness-consciousness/) - for contemplative challenge to illusionism
- [buddhism-and-dualism](/concepts/buddhism-and-dualism/) - for Buddhist objection
- [mysterianism](/concepts/mysterianism/) - for Occam's Razor connection
- [quantum-biology](/concepts/quantum-biology/) - for biological quantum effects
- [measurement-problem](/concepts/measurement-problem/) - for decoherence doesn't solve measurement problem point

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues have been addressed. The article now follows the standard template structure used across other deep-reviewed concept pages, including engagement with illusionism, decoherence, process philosophy, and falsifiability conditions.
