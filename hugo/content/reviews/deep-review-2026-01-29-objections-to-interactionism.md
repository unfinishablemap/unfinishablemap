title: Deep Review - Objections to Interactionist Dualism
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-01-29
**Article**: [Objections To Interactionism](/concepts/objections-to-interactionism/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-20](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-20-objections-to-interactionism/)
**Context**: Cross-review considering delegatory-dualism.md

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The previous review (2026-01-20) addressed major gaps including the decoherence objection and falsifiability conditions.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing delegatory dualism cross-reference**: The exclusion argument section lacked reference to Bradford Saad's delegatory dualism (2025), which provides a distinct response to the exclusion problem via preemption rather than quantum insufficiency.
  - **Resolution**: Added new "Response 4: Delegatory Preemption" subsection explaining the delegation mechanism and observational closure distinction.

- **Observational closure unmentioned**: The falsifiability section didn't note the observational vs. universal closure distinction, which strengthens the empirical testability discussion.
  - **Resolution**: Mentioned in the new delegatory preemption section; linked to falsifiability discussion.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Dennett/functionalist**: Response to parsimony could engage functionalist accounts more directly. Left as-is since the hard problem response is substantive.
- **Eliminativist**: Article assumes consciousness exists as described. Not addressed (outside Map's framework).
- **MWI**: Many-Worlds challenge acknowledged in falsifiability section; bedrock disagreement per site tenets.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear summary table structure (now enhanced with delegatory dualism reference)
- Strong conservation laws treatment (Pitts/Cucu, selection-not-injection)
- Parsimony response (consciousness as datum)
- Evolutionary argument as supporting interactionism
- Luck objection connection in exclusion section
- Falsifiability conditions from previous review

### Enhancements Made
1. Added "Response 4: Delegatory Preemption" to exclusion argument section (~150 words)
2. Added `[delegatory-dualism](/topics/delegatory-dualism/)` to frontmatter concepts
3. Updated summary table to mention delegatory preemption
4. Added delegatory-dualism to Further Reading
5. Updated Relation to Site Perspective to mention both quantum and delegation responses
6. Tightened several sections to maintain length neutrality (drainage problem, interventionism, levels/proportionality, non-computational selection)

### Cross-links Added
- [delegatory-dualism](/topics/delegatory-dualism/) — new section and multiple references
- Updated exclusion argument table entry

## Word Count

- Before: 3406 words (136% of 2500 soft threshold)
- After: 3465 words (139% of 2500 soft threshold)
- Net change: +59 words

Length-neutral mode applied: additions balanced against trimming of verbose passages.

## Remaining Items

None. Cross-review with delegatory-dualism.md completed successfully.

## Stability Notes

This is the second deep review of this article. The previous review (2026-01-20) made substantial additions (decoherence section, falsifiability). This review makes targeted cross-linking additions to integrate new site content (delegatory dualism).

The article has reached stability on its core content. Future reviews should focus on:
- Integration of any new site content relevant to objections
- No further expansion needed unless new philosophical literature emerges

The adversarial personas' disagreements (eliminativism, MWI, Buddhist emptiness) represent bedrock philosophical disagreements, not article flaws. These should not be re-flagged in future reviews.
