title: Deep Review - Dualism
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-01-19
**Article**: [Dualism](/concepts/dualism/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Unsupported Chalmers claim**: The article claimed "David Chalmers has expressed preference for substance dualism because it better handles personal identity—the persisting subject is the consciousness itself." Research confirmed Chalmers 2016 does express preference for substance dualism (cited in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy), but the specific "personal identity" reasoning was not verified. The 2016 paper addresses the *subject combination problem* (how micro-subjects combine into macro-subjects), which is related but distinct from personal identity over time.
  - **Resolution**: Corrected to accurately reflect Chalmers' documented reasoning about the subject combination problem, with proper citation to Chalmers 2016.

### Medium Issues Found
- The arguments section presents the four convergent arguments without noting main counterarguments (Mary's acquaintance objection, zombie conceivability disputes)
  - **Deferred**: The article structure appropriately points to detailed treatment in linked articles; adding counterarguments here would unbalance the overview

- Missing Chalmers 2016 citation in References
  - **Resolution**: Added proper citation

### Counterarguments Considered
- Eliminativist challenge: The hard problem framing is contested, not universally accepted
- Physicalist response to knowledge argument: Mary gains acquaintance, not propositional knowledge
- Zombie conceivability: Many argue zombies are not genuinely conceivable
- Decoherence objections to quantum interaction: Not addressed in this article but covered in linked articles

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent front-loaded opening summary stating core claims immediately
- Clear articulation of the ontological (not merely epistemic) nature of dualism's claims
- Effective "convergence" framing—multiple independent arguments reaching the same conclusion
- Good balance between substance and property dualism without forcing an arbitrary choice
- Appropriate cross-linking to related articles for detailed treatment
- Strong "Relation to Site Perspective" section connecting to tenets

### Enhancements Made
- Corrected Chalmers substance dualism claim to reflect documented reasoning (subject combination problem)
- Added Chalmers 2016 citation to References section
- Updated `last_deep_review` timestamp
- Also corrected the same claim in substance-property-dualism.md for consistency

### Cross-links Added
- No new cross-links needed; existing cross-linking is comprehensive

## Remaining Items

- The article could benefit from brief mention of main counterarguments to the four convergent arguments, but this would change the article's character as an overview. The current structure appropriately defers detailed objection/response treatment to linked articles.

- Consider future cross-review with personal-identity.md to explore the relationship between dualism and personal identity more carefully, now that the Chalmers claim has been corrected.
