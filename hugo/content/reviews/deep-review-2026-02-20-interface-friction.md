title: Deep Review - Interface Friction
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-20
**Article**: [Interface Friction](/concepts/interface-friction/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Internal tension between bandwidth and quantum Zeno rates**: Article claimed ~10 bps consciousness bandwidth while implicitly requiring quantum Zeno observations at rates many orders of magnitude faster. Resolution: Added a paragraph explicitly acknowledging this tension and proposing that Zeno-sustaining observations need not be individually conscious — consciousness sets the target pattern at low bandwidth while a sub-personal coupling mechanism handles high-frequency observations.
- **Missing No Many Worlds tenet**: Relation to Site Perspective covered four of five tenets but omitted No Many Worlds, despite the article's extensive discussion of quantum selection and decoherence. Resolution: Added full No Many Worlds paragraph explaining that friction depends on genuine single-outcome selection.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Uncited "10 bits per second" claim**: Presented as settled fact without source. Resolution: Added citations (Zimmermann 1986; Norretranders 1998), widened range to "10–50 bits per second" to acknowledge methodological variation.
- **Uncited psychedelic research claim**: DMN suppression and enriched phenomenology presented without citation. Resolution: Added Carhart-Harris et al. 2012 citation and acknowledged mixed evidence (psychedelics also impair task performance and narrative coherence).
- **Uncited quantum Zeno interpretation**: Resolution: Added Stapp 2001 and Schwartz et al. 2005 citations.
- **Weak engagement with physicalist alternative**: Dismissed physicalist account in one sentence without argument. Resolution: Rewrote to specify what the filter framework adds — a structural answer to why constraints exhibit their specific pattern (systematic, effort-responsive, asymmetric).
- **"Not X. It is Y." pattern**: Opening paragraph used "friction is not a defect. It is diagnostic" — flagged as LLM cliché in the writing style guide. Resolution: Condensed to "friction is diagnostic" and expanded with the substantive claim about what pattern friction predicts.
- **Broken wikilinks**: `psychophysical-coupling` and `causal-interface` don't exist as concept files. Deferred — these are future article candidates, not broken references.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Explanatory gap challenge** (Is friction just relabeling known cognitive phenomena?): Addressed in revised opening paragraph — friction predicts a distinctive pattern (systematic, effort-responsive, cross-domain-structured) that physicalist redescription does not.
- **Quantum Zeno rate problem**: Addressed directly in new paragraph in Attentional Cost section.
- **Falsifiability concern**: Partially addressed by specifying what friction predicts (systematic pattern, filter-model predictions for psychedelics). Full falsifiability discussion deferred — better suited to a dedicated article on the framework's empirical commitments.
- **Selective use of psychedelic evidence**: Addressed by acknowledging mixed evidence and integrating the mixed results into the filter interpretation (loosened filter = wider aperture but less precision).

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Four-source taxonomy (bandwidth, decoherence, coupling imprecision, attentional cost) — clear and operating at distinct explanatory levels
- Tool-and-material diagnostic analogy in the opening
- Phenomenological grounding (tip-of-tongue, motor overshoot, concentration strain)
- "What Flows Easily / What Resists / Pathological Friction" diagnostic structure
- Speculative clinical interpretations appropriately flagged
- "Friction is the price of minimality" formulation for Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet
- Filter theory connection and psychedelic research touchpoint

### Enhancements Made
- Added References section with five citations (Carhart-Harris, Norretranders, Schwartz et al., Stapp, Zimmermann)
- Added No Many Worlds tenet engagement
- Resolved bandwidth/quantum-Zeno tension with explicit paragraph
- Strengthened filter model section with argument for what it adds beyond redescription
- Acknowledged mixed psychedelic evidence with filter-based interpretation
- Widened bandwidth figure to "10–50 bits per second" with citation and uncertainty range

### Cross-links Added
- No new cross-links added (existing link coverage is comprehensive)

## Remaining Items

- **Concept files to create**: `psychophysical-coupling` and `causal-interface` are referenced but don't exist. These should be created as standalone concept articles.
- **Developmental dimension**: The observation that friction changes over a lifetime (skill acquisition as channel-building, aging as channel degradation) could be expanded in a future revision.
- **Free will connection**: The framework naturally addresses the "effort of willing" problem and could explicitly connect to the luck objection against libertarian free will. Deferred to avoid overexpanding.
- **Epistemic friction**: Brain-to-consciousness friction (opacity of introspection, inability to observe coupling mechanism) is noted in the tenet section but could be developed into its own body section.

## Stability Notes

- The six adversarial personas predictably disagreed with the dualist framework. These are bedrock philosophical disagreements, not fixable problems. Future reviews should NOT re-flag "materialists find this unconvincing" or "MWI proponents object to collapse" as critical issues.
- The quantum Zeno rate tension has been explicitly acknowledged and a resolution proposed. Future reviews should evaluate whether the proposed resolution (sub-personal observations, conscious target-setting) is satisfactory, not re-flag the tension itself.
- The psychedelic evidence is now presented as mixed. Future reviews should not oscillate between "needs more psychedelic support" and "psychedelic evidence is cherry-picked" — the current balanced treatment is stable.
