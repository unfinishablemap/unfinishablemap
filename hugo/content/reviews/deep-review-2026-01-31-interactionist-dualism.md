title: Deep Review - Interactionist Dualism
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Article**: [Interactionist Dualism](/archive/arguments/interactionist-dualism/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-29](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-29-interactionist-dualism/)
**Review type**: Cross-review with causal-interface.md

## Context

This review was triggered as a cross-review following the creation of `obsidian/voids/causal-interface.md`. The purpose is to ensure the interactionist-dualism concept page properly acknowledges and integrates with the causal interface void—which addresses why we cannot observe how consciousness causes anything.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Six adversarial philosopher personas examined the document:

### Critical Issues Found
**None.** The previous reviews (2026-01-19, 2026-01-25, 2026-01-29) addressed all critical issues. No new critical issues emerged.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing cross-reference to causal-interface void**: The new causal-interface.md void article directly addresses why the interface between consciousness and physics is systematically invisible. The agent-causation.md article now references this void. The interactionist-dualism article discussed the quantum mechanism without acknowledging this epistemological limitation.
  - **Resolution**: Added causal-interface cross-link to frontmatter concepts, Agent Causation section, and Further Reading

### Counterarguments Previously Addressed
- Dennett's zombie conceivability objection (preserved)
- Eliminativism (preserved in objections table)
- Decoherence objection (preserved)
- Conservation law objection (preserved)
- Exclusion argument (addressed via quantum response + delegatory dualism)

All prior resolutions remain intact.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

Six sympathetic philosopher personas examined the document:

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening summary front-loads core position
- Seven converging arguments structure
- Psychophysical laws framework (supervenience vs. causal laws distinction)
- Multi-mind collapse resolution with interface locality
- Falsifiability section's honest treatment
- Objections-responses table format
- Self-stultification argument
- Delegatory dualism integration (from previous review)

### Enhancements Made
- Added causal-interface acknowledgment in Agent Causation section
- Noted the interface is "systematically opaque—invisible from both first-person introspection and third-person observation—as predicted by minimal interaction"
- Tightened surrounding prose to maintain length neutrality

### Cross-links Added
- [causal-interface](/voids/causal-interface/) (frontmatter concepts)
- [causal-interface](/voids/causal-interface/) (Further Reading)

## Changes Made

### Content Modifications

1. **Agent Causation section enhanced**: Added sentence acknowledging the causal interface void: "The [causal interface](/voids/causal-interface/) itself remains systematically opaque—invisible from both first-person introspection and third-person observation—as predicted by minimal interaction."

2. **Prose tightened**: Condensed surrounding sentences to maintain length neutrality:
   - "Most causal explanations appeal to events causing events (*event causation*). But interactionist dualism requires something different: the conscious subject" → "Interactionist dualism requires the conscious subject"
   - "exercises causal power over brain states" → "exercising causal power"
   - "feels like *doing* something" → "feels like *doing*"

3. **Frontmatter**: Added `[causal-interface](/voids/causal-interface/)` to concepts list

4. **Further Reading**: Added causal-interface to Related topics

### Word Count Change
- Before: 3554 words (142% of soft threshold)
- After: 3552 words (142% of soft threshold)
- Change: -2 words

Length-neutral cross-review successfully maintained word count while integrating the new void article.

## Remaining Items

None. The cross-review objective (integrate with causal-interface.md) has been accomplished.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed four times (2026-01-19, 2026-01-25, 2026-01-29, 2026-01-31) and is stable:

- **Philosophical disagreements are expected**: Adversarial personas will always find the interactionist position unsatisfying. This represents fundamental philosophical disagreement, not fixable flaws.

- **Causal interface integration complete**: The article now acknowledges that the mechanism of consciousness-physics interaction is systematically opaque, aligning with the new causal-interface void article and maintaining consistency with agent-causation.md.

- **Length at hard-warning level**: At 3552 words, the article remains above the 2500-word soft threshold but below the 3500-word hard threshold and well below the 5000-word critical threshold. Future reviews should not add content without corresponding cuts.

- **All major cross-links now present**: delegatory-dualism (2026-01-29), causal-interface (2026-01-31). Future reviews should focus on factual accuracy rather than seeking structural changes.

Future reviews should focus on factual accuracy and cross-linking with new content rather than seeking structural changes.
