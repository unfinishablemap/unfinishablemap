title: Deep Review - Consciousness-Only Territories
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-04
**Article**: [Consciousness-Only Territories](/voids/consciousness-only-territories/)
**Previous review**: [2026-02-01](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-01-consciousness-only-territories/)
**Cross-review context**: [The Epistemology of Cognitive Limits](/voids/epistemology-of-cognitive-limits/)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article has stabilized after the previous review's substantial engagement with physicalist objections.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Missing cross-link to epistemology-of-cognitive-limits**: The articles share thematic concerns (how we can know limits are genuine, whether territories truly exist vs. merely appear to). Cross-linking strengthens both.
   - **Resolution**: Added to related_articles and Further Reading section.

2. **Vague Royal Society citation**: Line 52 referred to "The 2024 Royal Society paper" without specifying authors.
   - **Resolution**: Updated to "Barrett and Stout's 2024 introduction to the Royal Society theme issue on embodied cognition"

### Low Issues Found
1. **AI refinement log comment remained**: Lines 164-181 contained an AI log marked "should be removed after human review" from the 2026-02-02 refinement.
   - **Resolution**: Removed.

### Counterarguments Considered
All six adversarial personas engaged:
- **Eliminative materialist**: Questions reifying qualia — bedrock disagreement per tenets
- **Hard-nosed physicalist**: Notes functionalist grounding remains viable — article already engages this substantially
- **Quantum skeptic**: Finds quantum speculation unsupported — article appropriately hedges
- **MWI defender**: Questions indexical assumptions — bedrock disagreement per No Many Worlds tenet
- **Empiricist**: Asks about falsifiability — acknowledged; philosophical analysis, not empirical claim
- **Buddhist philosopher**: Questions subject/object reification — bedrock disagreement per dualism tenet

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Sophisticated engagement with Lewis, Loar, and Dennett on the knowledge argument
- Face-recognition example (concrete, philosophically apt)
- "Eye that cannot see itself" metaphor (captures self-reference elegantly)
- Four-way taxonomy in "Mapping From Outside" section
- Appropriate quantum hedging (speculative mechanisms labeled as such)
- Clear, substantive Relation to Site Perspective section

### Enhancements Made
1. Added cross-link to [epistemology-of-cognitive-limits](/voids/epistemology-of-cognitive-limits/) — addresses the meta-question of whether we can determine consciousness-only territories are genuine
2. Improved Royal Society citation with author attribution (Barrett & Stout)
3. Removed stale AI refinement log comment

### Cross-links Added
- [epistemology-of-cognitive-limits](/voids/epistemology-of-cognitive-limits/) — How we can know whether cognitive limits are genuine

## Remaining Items

None. The article is mature and stable.

## Stability Notes

This review found **no critical issues** and only minor refinements needed (cross-linking, citation improvement, housekeeping). This indicates the article has reached stability after the previous review's substantial improvements.

**Bedrock disagreements** (not to be re-flagged in future reviews):
- Eliminative materialism vs. dualism: The article operates within dualist tenets
- MWI indexical critique: The No Many Worlds tenet commits the Map against MWI
- Functionalist grounding debate: The article engages substantively; remaining disagreement is philosophical standoff, not flaw

**Cross-review integration**: This review connected consciousness-only-territories to the epistemology-of-cognitive-limits article, which addresses the meta-question implicit in this article: how can we know territories are genuinely consciousness-only rather than merely appearing so? The epistemology article's discussion of Chomsky's problems/mysteries distinction and McGinn's permanent mysterianism provides the epistemological framework that grounds this article's claims about acquaintance knowledge.

## Word Count

- Before: 2800 words (140% of 2000 soft threshold)
- After: 2824 words (141% of 2000 soft threshold)
- Change: +24 words (cross-links offset by removal of ~150-word AI log)

The article remains above soft threshold but the increase is minimal and justified by cross-review integration.
