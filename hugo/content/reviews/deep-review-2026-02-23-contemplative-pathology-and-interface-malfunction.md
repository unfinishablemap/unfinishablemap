## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Misattribution of 2017 study**: Text said "Willoughby Britton's 2017 study" but the study is Lindahl et al. (2017) with Britton as last author. **Resolution**: Corrected to "Lindahl et al.'s 2017 mixed-methods study."
- **Broken frontmatter link**: `related_articles` included `loss-of-consciousness-and-the-mind-brain-relationship` which does not exist anywhere on the site. **Resolution**: Removed from frontmatter.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Unsupported treatment efficacy claim**: "Purely psychiatric approaches (medication adjusting neurotransmitter levels) are less effective" was presented as fact without citation. **Resolution**: Rewritten with appropriate hedging ("clinical reports suggest") and citation to Lindahl et al. 2017.
- **Tradition's own interpretation omitted**: The dukkha nanas were framed purely as "interface malfunction" without acknowledging the Theravada tradition's understanding of them as insight stages. **Resolution**: Added caveat paragraph acknowledging the tradition's self-understanding before applying the Map's reinterpretation.
- **Uncited Britton 2019 reference**: Paper was in References but never cited in text. **Resolution**: Integrated into the new caveat paragraph, supporting the inverted U-curve observation about contemplative practice intensity.
- **Ipseity disturbance parallel underdeveloped**: The connection to phenomenological psychiatry was mentioned but not developed. **Resolution**: Expanded with the embodiment polarity parallel (schizophrenia/depression mapping to disrupted access/filtering).

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative Materialist**: Default-mode network suppression explains depersonalization without interface. *Response*: Expected philosophical disagreement; article already implicitly addresses by arguing the interface model explains convergent disruption patterns from multiple causal pathways.
- **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: First-person reports taken at face value without reliability critique. *Response*: Valid concern but appropriate for the article's scope — the reliability of contemplative reports is addressed more fully in the contemplative-methods article.
- **Buddhist Philosopher**: Dukkha nanas are insight, not malfunction. *Response*: Addressed by adding the caveat paragraph acknowledging traditional interpretation.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent front-loaded opening paragraph — core claim survives any truncation
- Three-part interface disruption framework (temporal binding, content-access, phenomenal flooding) — novel and illuminating
- Pathology vs. achievement distinction framed as interface coherence vs. rigidity
- "What Contemplative Pathology Reveals" section — four strong philosophical arguments
- Clean, accessible prose throughout
- Parallel between anaesthetic and contemplative disruption of the same interface components
- Strong bidirectional interaction evidence (attention producing both construction and destruction)

### Enhancements Made
- Added caveat acknowledging Theravada tradition's interpretation of dukkha nanas as insight stages
- Integrated Britton 2019 citation (inverted U-curve of contemplative practice)
- Expanded ipseity disturbance parallel with embodiment polarity analysis
- Added inline citation to Sass & Parnas (2003) at point of use
- Hedged treatment efficacy claims with appropriate qualifiers
- Added citation to Lindahl et al. (2017) for treatment-related clinical observations

### Cross-links Added
No new cross-links needed — article already has comprehensive linking to relevant topics and concepts.

## Remaining Items

None. All critical and medium issues addressed.

## Stability Notes

- **Materialist objections are expected**: The eliminative materialist and physicalist personas object to the entire interface framework. This is a bedrock philosophical disagreement inherent to the Map's dualist position, not a flaw in this specific article.
- **First-person report reliability**: A valid philosophical concern but better addressed in the contemplative-methods article, which provides the methodological framework for taking contemplative reports seriously. Future reviews should not re-flag this as critical for this article.
- **Quantum mechanism in tenet section**: Standard Map language about quantum indeterminacies. The article doesn't overemphasize this — it's appropriately contained in the Relation to Site Perspective section. Not an article-specific issue.
