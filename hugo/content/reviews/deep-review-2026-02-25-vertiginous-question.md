title: Deep Review - The Vertiginous Question
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-25
**Article**: [The Vertiginous Question](/topics/vertiginous-question/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-26](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-26-vertiginous-question/)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article's structure, factual claims, and required sections are sound. No misattributions, self-contradictions, or source/Map conflations detected.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Outdated cross-link to archived article**: The Buddhist objection response referenced `[eastern-philosophy-haecceity-tension](/topics/eastern-philosophy-consciousness/)`, which has been archived and coalesced into "Eastern Philosophy and Consciousness." *Resolution*: Updated to `[process-haecceitism](/concepts/process-haecceitism/)`, which is the live concept page covering exactly the referenced "process haecceitism" response.

- **Hellie citation year off by one**: Cited as Hellie (2012) but the paper was published in *Analysis* 73(2) in 2013 (preprint was February 2012). *Resolution*: Corrected to 2013.

- **List citation year and incomplete reference**: Cited as "List, C. (2025)" but the paper was published in *Noûs* 57(2), 316-340, in 2023. *Resolution*: Corrected year and added volume/pages.

### Counterarguments Considered
All six pessimistic personas engaged. The article already handles their core objections well:

- **Eliminative Materialist**: The "No self to locate" objection addresses this adequately. The article's response that indexical puzzles survive even for processes (not just substances) is strong.
- **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: Dennett's heterophenomenological challenge was partially addressed in the previous review. The deflationary answer response handles this reasonably.
- **Quantum Skeptic**: Quantum section is properly hedged with "speculatively" and "philosophical proposal" language (fixed in previous review).
- **Many-Worlds Defender**: Self-locating uncertainty defense is now presented before rejection (improved in previous review). Bedrock disagreement.
- **Empiricist**: Haecceity's empirical testability concern is a bedrock disagreement per previous review.
- **Buddhist Philosopher**: The "No self to locate" objection and process haecceitism response are well-crafted.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent opening that distinguishes the vertiginous question from the hard problem and personal identity
- Phenomenological writing that genuinely induces the vertiginous feeling
- The three failed answers structure (biological, psychological, deflationary) is pedagogically clear
- List's argument against third-personal metaphysics is well-presented
- Self-locating beliefs section showing they presuppose rather than explain indexical facts
- Balanced objections section with genuine engagement (four objections, each given fair treatment)
- Comprehensive five-tenet connection in "Relation to Site Perspective"
- Effective use of italicized emphasis on indexical terms (*I*, *this*, *mine*)

### Enhancements Made
- Updated outdated link to archived article → live `[process-haecceitism](/concepts/process-haecceitism/)` concept page
- Corrected two citation errors (Hellie year, List year and volume)
- Added `[process-haecceitism](/concepts/process-haecceitism/)` to Further Reading and concepts frontmatter
- Added `[indexical-void](/voids/indexical-void/)` to Further Reading (natural companion on limits of indexical knowledge)

### Cross-links Added
- [process-haecceitism](/concepts/process-haecceitism/) (replacing archived link, added to Further Reading and frontmatter)
- [indexical-void](/voids/indexical-void/) (added to Further Reading)

## Remaining Items

None. The article is in excellent shape after two reviews. All medium issues were bibliographic corrections or link maintenance rather than substantive content problems.

## Stability Notes

The previous review's stability notes remain in effect:

- **MWI defenders will find the indexical objection question-begging**: Self-locating uncertainty vs. indexical facts is a bedrock disagreement. Not a flaw to fix.
- **Eliminativists will find the question meaningless**: The article now engages this directly through the Buddhist/eliminativist objection. Not a flaw to fix.
- **Empiricists may find haecceity empirically vacuous**: The article's position (haecceity as potentially primitive) is defensible but empirically untestable. Not a flaw to fix.

**New stability note**: The article has now been reviewed twice with no critical issues found in either review. The content is stable. Future reviews should focus on verifying that cross-links remain valid and that new Map content hasn't introduced connections worth adding, rather than seeking substantive rewrites.
