title: Deep Review - Indian Philosophy of Mind
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-23
**Article**: [Indian Philosophy of Mind](/topics/indian-philosophy-of-mind/)
**Previous review**: [2026-02-22](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-22-indian-philosophy-of-mind/)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. Previous review found no critical issues; article unchanged since that review. All attributions, verse references, and source/Map separation remain accurate.

### Attribution Accuracy Check
No changes needed — previous review verified all attributions. No new claims added.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing cross-links to core dualism articles**: The previous review noted cross-links were "comprehensive," but this was assessed against the article's immediate neighbours, not against the Map's core dualism infrastructure. Six core dualism articles had natural connection points that weren't linked: dualism concept page, the-convergence-argument-for-dualism, interaction-problem-in-non-western-philosophy, causal-closure, philosophy-of-perception-under-dualism, objections-to-interactionism, and the-case-for-dualism. [Resolution: All seven links added in-text and in Further Reading.]

### Counterarguments Considered
All counterarguments from the previous review remain adequately addressed. No new counterarguments identified. Per stability notes from previous review:
- Eliminative materialist dismissal: bedrock disagreement, not re-flagged
- Samkhya passive purusha tension: genuine philosophical choice, not re-flagged
- Quantum parallel: already qualified, not re-flagged

### Unsupported Claims
None identified.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Three-way comparison table (clear, distinctive)
- "Internal disagreement within a single culture" framing (novel)
- "Consciousness without essential consciousness" (Nyaya's unique contribution)
- Ramanuja's critique presentation (philosophically engaged)
- "Metaphysics as soteriology" (distinctive contribution)
- Filter theory connection (apt)
- Samkhya's three-way distinction (philosophically productive)

### Enhancements Made
- **[dualism](/concepts/dualism/) link**: Added to Samkhya section (line 43) where Cartesian dualism is compared — connects to the core concept page
- **[objections-to-interactionism](/concepts/objections-to-interactionism/) link**: Samkhya's approach reframed as sidestepping standard interactionist objections, connecting to the Map's catalogue of challenges
- **[causal-closure](/concepts/causal-closure/) link**: Made explicit that Samkhya preserves causal closure — a key advantage for the Map's framework
- **[interaction-problem-in-non-western-philosophy](/topics/interaction-problem-in-non-western-philosophy/) link**: Connected Samkhya's interaction problem to the dedicated comparative article
- **[philosophy-of-perception-under-dualism](/topics/philosophy-of-perception-under-dualism/) link**: Connected Nyaya's perception theory to modern dualist perception theories
- **[the-convergence-argument-for-dualism](/topics/the-convergence-argument-for-dualism/) link**: Made explicit that the three-school convergence is an instance of the convergence argument operating within a single culture
- **[the-case-for-dualism](/concepts/the-case-for-dualism/) link**: Connected the Dualism tenet section to the cumulative case article

### Cross-links Added
- [dualism](/concepts/dualism/) — core concept page
- [the-convergence-argument-for-dualism](/topics/the-convergence-argument-for-dualism/) — epistemological structure of the convergence
- [the-case-for-dualism](/concepts/the-case-for-dualism/) — cumulative case for dualism
- [interaction-problem-in-non-western-philosophy](/topics/interaction-problem-in-non-western-philosophy/) — comparative survey
- [causal-closure](/concepts/causal-closure/) — Samkhya preserves closure
- [philosophy-of-perception-under-dualism](/topics/philosophy-of-perception-under-dualism/) — Nyaya perception parallels
- [objections-to-interactionism](/concepts/objections-to-interactionism/) — challenges Samkhya sidesteps

## Remaining Items

None. All targeted cross-links added. No follow-up tasks needed.

## Stability Notes

All stability notes from the previous review (2026-02-22) remain in effect:
- **Eliminative materialist dismissal**: Bedrock disagreement, convergence-based argument is sufficient. Do not re-flag.
- **Samkhya passive purusha vs. Bidirectional Interaction**: Genuine philosophical choice, honestly documented. Do not pressure resolution.
- **Quantum parallel**: Already appropriately qualified. Do not demand changes.
- **Cross-links now comprehensive**: With seven new links to core dualism infrastructure, the article is now well-integrated into the Map's dualism network. Future reviews should not add further cross-links unless new dualism articles are created that have specific relevance.
