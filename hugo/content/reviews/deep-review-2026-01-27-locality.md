title: Deep Review - Locality and Mind-Matter Interaction
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-01-27
**Article**: [Locality and Mind-Matter Interaction](/concepts/locality/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-19](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-19-locality/)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Broken links to coalesced articles**: The previous review added links to `[interface-locality](/interface-locality/)` and `[brain-specialness](/brain-specialness/)`, but these articles were subsequently coalesced into `[brain-interface-boundary](/concepts/brain-interface-boundary/)`. All six references (two in body text, two in frontmatter, two in Further Reading) were broken. → Updated all links to point to the new coalesced article.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Response 3 (Simulation) remains tangential**: The simulation argument essentially says "if we're in a simulation, locality isn't a problem." The article correctly notes this "doesn't require believing we *are* simulated," but the argument's force depends on the simulation hypothesis being plausible. → Left unchanged; the section correctly functions as a perspective-shift argument showing the objection is metaphysics-dependent.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist critique**: Physical laws are descriptive regularities, not agents "coordinating" anything. → The article's leveling argument remains valid; we accept physical law coordination without demanding mechanism.
- **Empiricist falsifiability concern**: No empirical test proposed. → This is a conceptual clarification article, not an empirical proposal. The article explicitly notes it "doesn't prove" the mechanism.
- **MWI dissolution of locality**: MWI proponents would note their interpretation dissolves locality differently. → This is a bedrock disagreement; the Map rejects MWI per Tenet 4.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening summary: Clear, confident problem/solution statement with strong front-loading
- Response 1: The leveling argument comparing consciousness coordination to universal physical law coordination
- The three-pronged summary in Relation to Site Perspective ("proves too much," "assumes too little," "metaphysics-dependent")
- Binding-entanglement connection noting quantum entanglement may help rather than hinder binding
- Epistemic humility about mechanism details

### Enhancements Made
- Updated all broken links from `[interface-locality](/interface-locality/)`/`[brain-specialness](/brain-specialness/)` to `[brain-interface-boundary](/concepts/brain-interface-boundary/)`
- Consolidated duplicate Further Reading entries into single entry for coalesced article
- Added cross-link to `[free-will](/topics/free-will/)` (quantum selection relates to libertarian free will)
- Updated concepts frontmatter to reference the new coalesced article

### Cross-links Updated
- `[brain-interface-boundary](/concepts/brain-interface-boundary/)` (replacing `[interface-locality](/interface-locality/)` and `[brain-specialness](/brain-specialness/)`)
- `[free-will](/topics/free-will/)` (new)

## Remaining Items

None. All critical issues addressed. The article now correctly references the coalesced brain-interface-boundary article throughout.

## Stability Notes

This article reached good stability after the 2026-01-19 review. The changes since then (2026-01-26) were style/terminology updates, not substantive content modifications. The current review addressed only link maintenance issues caused by article coalescing elsewhere in the Map.

The following represent bedrock philosophical disagreements, not fixable flaws:
- **MWI proponents** will always find collapse-based frameworks unsatisfying—this is Tenet 4, not a gap to fill
- **Eliminative materialists** will object that "consciousness coordinating" reifies something that doesn't exist—this is the core dualism debate
- **Empiricists** will want testable predictions—the article correctly notes it provides conceptual clarification, not empirical proposal

Future reviews should NOT re-flag these as critical issues.
