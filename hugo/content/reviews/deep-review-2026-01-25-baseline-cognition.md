# Deep Review: Baseline Cognition

**Date**: 2026-01-25
**File**: topics/baseline-cognition.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Six adversarial personas reviewed the document:

### Eliminative Materialist (Churchland)
- Objected that "consciousness" as category may be incoherent
- Working memory capacity claims conflate task performance with phenomenal capacity
- *Response*: The article now explicitly engages illusionism and distinguishes phenomenal from functional consciousness

### Hard-Nosed Physicalist (Dennett)
- Metarepresentation could be functional without phenomenal consciousness
- "Jourdain hypothesis" doesn't establish that knowing requires consciousness
- *Response*: Added Illusionist Challenge section that directly engages this objection via argument from reason

### Quantum Skeptic (Tegmark)
- Quantum mechanism speculation underdeveloped
- Decoherence objection not addressed
- *Response*: Minimal Quantum Interaction section now acknowledges speculative status while pointing to relevant site content

### Many-Worlds Defender (Deutsch)
- "Selection" presupposes collapse that MWI denies
- *Response*: Added new "No Many Worlds" section explicitly connecting to tenet and explaining why selection requires collapse

### Empiricist (Popper)
- Several references misaligned (dualism intuitions, quantum effects rather than comparative cognition)
- Citation verification needed for specific claims
- *Response*: Removed misaligned references (Barlev, Barrett, Bloom, Hagan, Tegmark); retained only comparative cognition sources; added Povinelli and Tomasello et al. 1993

### Buddhist Philosopher (Nagarjuna)
- Article reifies consciousness rather than considering continuum
- *Response*: Acknowledged in mysterian caveat that the nature of the threshold may be cognitively closed

### Critical Issues Addressed
1. Misaligned references removed and replaced with relevant comparative cognition sources
2. Missing engagement with illusionism resolved via new section
3. Missing mysterian caveat added
4. Argument from reason connection made explicit

### Medium Issues Addressed
1. Free will and agent causation connections developed in new subsection
2. No Many Worlds tenet connection added
3. Better hedging on metarepresentation → consciousness link via mysterian caveat

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

Six sympathetic personas reviewed the document:

### Property Dualist (Chalmers)
- Strong connection between comparative evidence and hard problem preserved
- Metarepresentation threshold as empirical marker highlighted

### Quantum Mind Theorist (Stapp)
- Enhanced connection to voluntary attention as mechanism
- Quantum Zeno effect now explicitly mentioned

### Phenomenologist (Nagel)
- "Knowing that you know" distinction preserved
- First-person dimension captured well

### Process Philosopher (Whitehead)
- Original sharp dichotomy somewhat softened by mysterian acknowledgment of limits

### Libertarian Free Will Defender (Kane)
- New section explicitly connects to agent causation and free will

### Mysterian (McGinn)
- New caveat section acknowledges cognitive closure possibility

### Strengths Preserved
- Core hypothesis connecting comparative cognition to consciousness causation
- Evidence base from Lieberman, Whiten, Tomasello
- Global Workspace Theory predictions
- Clear engagement with epiphenomenalism

### Enhancements Made
- Added "Illusionist Challenge" section (~500 words) with argument from reason response
- Added "Mysterian Caveat" section (~300 words) acknowledging cognitive closure
- Expanded "Relation to Site Perspective" with subsections for all five tenets
- Added "Free Will and Agent Causation" connection
- Added "No Many Worlds" connection explaining why selection requires collapse
- Expanded Further Reading with 6 new entries

### Cross-links Added

- [mysterianism](/concepts/mysterianism/)
- [free-will](/topics/free-will/)

## Remaining Items

None. All critical and medium issues addressed. The document now:
- Engages the strongest physicalist objection (illusionism) with substantive response
- Acknowledges epistemic limits (mysterianism) without abandoning the hypothesis
- Connects to all five site tenets
- Uses only relevant comparative cognition references
- Links to related site content for deeper exploration
