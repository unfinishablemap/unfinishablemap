title: Deep Review - Bergson and Duration
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-22
**Article**: [Bergson and Duration](/topics/bergson-and-duration/)
**Previous review**: [2026-02-22 (earlier today)](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-22-bergson-and-duration/)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. All previous review findings confirmed. Attribution accuracy checks all pass. No internal contradictions. Required sections present.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Missing specious present connection** (NEW): The article discussed durée at length but never connected to the specious present—the empirical and philosophical tradition (Clay, James, Husserl) that independently confirmed Bergson's core phenomenological claim. The temporal-consciousness concept page treats durée and the specious present as complementary, but this article lacked that explicit bridge. **Resolution**: Added a paragraph in the "Contemporary Relevance" section connecting durée to the specious present tradition, noting empirical timescale estimates (300-750ms core, 2-3s horizon) and Husserl's retention-protention structure as formalising what Bergson captured with interpenetration.

### Issues from Previous Review (all confirmed resolved)

- Oversimplified reversibility claim → qualified with three-way distinction
- MWI argument too quick → rewritten for ontological significance
- Contemplative corroboration lacked citations → specific examples added
- No engagement with unfalsifiability of intuition → addressed with disciplined attention paragraph

### Counterarguments Considered

All counterarguments from previous review remain adequately addressed. No new counterarguments arise from the specious present addition—it strengthens the article's empirical grounding.

### Attribution Accuracy Check

All checks pass (confirmed from previous review, re-verified):
- Misattribution: PASS
- Qualifier preservation: PASS
- Position strength: PASS
- Source/Map separation: PASS
- Self-contradiction: PASS

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Excellent opening paragraph stating thesis and why Bergson matters for dualism
- Clean four-feature durée characterization (heterogeneity, interpenetration, indivisibility, irreversibility)
- Melody analogy for interpenetration
- Honest élan vital treatment
- Well-balanced Bergson-Whitehead comparison
- Good source/Map separation throughout
- All improvements from earlier review (irreversibility qualification, MWI argument, contemplative examples, intuition engagement)

### Enhancements Made

- Added specious present paragraph connecting durée to independent empirical and philosophical tradition
- Noted Husserl's retention-protention structure as formalising Bergson's interpenetration
- Connected to temporal-thickness concept for phenomenal density

### Cross-links Added

- [temporal-consciousness](/concepts/temporal-consciousness/) (specious present anchor in Contemporary Relevance)

## Remaining Items

None. The article now connects well to both the phenomenological tradition and the Map's temporal consciousness framework.

## Stability Notes

All stability notes from previous review carry forward:
- **Eliminative materialist disagreement**: Bedrock philosophical disagreement, not a fixable flaw.
- **Buddhist momentariness tension**: Genuine open question for future articles.
- **Élan vital**: Honest acknowledgment of criticism is the right approach.
- **Specious present connection**: Now established. Future reviews should not significantly expand this—the article is about Bergson, not the specious present per se. The temporal-consciousness concept page provides the detailed treatment.
