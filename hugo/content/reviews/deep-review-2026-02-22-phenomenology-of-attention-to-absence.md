**Date**: 2026-02-22
**Article**: [The Phenomenology of Attention to Absence](/topics/phenomenology-of-attention-to-absence/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article is well-written with accurate attributions throughout.

### Medium Issues Found
- [Missing cross-links to temporal consciousness concepts]: Added wikilinks to [protention](/concepts/protention/), [temporal-consciousness](/concepts/temporal-consciousness/), [phenomenology-of-anticipation](/topics/phenomenology-of-anticipation/), and [phenomenal-intentionality](/concepts/intentionality/) in the body text
- [Weak engagement with functionalist objection]: Added a paragraph in the Sartre section engaging with the functionalist reply that predictive models represent absence as discrepancies, while maintaining Sartre's point about phenomenal character
- [MMN claim lacked citation]: Added Näätänen et al. (2007) citation for the mismatch negativity claim
- [Sparse Further Reading section]: Expanded from 6 to 10 entries, adding [phenomenology-of-anticipation](/topics/phenomenology-of-anticipation/), [phenomenal-intentionality](/concepts/intentionality/), [protention](/concepts/protention/), and [phenomenology-of-the-edge](/voids/phenomenology-of-the-edge/)

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Functionalist objection (Dennett)**: Predictive processing systems represent absence as model discrepancies. Addressed by adding a paragraph acknowledging the functional structure while maintaining the phenomenal point.
- **Eliminative materialist (Churchland)**: Absence-perception may be folk-psychological overlay on prediction error. The article's response (prediction error doesn't explain the phenomenal character) is appropriate — this is the hard problem applied to absence.
- **Buddhist (Nagarjuna)**: Expectations arise from conditioning without requiring a unified experiencer. Acknowledged as genuine philosophical tension but not a flaw requiring correction in a dualist-committed framework.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening paragraph: vivid, philosophically immediate, truncation-resilient
- Five-variety taxonomy of experienced absence with concrete examples
- Sartre's Pierre analysis: thorough and well-integrated
- "Silence where the clock used to tick" — extremely vivid phenomenological description
- "Relation to Site Perspective" substantively connects to three tenets
- Appropriate restraint in not invoking quantum mechanisms

### Enhancements Made
- Added cross-links to [protention](/concepts/protention/) and [temporal-consciousness](/concepts/temporal-consciousness/) in the temporal structure section
- Added [phenomenal-intentionality](/concepts/intentionality/) link and supporting sentence in the intentionality section
- Added [phenomenology-of-anticipation](/topics/phenomenology-of-anticipation/) and [protention](/concepts/protention/) links in the expectation-violation section
- Engaged with functionalist objection in the Sartre section
- Added Näätänen et al. (2007) citation for MMN
- Expanded Further Reading with 4 new entries
- Added [phenomenology-of-anticipation](/topics/phenomenology-of-anticipation/) and [phenomenal-intentionality](/concepts/intentionality/) to related_articles frontmatter

### Cross-links Added
- [protention](/concepts/protention/)
- [temporal-consciousness](/concepts/temporal-consciousness/)
- [phenomenology-of-anticipation](/topics/phenomenology-of-anticipation/)
- [phenomenal-intentionality](/concepts/intentionality/)
- [phenomenology-of-the-edge](/voids/phenomenology-of-the-edge/)

## Remaining Items

None. The article is in good shape after these improvements.

## Stability Notes

- The functionalist objection (that predictive models represent absence) is a genuine philosophical disagreement, not a fixable flaw. The added paragraph acknowledges the objection and responds — future reviews should not re-flag this.
- The eliminative materialist and Buddhist philosopher objections represent bedrock philosophical disagreements with the Map's dualist framework. These are expected disagreements, not issues to address.
- The article appropriately avoids quantum mechanisms despite being on the Map. This restraint should be preserved in future reviews.
