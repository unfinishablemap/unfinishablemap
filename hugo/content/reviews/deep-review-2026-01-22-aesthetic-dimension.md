**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Inverted aesthetic qualia argument needed strengthening**: The original claim that "it seems" there are no structural asymmetries in aesthetic space was merely asserted without engaging with the obvious objection from functional asymmetries (reward systems, approach/avoidance).
   - **Resolution**: Added explicit engagement with the objection, explaining why functional responses are *consequences* of aesthetic experience rather than constitutive of it.

2. **Illusionist response was generic**: The regress objection is standard but the article didn't engage with Frankish's actual response—that seemings can be functional without being phenomenal.
   - **Resolution**: Added direct engagement with Frankish's position, then explained why the distinctive real-time normativity of aesthetic experience makes this response particularly unconvincing for aesthetics.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Buddhist contemplative section was thin**: Mentioned *samvega* but didn't develop the rich tradition of Indian aesthetics (*rasa* theory) or connect to jhāna phenomenology.
   - **Resolution**: Expanded with *rasa* theory discussion and jhāna aesthetic qualities.

2. **MQI tenet connection was speculative hand-waving**: Original text made vague claims about aesthetic attention concentrating quantum influence without substance.
   - **Resolution**: Toned down speculation, acknowledged that phenomenological arguments stand independently of quantum mechanisms.

3. **Missing cross-links**: No connection to recently created articles on meaning-and-consciousness, cognitive-phenomenology, consciousness-and-creativity.
   - **Resolution**: Added these to concepts frontmatter and Further Reading.

### Counterarguments Considered

- Eliminative materialist challenge: Neuroscience provides correlates but this was already addressed as insufficient for explaining why anything *seems* beautiful.
- Functional asymmetry objection: Now explicitly addressed in the inverted qualia section.
- Frankish's illusionist response: Now directly engaged with.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- The phenomenological descriptions in "Pervasiveness of Aesthetic Quality" section—excellent first-person analysis of how aesthetic quality saturates experience across domains.
- The Process Philosophy section's development of Whitehead's framework.
- The "What Would Challenge This View?" section—exemplary practice of specifying falsification conditions.
- The extension of explanatory gap arguments to aesthetics specifically.
- The insight that abstract thought has aesthetic character (mathematical elegance, etc.).

### Enhancements Made

1. Strengthened inverted qualia argument with explicit engagement with functional asymmetry objection.
2. Expanded Buddhist contemplative evidence with *rasa* theory and jhāna phenomenology.
3. Improved Frankish engagement in illusionist section.
4. Toned down speculative MQI tenet connection.
5. Added cross-links to three recently created related articles.
