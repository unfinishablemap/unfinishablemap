**Date**: 2026-01-29
**Article**: [Computational Cognitive Limits](/voids/computational-cognitive-limits/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Rice's theorem description was imprecise**: The article claimed Rice's theorem shows we "cannot algorithmically determine whether a program prints 'hello'" which is incorrect—Rice's theorem applies to non-trivial semantic properties of the *partial function computed*, not all behavioural properties. **Resolution**: Corrected the description to accurately describe the theorem's scope (partial functions, semantic properties).

### Medium Issues Found
- **Lucas-Penrose framing slightly unbalanced**: Presented the argument as merely "contested" when it's actually a minority position that most cognitive scientists reject. **Resolution**: Added explicit note that "Most cognitive scientists and AI researchers reject this argument" while preserving the philosophical interest of the position.

- **Wolfram's computational irreducibility overstated**: Presented as a "fundamental limit" when it's actually a thesis about certain systems, not a proven universal result. **Resolution**: Changed "identifies...as a fundamental limit" to "proposes...as a limit" and "His thesis:" to make the status clearer.

- **Missing cross-links**: Article lacked connections to closely related content. **Resolution**: Added cross-links to [consciousness-and-mathematical-understanding](/topics/consciousness-and-mathematical-understanding/), [mysterianism](/concepts/mysterianism/), and [phenomenology-of-the-edge](/voids/phenomenology-of-the-edge/).

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist objection**: The article handles this reasonably—notes that critics say we follow proof procedures mechanically, that the argument assumes consistency.
- **MWI objection**: Not directly addressed in article (MWI would eliminate collapse). This is acceptable as the article is about computational limits, not quantum interpretation debates.
- **Reification of consciousness**: Buddhist critique that the article treats consciousness as a unified "something." This is a valid philosophical point but represents a bedrock framework difference, not an error to fix.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- **Four-part phenomenology taxonomy**: "Infinite regress," "asymptotic approach," "dissolving prediction," "recognising without grasping" — original and philosophically valuable contribution
- **Opening summary**: Effectively front-loads the key claim about mathematical proof of unknowability
- **Hedged language**: Appropriately tentative when moving from math to consciousness ("If correct," "The Map suggests")
- **Tenet connections**: Well-drawn connections to all five tenets, especially Occam's Razor Has Limits
- **"Recognition without comprehension" phrasing**: Captures an authentic phenomenal state

### Enhancements Made
- Added [consciousness-and-mathematical-understanding](/topics/consciousness-and-mathematical-understanding/) to concepts frontmatter
- Cross-linked to [mysterianism](/concepts/mysterianism/) in the AI section to connect the speculative discussion to the formal mysterian framework
- Cross-linked to [phenomenology-of-the-edge](/voids/phenomenology-of-the-edge/) in the phenomenology section to connect related explorations
- Improved Rice's theorem accuracy (1951 → 1953 date correction, Henry Rice → Rice for consistency)

### Cross-links Added
- [consciousness-and-mathematical-understanding](/topics/consciousness-and-mathematical-understanding/) — in Gödel section and frontmatter
- [mysterianism](/concepts/mysterianism/) — in AI section discussion of Penrose
- [phenomenology-of-the-edge](/voids/phenomenology-of-the-edge/) — in phenomenology section

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues have been addressed.

## Stability Notes

The following represent philosophical disagreements, not fixable problems:

- **MWI defenders will reject the collapse framing**: The article assumes collapse is real. Everettians will find this question-begging. This is a tenet-level commitment (No Many Worlds), not an error.

- **Eliminative materialists will reject the phenomenology framing**: The idea that approaching computational limits has a "distinctive phenomenology" assumes phenomenology is real and informative. Dennett-style critics will see this as anthropomorphising algorithms. This reflects the Map's commitment to taking consciousness seriously.

- **The Lucas-Penrose argument is contested**: The article now correctly notes this is a minority position. Future reviews should not re-flag this as "insufficiently balanced"—the article presents the argument, notes the mainstream rejection, and preserves philosophical interest. This is appropriate treatment.
