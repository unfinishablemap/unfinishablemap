title: Deep Review - Altered States of Consciousness
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-03-01
**Article**: [Altered States of Consciousness](/concepts/altered-states-of-consciousness/)
**Previous review**: [2026-02-25](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-25-altered-states-of-consciousness/)
**Context**: Cross-review considering phenomenological-psychiatry insights

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The article has been through three prior reviews and is structurally stable. No new factual errors, misattributions, or internal contradictions found.

### Medium Issues Found

- **Psychiatric ASCs missing dedicated treatment**: The opening paragraph mentions psychiatric conditions (depersonalization, schizophrenia) and links to the phenomenological-psychiatry article, but the "Specific States" section has no subsection covering them—despite dedicated subsections for psychedelics, flow, hypnosis, meditation, and NDEs. Resolution: added "Psychiatric Conditions" subsection integrating key insights from phenomenological psychiatry.
- **Form/content distinction not leveraged**: Phenomenological psychiatry's central insight—that psychiatric conditions disrupt the *form* of experience, not just content—directly strengthens the filter theory argument but was absent. Resolution: integrated into new subsection, showing that psychiatric ASCs alter how filtering itself works.
- **Missing cross-link**: `phenomenological-psychiatry-and-altered-experience` not in related_articles or Further Reading despite the opening paragraph linking to it inline. Resolution: added to both.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Dennett-style functionalist objection**: Flow and meditation as modified information processing. Bedrock disagreement from prior reviews — not re-flagged.
- **MWI phenomenological argument weakness**: Bedrock disagreement from prior reviews — not re-flagged.
- **Materialist objection to psychiatric ASC interpretation**: The tight correlation between pharmacological intervention and experiential change (antidepressants reopening temporal horizon, antipsychotics reducing ipseity disturbance) could be read as supporting production. The phenomenological-psychiatry article already addresses this caveat (correlation proves interface, not identity), and the new subsection doesn't overstate the case.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Excellent filter theory framing in opening paragraph
- Propofol/ketamine divergence argument (strongest empirical case in the article)
- Well-integrated Tart taxonomy with 2025 thalamic research
- Appropriate hedging on Orch OR/quantum claims
- Boundary States section providing creative philosophical integration
- Substantive "Relation to Site Perspective" connecting to all relevant tenets
- Strong confabulation response with clinical evidence

### Enhancements Made

- Added "Psychiatric Conditions" subsection (~185 words) covering ipseity disturbance, temporal collapse, embodiment polarity, and depersonalization as architectural revelation
- Integrated the form/content distinction to strengthen the filter theory argument
- Added cross-link to `phenomenological-psychiatry-and-altered-experience` in related_articles and Further Reading
- Added Fuchs (2005) citation for embodiment claims

### Cross-links Added

- [phenomenological-psychiatry-and-altered-experience](/topics/phenomenological-psychiatry-and-altered-experience/)

## Word Count

Before: 1969 words (79% of 2500 soft threshold)
After: 2178 words (87% of 2500 soft threshold)

Change: +209 words. Article remains under threshold.

## Remaining Items

None. All cross-review integration completed.

## Stability Notes

This is the fourth deep review. The article has reached content stability — its arguments, structure, and citations are sound. This review's contribution was cross-review integration: connecting the article to the phenomenological-psychiatry article through a new subsection on psychiatric altered states.

- **Bedrock disagreements** (MWI phenomenological argument, functionalist interpretation of meditation/flow) remain acknowledged from prior reviews and should not be re-flagged.
- **Future reviews** should check: (1) whether new phenomenology-related articles warrant additional cross-links, (2) whether the psychiatric conditions subsection needs expansion if the phenomenological-psychiatry article is significantly updated. The article should not need further structural changes.
