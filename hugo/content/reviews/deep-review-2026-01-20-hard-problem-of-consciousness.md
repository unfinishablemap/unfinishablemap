# Deep Review: The Hard Problem of Consciousness

**Date**: 2026-01-20
**File**: obsidian/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-10T15:30:00+00:00

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None identified (existing article is comprehensive)

### Medium Issues Found
- **Illusionism treatment incomplete**: Dennett's heterophenomenology method not mentioned
  - **Resolution**: Added explanation of heterophenomenology and regress objection
- **Decoherence objection underaddressed**: Article referenced quantum consciousness but didn't engage with Tegmark's thermal decoherence calculations
  - **Resolution**: Added paragraph on decoherence objection with recent quantum biology responses (Kerskens & Pérez 2022, Wiest et al. 2024)
- **Missing falsifiability section**: Article didn't specify what would challenge the hard problem's "hardness"
  - **Resolution**: Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section with five potential challenges

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialism (Churchland)**: Folk psychology critique—qualia concepts may be confused
  - Addressed implicitly through engagement with illusionism
- **Dennett's zombic hunch**: Intuitions about zombies may be unreliable
  - Partially addressed; could be expanded in future
- **Buddhist no-self**: Witness may be empty of inherent existence
  - **Resolution**: Added buddhism-and-dualism link and challenge in "What Would Challenge This View?"
- **Tegmark quantum skepticism**: Decoherence destroys coherence too fast
  - **Resolution**: Added decoherence paragraph with recent counter-evidence

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent opening hook ("Why is there something it is like to be you?")
- Vivid C. elegans illustration of explanatory gap
- Strong temporal phenomenology treatment
- Comprehensive survey of responses (IIT, Russellian monism, idealism, etc.)
- Well-structured progression from problem to responses to site perspective
- Zombie argument and Mary's Room clearly presented

### Enhancements Made
1. **Expanded illusionism section**: Added Dennett's heterophenomenology, regress objection, and introspection reliability link
2. **Added decoherence response**: Addressed quantum skeptic objection with recent research
3. **Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section**: Five falsifiability conditions
4. **Added process philosophy perspective**: Whitehead's actual occasions as alternative framing
5. **Updated Further Reading**: Added introspection, decoherence, arguments-for-dualism, buddhism-and-dualism links

### Cross-links Added
- [introspection](/concepts/introspection/) — Introspective reliability debate bears on illusionism
- [decoherence](/concepts/decoherence/) — Quantum skeptic objection and responses
- [arguments-for-dualism](/concepts/arguments-for-dualism/) — Converging evidence for dualism
- [buddhism-and-dualism](/concepts/buddhism-and-dualism/) — Buddhist challenge to the witness
