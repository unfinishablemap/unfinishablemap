title: Deep Review - Sensorimotor Contingencies and the Interface
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-18
**Article**: [Sensorimotor Contingencies and the Interface](/topics/sensorimotor-contingencies-and-the-interface/)
**Previous review**: Never (first deep review; a pessimistic batch review covered this article in [2026-02-15](/reviews/pessimistic-2026-02-15-late/))

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Leib/Körper misattribution**: Article attributed the *Leib/Körper* distinction to Merleau-Ponty; this is Husserl's German terminology. Merleau-Ponty (writing in French) used *corps propre*. Resolution: Reworded to attribute the German terms to Husserl and note Merleau-Ponty's development of the concept.
- **"Medium-dependent contingencies" fabrication**: Article claimed O'Regan and Noë's theory "identifies three levels of contingency" including a third "medium-dependent" category. The 2001 paper identifies only two: apparatus-dependent and object-dependent. Modality differences are explained through apparatus-dependent contingencies. Resolution: Restructured to accurately present two categories, with modality explanation folded into apparatus-dependent contingencies.
- **Bach-y-Rita paraphrase in quotation marks**: A paraphrase of Bach-y-Rita's findings was presented with quotation marks as if a direct quote. Resolution: Removed quotation marks and rephrased as a description of research findings.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Opening sentence used prohibited pattern**: "Perception is not the passive reception of sensory data. It is the mastery of..." uses the "This is not X. It is Y." construct the writing style guide explicitly bans. Resolution: Simplified to direct positive claim.
- **Missing No Many Worlds tenet**: Relation to Site Perspective connected to only 4 of 5 tenets. Resolution: Added No Many Worlds paragraph.
- **Phantom limb section overpromised**: Claimed the interface model "predicts different things about the interface's limits" without specifying testable differential predictions. Resolution: Rewritten to honestly acknowledge that both accounts accommodate the same phenomena, with the interface reading offering a philosophical interpretation rather than unique empirical predictions.
- **AI refinement log left in article**: HTML comment from previous pessimistic review fixes was still present, marked "should be removed after human review." Resolution: Removed.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Enactivists reject the interface concept**: O'Regan, Noë, and the enactivist tradition explicitly reject consciousness engaging "through" an interface. Already addressed in a previous refinement pass (2026-02-15) with explicit acknowledgment of this tension in the Dualism tenet section. Fix was adequate — not revisited.
- **Neural plasticity explains sensory substitution without interface**: Already addressed in a previous refinement pass (2026-02-15) with fair assessment paragraph. Fix was adequate — not revisited.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- The two-horn dilemma for sensorimotor contingency theorists (either functionalism + hard problem, or implicit invocation of something beyond function)
- The grammar metaphor — the article's most original theoretical contribution
- The fair assessment paragraph on sensory substitution evidence ("compatible with" rather than "uniquely predicted by")
- The phantom limb as interface persistence (now with honest epistemic framing)
- Explicit engagement with enactivist tension in the Dualism tenet section
- The "prosthetic limb as new dialect" phrasing
- The opening paragraph's direct, front-loaded core claim

### Enhancements Made
- Fixed three attribution errors (Leib/Körper, three-level taxonomy, Bach-y-Rita quote)
- Added No Many Worlds tenet coverage (all 5 tenets now addressed)
- Added cross-links: [predictive-processing-and-the-maps-framework](/topics/predictive-processing-and-the-maps-framework/), [mysterianism](/concepts/mysterianism/)
- Added [mysterianism](/concepts/mysterianism/) to concepts frontmatter
- Added [predictive-processing-and-the-maps-framework](/topics/predictive-processing-and-the-maps-framework/) to related_articles frontmatter
- Removed obsolete AI refinement log HTML comment

### Cross-links Added
- [predictive-processing-and-the-maps-framework](/topics/predictive-processing-and-the-maps-framework/) — sensorimotor contingencies as structural constraints on predictive processing
- [mysterianism](/concepts/mysterianism/) — cognitive closure and the limits of what the grammar metaphor can reveal

## Remaining Items

None. All critical and medium issues were addressed. The article is at 2531 words (84% of the 3000 soft threshold for topics), leaving room for future expansion without triggering length-neutral mode.

## Stability Notes

- The enactivism tension (enactivists reject the interface concept; the Map disagrees with their ontological conclusion while accepting phenomenological descriptions) is a bedrock philosophical disagreement, not a fixable flaw. Future reviews should NOT re-flag this.
- The epistemic concession about sensory substitution evidence (compatible with but not uniquely predicted by the interface reading) is a strength, not a weakness. Future reviews should NOT try to strengthen the evidential claim beyond what the data supports.
- The phantom limb section now honestly acknowledges that the interface reading and neural misfire account make the same empirical predictions. Future reviews should NOT try to manufacture differential predictions that don't exist.
