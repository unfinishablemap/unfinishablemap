title: 'Deep Review - The Responsibility Gradient: From Attentional Capacity to Moral
  Desert'
topics: []

**Date**: 2026-02-24
**Article**: [The Responsibility Gradient: From Attentional Capacity to Moral Desert](/topics/responsibility-gradient-from-attentional-capacity/)
**Previous review**: [2026-02-22](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-22-responsibility-gradient-from-attentional-capacity/)
**Review context**: Moral implications of genuine agency

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Style guide violation**: Opening paragraph used "This is not X. It is Y." construct, explicitly forbidden by writing-style.md as an overused LLM pattern. Resolution: Rephrased to make the positive claim directly ("The framework is a structural consequence of...").

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing upward gradient argument**: The article thoroughly covered how impaired attention diminishes responsibility but neglected the symmetric implication: genuine agency intensifies responsibility at full capacity beyond what determinism can ground. Resolution: Added a paragraph in "Against Binary Responsibility" articulating that full-capacity agents under genuine agency bear heavier moral weight than physicalism can assign.
- **Cross-link inconsistency**: `consciousness-and-causal-powers` appeared in frontmatter `related_articles` but was absent from Further Reading. Resolution: Added to Further Reading.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist**: "Attention" reifies folk psychology across distinct neural systems. *Bedrock disagreement from previous review—not re-flagged.*
- **Dennett-style physicalist**: Graded responsibility doesn't require dualism. *Bedrock disagreement from previous review—not re-flagged.* The new "upward gradient" paragraph strengthens the Map's distinctive contribution by showing genuine agency intensifies desert in a way physicalism cannot.
- **Quantum skeptic**: ~10 bits/s claim is information-theoretic, not necessarily quantum. *Tenet-level commitment from previous review—not re-flagged.*
- **MWI defender**: Desert under branching was adequately addressed in previous review's expansion.
- **Empiricist**: Framework adds no unique predictions beyond cognitive psychology. *Noted in previous review's remaining items; the new paragraph about intensified responsibility at full capacity provides a clearer differentiator.*
- **Buddhist philosopher**: Cultivation principle assumes persistent self. *Worldview difference per previous review—not re-flagged.*

### Attribution Accuracy Check
- Fischer & Ravizza (1998) characterization as "reasons-responsiveness theory" recognising degrees: **Accurate**
- Mullainathan & Shafir (2013) "13 IQ points" claim: **Accurate representation of source**
- No misattributions, dropped qualifiers, source/Map conflation, or self-contradictions detected

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Five-dimension framework (bandwidth, stability, scope, flexibility, availability) — genuine conceptual contribution
- Cultivation principle with three illustrative cases — excellent pedagogy
- Both tables (gradient and control-theoretic mapping) — clear and useful
- Opening summary — front-loads core claim, survives truncation
- All five tenet connections — comprehensive and well-argued
- Objections section — honest engagement with real concerns
- The gradient's floor principle — principled prevention of excuse-making
- Moral perception cross-link in Flexibility section (added in previous review)

### Enhancements Made
- Fixed LLM cliché ("This is not X. It is Y.") in opening paragraph
- Added "upward gradient" argument: genuine agency intensifies desert at full capacity, distinguishing the Map's framework from both compatibilism and hard determinism
- Added consciousness-and-causal-powers to Further Reading for cross-link consistency

### Cross-links Added
- [consciousness-and-causal-powers](/topics/consciousness-and-causal-powers/) (Further Reading)
- [agent-causation](/concepts/agent-causation/) (inline, in new paragraph)

## Remaining Items

- Uncited bibliography entries (Meister, Schwartz & Begley, Strawson, Kane) — low priority, deferred from previous review
- The "novel explanatory claim vs. cognitive psychology" distinction is now strengthened by the upward gradient argument but could be made even more explicit in future refinement

## Stability Notes

- All bedrock disagreements from the previous review remain stable: eliminative materialist objections, Dennett-style compatibilist alternatives, quantum skepticism, and Buddhist personal identity challenges are worldview differences, not fixable flaws. Future reviews should not re-flag these.
- The article is approaching stability after two reviews. The five-dimension framework, cultivation principle, and tenet connections are all strong. The main substantive addition this review made (upward gradient argument) fills a genuine gap rather than oscillating on previous changes.
- The "upward gradient" paragraph complements rather than contradicts the previous review's work on the compatibilism section. This is convergent improvement, not oscillation.
