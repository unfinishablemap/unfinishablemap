title: Deep Review - Princess Elisabeth's Challenge
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Article**: [Princess Elisabeth's Challenge](/topics/princess-elizabeths-challenge/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Stencil publication year wrong (2019 → 2023)**: The Eric Stencil article "Elisabeth of Bohemia on the Soul" in *Journal of Modern Philosophy* was published in 2023, not 2019. The "2019" in the DOI is an identifier number, not a publication date. **Resolution**: Corrected to 2023 with volume/issue added.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Quantum selection parallels Descartes' primitive-notions dodge**: The article criticised Descartes for asserting mind-body union as brute fact, yet the Map's own quantum selection response has a structurally similar quality—naming the interface without fully explaining it. **Resolution**: Added a candid acknowledgment paragraph explicitly noting the parallel and explaining why the Map's version is narrower (quantum mechanics independently identifies the gap).
- **"Selection is not contact" was a bare assertion**: The crux of the Map's response to Elisabeth was stated without justification. **Resolution**: Expanded to explain why selection among pre-existing possibilities differs from mechanical pushing (no energy/momentum transfer; resolves an indeterminacy physics leaves open).
- **Missing cross-link to delegatory-dualism**: The Relation to Site Perspective section discussed the Map's response without linking to the specific framework that develops it. **Resolution**: Added wikilink and brief description of delegatory-dualism.
- **Missing cross-link to substance-property-dualism in body**: Elisabeth's "naturalistic dualism" anticipates property dualism but the body text didn't link to the concept. **Resolution**: Added wikilink in Elisabeth's Alternative section.
- **Hasker attribution lacked citation**: William Hasker's emergent substance dualism was mentioned without a reference. **Resolution**: Added Hasker (1999) *The Emergent Self* to References.
- **Shapiro claim slightly overstated**: "The complete English translation" didn't acknowledge Andrea Nye's 1999 partial/embedded translation. **Resolution**: Changed to "first complete and unabridged English translation."

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative Materialist**: The vapors problem is presented honestly as genuinely challenging; the article does not overclaim the Map's response.
- **Quantum Skeptic**: The structural parallel between quantum selection and Descartes' brute-fact defence is now explicitly acknowledged.
- **Many-Worlds Defender**: Article does not engage MWI directly (appropriate—Elisabeth's challenge is about interaction, not interpretation).

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Three-layer decomposition of Elisabeth's challenge (causal interface, vapors, principal attribute)—goes well beyond standard treatments
- Recovery of Elisabeth as independent philosopher with her own positive position
- Strong opening paragraph: front-loads key claim, historically grounded, survives truncation
- Gravity analogy section is the article's strongest argumentative passage—crisp and decisive
- "Coherent but speculative" honesty about the Map's response to the vapors problem
- Elisabeth-to-Leibniz-to-Kim trajectory effectively shows the research programme her challenge launched

### Enhancements Made
- Expanded quantum selection justification with substantive argument (not just assertion)
- Added candid acknowledgment of Descartes parallel—improves intellectual honesty
- Cross-linked to [delegatory-dualism](/topics/delegatory-dualism/) (the Map's specific framework for answering Elisabeth)
- Cross-linked to [substance-property-dualism](/concepts/substance-property-dualism/) (Elisabeth's anticipation of contemporary positions)
- Added Hasker reference for proper scholarly grounding
- Corrected "collapse" to "decoherence" for more precise quantum mechanics terminology

### Cross-links Added
- [delegatory-dualism](/topics/delegatory-dualism/)
- [substance-property-dualism](/concepts/substance-property-dualism/) (in body text; was already in frontmatter)

## Remaining Items

None. All critical and medium issues were addressed in this review.

## Stability Notes

- Elisabeth's vapors problem is acknowledged as "genuinely challenging" for the Map's framework. This is an honest assessment, not a flaw to fix. Future reviews should not try to strengthen the Map's response beyond "coherent but speculative" without new philosophical resources.
- The structural parallel between quantum selection and Descartes' primitive notions is a permanent feature of the dialectic. The article now acknowledges it explicitly. Future reviews should not oscillate on whether to include or remove this acknowledgment.
- Adversarial personas will naturally find the Map's response to Elisabeth insufficient—this is expected philosophical disagreement, not a critical issue requiring further work.
