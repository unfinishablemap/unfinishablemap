## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Six adversarial philosopher personas examined the article:

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Unsupported claim about willed vs instructed attention** (Empiricist critique): The claim about distinct frontal theta coherence patterns lacked citation.
   - **Resolution**: Added citation (Anguera et al., 2013) and softened language to "Studies suggest..."

2. **Decoherence objection response too hand-wavy** (Quantum Skeptic critique): The original text acknowledged the Araujo et al. objection but then dismissed it without adequate development of the alternative proposal.
   - **Resolution**: Expanded the response into a separate paragraph, explicitly noting this shifts to "a different and less developed proposal than Stapp's original formulation"

3. **Libet experiments cited uncritically** (Hard-Nosed Physicalist critique): Eccles' reliance on Libet's temporal precedence findings was presented without noting the contested interpretation.
   - **Resolution**: Added note that "the interpretation of Libet's findings remains contested, with critics arguing the 'readiness potential' may reflect preparation for timing rather than the initiation of intention itself"

4. **Kerskens-Pérez study presented without epistemic humility** (Many-Worlds Defender critique): A single MRI study was cited as evidence for entanglement markers without noting it requires replication.
   - **Resolution**: Added "though this single study requires independent replication and has been met with skepticism regarding the interpretation of the MRI signal"

### Medium Issues Found

- Comparative table assessed Stapp's model as "High" development despite the Araujo challenge
  - **Resolution**: Changed to "High (but challenged)"
- Discussion of pairing problem lacked link to dedicated article
  - **Resolution**: Added links to [pairing-problem](/concepts/pairing-problem/)

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Eliminative Materialist**: The article assumes phenomenal properties exist as causal relata. This is acknowledged as working within the dualist framework per the tenets.
- **Buddhist Philosopher**: Critique of unified experiencer assumption. Not addressed—the Map operates within a framework that accepts phenomenal unity as real.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

Six supportive philosopher personas identified:

### Strengths Preserved

- Clear structural template (phenomenal property → physical selection → mechanism) throughout
- Honest acknowledgment that three of five mechanisms are underdeveloped
- Excellent comparative analysis table providing visual summary
- Strong tenet alignment in "Relation to Site Perspective" section
- Appropriate confidence calibration—doesn't overclaim

### Enhancements Made

- Expanded decoherence response with explicit acknowledgment of the mechanism shift
- Added epistemic markers throughout for contested claims
- Strengthened cross-linking to related concepts

### Cross-links Added

- [measurement-problem](/concepts/measurement-problem/)
- [voluntary-attention](/concepts/attention-as-interface/)
- [libet-experiments](/concepts/libet-experiments/)
- [pairing-problem](/concepts/pairing-problem/) (multiple instances)
- [phenomenal-consciousness](/concepts/phenomenal-consciousness/)
- [phenomenal-unity](/concepts/unity-of-consciousness/)
- [mysterianism](/concepts/mysterianism/)

- After: 2182 words (87% of 2500 soft threshold)
- Change: +149 words

## Remaining Items

None—all critical and medium issues addressed. The article now better reflects the contested status of the empirical evidence while maintaining its valuable structural clarity.
