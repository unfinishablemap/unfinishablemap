title: Deep Review - Philosophy of Mind
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-27
**Article**: [Philosophy of Mind](/concepts/philosophy-of-mind/)
**Previous review**: [2026-02-07](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-07-philosophy-of-mind/)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None. The article remains factually accurate, internally consistent, and structurally complete.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Duplicate `the-case-for-dualism`**: Appeared twice in both `related_articles` frontmatter and Further Reading section. **Resolution**: Removed duplicates from both locations.
2. **Orphan status — no inbound links**: The article linked extensively to 20+ concept and topic pages but received zero body-text links from any of them. For a field-overview article, this isolation meant readers of core concepts like consciousness, dualism, or qualia had no pathway to the broader field survey. **Resolution**: Added `[philosophy of mind](/concepts/philosophy-of-mind/)` cross-references to 9 core articles (see Cross-links Added below).
3. **No mention of non-Western philosophy of mind**: The article surveyed Western analytic philosophy exclusively without acknowledging this limitation. The site has an `indian-philosophy-of-mind` topic article. **Resolution**: Added a paragraph after the Alternative Frameworks section acknowledging Indian philosophical traditions and linking to the existing article.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminativist challenge** (Churchland): Adequately addressed in previous review; eliminativism is now mentioned in the Physicalism section. No re-flagging needed.
- **Born rule violation** (Tegmark): Acknowledged as open challenge in Dualism section. No re-flagging needed.
- **Buddhist no-self** (Nagarjuna): Competing worldview, not a flaw. Previous review classified this as bedrock disagreement.
- **MWI dissolution** (Deutsch): Handled by Tenet 4. Bedrock disagreement.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear, front-loaded opening summary with the field's central question stated in the first paragraph
- Well-organized structure: problems → positions → methods → site perspective
- Fair treatment of physicalism acknowledging its motivations before critiquing
- All five tenets explicitly mapped in Relation to Site Perspective with specific connections
- Appropriate article length (1449 → ~1500 words, well below 2500 soft threshold)
- Good cross-linking density throughout

### Enhancements Made
1. Added paragraph on non-Western (Indian) philosophy of mind traditions with link to existing article
2. Removed duplicate `the-case-for-dualism` from frontmatter and Further Reading
3. Added `indian-philosophy-of-mind` to related_articles and Further Reading
4. **Orphan integration**: Added 9 inbound cross-references from core articles (primary focus of this review)

### Cross-links Added (from other articles TO philosophy-of-mind)

- [problem-of-other-minds](/concepts/problem-of-other-minds/) — "One of philosophy of mind's oldest epistemological puzzles" replacing "philosophy's"

## Remaining Items

- The personal identity and problem of other minds subsections remain thin (one line each in the problems list). These were noted in the previous review and could be expanded in future, but the article's role as a field overview means brief treatment is appropriate.
- Process philosophy is not discussed as a distinct framework. Could be mentioned alongside panpsychism and Russellian monism in future.

## Stability Notes

- This article has reached good stability after two reviews. The content is well-structured, accurate, and appropriately scoped as a field overview.
- The adversarial personas' philosophical disagreements remain bedrock: eliminativists reject the hard problem's legitimacy, quantum skeptics cite decoherence, MWI defenders find Tenet 4 unmotivated, Buddhist philosophers see dualism as reification. These are expected disagreements, not flaws.
- The Born rule question remains an acknowledged open problem. Future reviews should not re-flag it.
- The primary value of this review was orphan integration rather than content improvement, reflecting the article's maturity.
