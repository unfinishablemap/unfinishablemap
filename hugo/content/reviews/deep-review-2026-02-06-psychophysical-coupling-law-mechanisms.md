## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

- **Misattributed citation (Araujo → Georgiev)**: The Monte Carlo simulation paper at arXiv:1412.4741 was attributed to "Araujo, I.S. et al. (2014)" in both body text and references. The actual author is Danko Georgiev (sole author), published in *International Journal of Modern Physics B* 29(7), 1550039 (2015). **Resolution**: Corrected author name in body text and full citation in references.

- **Incorrect journal citation (Zheng & Meister)**: Cited as *Neuron* 112(24) but the published version is *Neuron* 113(2), 192-204 (January 2025). **Resolution**: Corrected volume, issue, and page numbers.

### Medium Issues Found

- **Schwartz OCD evidence overstated**: The evidence was described as "attributable to directed mental effort rather than pharmacological intervention," creating a false dichotomy that excludes physicalist neuroplasticity explanations. The evidence is consistent with Stapp's model but not uniquely confirmatory. **Resolution**: Added explicit acknowledgment that the evidence is compatible with physicalist accounts.

- **Post-decoherence retreat presented too casually**: The shift from Zeno freezing to post-decoherence selection was presented as a straightforward fallback without acknowledging the significant loss of testability. **Resolution**: Added sentences noting the cost — fewer unique predictions and harder empirical distinction from stochastic accounts.

- **Beck vs. Popper attribution for Eccles**: The original text mentioned "earlier collaborative work with Karl Popper" in the context of the quantum tunneling mechanism, but the quantum mechanism was developed with Friedrich Beck (1991-1992), not Popper. Popper contributed to Eccles' general dualist philosophy. **Resolution**: Corrected to cite Beck as the collaborator on the quantum mechanism.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Eliminative Materialist**: Three of five candidates (60%) have no mechanism, and the two developed ones face serious objections. The article is an honest catalogue of the state of play. The tiering system already acknowledges this honestly — no change needed.

- **Physicalist neuroplasticity**: Schwartz evidence is multiply interpretable. Addressed by adding explicit acknowledgment.

- **Decoherence retreat unfalsifiable**: Post-decoherence selection generates fewer unique predictions. Addressed by adding cost acknowledgment.

- **MWI self-locating uncertainty**: The article's dismissal of MWI is brief but connects to the tenets. Could be expanded but is appropriate for the scope of this article.

- **Specification threshold coherence**: Whether any dualist mechanism could meet the specification threshold if phenomenal states are non-physical. This is a genuine philosophical challenge but beyond the scope of this mechanism-focused article.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- **Three-requirement specification threshold**: An excellent analytical framework (phenomenal variable, physical parameter, causal pathway) that raises the bar for mechanism proposals.
- **Three-tier system**: Honest intellectual cartography grading candidates by development level.
- **Pain asymbolia example**: Powerful clinical evidence that phenomenal quality does causal work.
- **Convergence problem section**: Philosophically sophisticated recognition that the five-candidate decomposition may not correspond to reality's joints.
- **Balanced treatment of decoherence**: Acknowledges the objection's force while noting possible responses.
- **Relation to Site Perspective**: Well-structured, connects each tenet to the mechanistic landscape.

### Enhancements Made

- Strengthened epistemic honesty around Schwartz OCD evidence
- Made the cost of the decoherence retreat explicit
- Fixed two citation errors that would have undermined credibility
- Corrected collaborator attribution for Eccles' quantum mechanism

### Cross-links Added

No new cross-links needed — the article already has thorough cross-linking to psychophysical-coupling, selection-laws, psychophysical-laws-framework, stapp-quantum-mind, decoherence, mental-effort, and tenets.

## Remaining Items

- The Araujo → Georgiev misattribution also appears in `obsidian/concepts/psychophysical-coupling.md` and `obsidian/concepts/coupling-modes.md`. These should be corrected in future reviews of those files.
- The article could eventually discuss whether Stapp's later work addresses the decoherence timescale more directly, but this is an expansion opportunity rather than a current gap.

## Stability Notes

- MWI proponents will always find the anti-MWI argument unsatisfying. This is a bedrock disagreement grounded in the tenets, not a flaw to fix.
- Physicalists will always note that the neuroplasticity evidence doesn't require Stapp's quantum mechanism. The article now acknowledges this explicitly. Future reviews should not re-flag this as critical — it is an expected philosophical standoff.
- The three Tier 3 candidates lack mechanisms by design at this stage of the field. Flagging their underdevelopment as a "problem" misses that the article itself presents this as the honest state of play.
