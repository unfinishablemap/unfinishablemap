title: Deep Review - Mental Causation
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Article**: [Mental Causation](/concepts/mental-causation/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-29](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-29-mental-causation/)
**Word count**: 2933 → 2918 (-15, length-neutral)
**Context**: Cross-review considering choking phenomenon insights

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article remains stable from previous reviews.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing reference to choking phenomenon**: The self-stultification section provided the main positive evidence for mental causation, but the Map now has empirically-grounded evidence via the choking phenomenon article. [RESOLVED: Added brief reference to choking as complementary empirical evidence]

### Counterarguments Considered
All six adversarial personas engaged:
- Eliminative materialist: Illusionism section adequate; no new concerns
- Hard-nosed physicalist: Heterophenomenology engaged via Tallis; delegatory dualism integrated in previous review
- Quantum skeptic: Decoherence section addresses Tegmark (2000) appropriately
- MWI defender: Philosophical standoff remains (bedrock disagreement per stability notes)
- Empiricist: Now strengthened with choking phenomenon reference—article has improved empirical grounding
- Buddhist philosopher: No specific concerns

### Attribution Accuracy Check
- Kim's exclusion argument: Correctly attributed
- Saad's delegatory dualism: Correctly characterized
- Stapp's proposal: Correctly described
- Lowe's agent causation: Correctly characterized
- Tallis quote: Properly cited
- No misattributions detected

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Self-stultification argument: Clear, epistemically powerful
- Kim's exclusion argument presentation: Fair and comprehensive
- Quantum opening explanation: Accessible without oversimplifying
- Agent causation section: Good phenomenological grounding
- Falsifiability conditions: Demonstrates epistemic humility
- Delegatory dualism integration: Properly connected to Map's quantum framework

### Enhancements Made
- Added reference to [choking-phenomenon-mental-causation](/topics/choking-phenomenon-mental-causation/) in self-stultification section
- Added choking phenomenon article to Further Reading
- Trimmed Further Reading (removed reductionism, downward-causation, pairing-problem to maintain length neutrality)
- Consolidated bullet list in self-stultification section to make room for choking reference

### Cross-links Added
- [choking-phenomenon-mental-causation](/topics/choking-phenomenon-mental-causation/) (self-stultification section, Further Reading)

## Remaining Items

None. The article integrates the new choking phenomenon evidence while maintaining length neutrality.

## Stability Notes

This is the fourth deep review. The article remains stable:

- **The MWI objection** remains a philosophical standoff—Many-Worlds defenders will find the indexical argument unsatisfying. Bedrock disagreement, not a flaw.

- **The decoherence objection** is acknowledged as genuinely challenging while noting it doesn't solve the measurement problem.

- **The illusionist challenge** is engaged adequately. The regress problem remains the standard response.

- **The specification problem** is properly connected to the psychophysical-laws-framework.

- **The choking phenomenon** is now referenced as empirical evidence complementing the self-stultification argument. The new article provides negative evidence (interference that cannot be confabulated) alongside the epistemological argument.

- **Further Reading trimmed**: Removed three links (reductionism, downward-causation, pairing-problem) that are less directly relevant than the remaining links. These concepts are still linked from the body text or concepts frontmatter.

The article is at 117% of soft threshold. No further expansion warranted; future reviews should focus on accuracy and connection maintenance.
