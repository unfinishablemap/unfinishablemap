**Article**: [Integrated Information Theory](/concepts/integrated-information-theory/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Missing falsifiability section**: Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section with four testable predictions and assessment of site's critique
- **IIT 4.0 incomplete**: Added reference to IIT 4.0's sixth consideration (temporal structure)

### Medium Issues Found
- **No process philosophy connection**: Added "Process Philosophy Resonance" subsection comparing Whitehead's actual occasions to IIT
- **Illusionism response underdeveloped**: Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section with IIT's response and counter-response
- **Missing decoherence connection**: Enhanced quantum section with Kerskens & Pérez (2022) entanglement study
- **Binding problem not connected**: Added explanation of how IIT claims to dissolve binding problem
- **Substrate-dependence not linked**: Added functionalism cross-link

### Counterarguments Considered
- Illusionist challenge that phenomenal integration doesn't exist
- Process philosophy alternative (Whitehead)
- Whether IIT's identity thesis precludes causal efficacy

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear axiom-to-postulate-to-implication structure
- Fair treatment of IIT as serious competitor theory
- Good coverage of COGITATE experiment results
- Balanced assessment acknowledging both frameworks' merits

### Enhancements Made
- Added "The Illusionist Challenge" subsection engaging Frankish/Dennett
- Added "Process Philosophy Resonance" subsection with Whitehead comparison
- Added "What Would Challenge This View?" falsifiability section
- Enhanced quantum section with recent entanglement research
- Added binding problem connection in substrate section
- Expanded concepts frontmatter with 5 new cross-links
- Expanded Further Reading with 5 new links
- Added 4 new references (Kerskens & Pérez, Frankish, Whitehead, plus IEP)

### Cross-links Added
- [phenomenal-unity](/concepts/phenomenal-unity/) (in axioms and Further Reading)
- [binding-problem](/concepts/binding-problem/) (in substrate section and Further Reading)
- [illusionism](/concepts/illusionism/) (new section and Further Reading)
- [emergence](/concepts/emergence/) (Further Reading)
- [functionalism](/arguments/functionalism/) (in substrate section and Further Reading)
