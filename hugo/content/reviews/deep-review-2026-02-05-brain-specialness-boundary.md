**Article**: [The Brain Specialness Problem: Why Not Psychokinesis?](/topics/brain-specialness-boundary/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Six adversarial personas examined this article for logical gaps, unsupported claims, and potential counterarguments.

### Critical Issues Found
None.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Stapp quote lacked citation**: The quote "Prior to the choice to act there must be a representation in the brain of the intended consequences" was attributed to Stapp without citation.
   - **Resolution**: Added citation "(Stapp, 2007)"

2. **Decoherence challenge not acknowledged in main text**: The article references the quantum Zeno mechanism without noting that decoherence in warm biological tissue remains contested.
   - **Resolution**: Added parenthetical note after Interface Locality section acknowledging the decoherence debate and linking to [decoherence](/concepts/decoherence/), while noting external systems face even more severe challenges plus lack integration requirements.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist**: Questions whether "consciousness" is a valid category. (Bedrock disagreement with dualism tenet—not fixable)
- **Hard-nosed physicalist**: Argues the mechanism is physical processes all the way down. (Bedrock disagreement with dualism tenet—not fixable)
- **Quantum skeptic**: Tegmark's decoherence calculations apply to internal as well as external systems. (Addressed with added note)
- **MWI defender**: Article's dismissal of MWI too quick. (Bedrock disagreement with No Many Worlds tenet—not fixable)
- **Empiricist**: Verified PEAR dates and effect sizes against cited sources—accurate.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

Six sympathetic personas identified strengths and opportunities.

### Strengths Preserved
1. The "mechanism, not restriction" framing—captures the key insight elegantly
2. The four-constraint structure (interface locality, control loop integration, developmental integration, attention scope)—clear, systematic, philosophically rigorous
3. Treatment of PEAR as confirming the framework's *negative* prediction—clever reversal
4. Honest engagement with parapsychology without dismissiveness or defensiveness
5. Comprehensive "Relation to Site Perspective" connecting to all five tenets
6. Intellectually honest "What Would Challenge This View" section

### Enhancements Made
1. Added citation for Stapp quote
2. Added brief acknowledgment of decoherence debate with cross-link

### Cross-links Added
- [decoherence](/concepts/decoherence/) (new cross-link in parenthetical)

## Remaining Items

None. The article is well-constructed and addresses its topic comprehensively.

## Stability Notes

The adversarial personas raised philosophical objections that represent fundamental disagreements with the Map's tenets rather than fixable flaws:
- Eliminativists and hard physicalists will always find the framework question-begging against their position
- MWI defenders will always find the "No Many Worlds" assumption problematic
- These are bedrock disagreements, not issues to "fix" in future reviews
