# Deep Review: Neural Quantum Coherence

**Date**: 2026-01-25
**File**: `obsidian/concepts/neural-quantum-coherence.md`
**Previous review**: 2026-01-19

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None. The article was already in good shape from the previous review.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Unclear source for 2025 simulation**: The "2025 simulation" estimating 1-2 microseconds coherence was not explicitly attributed. **Resolution**: Clarified as Wiest et al. (2025) computational study and noted these are theoretical corrections, not direct measurements.
- **Unsupported lithium isotope claim**: "Preliminary evidence shows lithium isotope effects in rat behaviour" lacked citations. **Resolution**: Added specific references to the 1986 Cornell maternal behaviour study and the 2025 multi-electrode array experiments on rat brain slices, with quote about "large and opposite effects on synaptic transmission."

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist**: Would question whether "consciousness" is a coherent natural kind. The article appropriately hedges with "None of this proves that quantum effects cause consciousness."
- **Dennettian physicalist**: Would question the reality of "unified experience." Article treats phenomenal unity as real, consistent with Map tenets.
- **Tegmark/quantum skeptic**: Article directly addresses the decoherence objection with revised estimates. Now clarifies these are theoretical corrections rather than experimental measurements.
- **MWI defender**: Previous review noted this as expansion opportunity; remains unaddressed but appropriate for a coherence-focused article.
- **Empiricist**: Key predictions now have proper citations. Kerskens-Pérez study appropriately hedged about replication needs.
- **Buddhist philosopher**: Metaphysical framework difference, not article flaw.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear, front-loaded opening summary that survives truncation
- Well-organized comparison table of coherence estimates
- Four protective mechanisms systematically explained
- Appropriate confidence calibration throughout
- Comprehensive tenet connection addressing all five tenets
- Effective "What Coherence Does Not Require" section distinguishing mechanisms
- Good balance between presenting evidence and maintaining epistemic humility

### Enhancements Made
- Clarified that Hagan et al. (2002) figures are theoretical corrections, not experimental measurements
- Expanded lithium isotope evidence from vague "preliminary evidence" to specific 1986 and 2025 studies
- Added Fisher et al. (2025) to References section

### Cross-links Present
- [binding-problem](/concepts/binding-problem/), [quantum-consciousness](/concepts/quantum-consciousness/), [decoherence](/concepts/decoherence/), [quantum-biology](/concepts/quantum-biology/), [measurement-problem](/concepts/measurement-problem/), [quantum-coherence-protection](/concepts/quantum-coherence-protection/), [tenets](/tenets/), research notes

## Remaining Items

None. The article now has proper citations for all factual claims and appropriate epistemic hedging throughout.

## Stability Notes

This article is approaching stability. The previous review (2026-01-19) addressed major structural issues (missing MRI entanglement evidence, twin study, binding-problem cross-link). This review addressed minor citation gaps. Future reviews should NOT re-flag:

- **Philosophical disagreements with adversarial personas**: The eliminativist, physicalist, and MWI positions are expected to disagree with dualist content. This is by design, not a flaw.
- **"Correlation not causation" concerns**: The article already explicitly states "None of this proves that quantum effects cause consciousness."
- **MWI implications**: The article is about neural quantum coherence, not quantum interpretation debates. The tenet connection briefly notes the Map's MWI rejection; this is sufficient.
