title: Deep Review - Agent Causation (Cross-Review for Causal Interface)
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Article**: [Agent Causation](/concepts/agent-causation/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-30 (evening, third review)](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-30-agent-causation/)
**Context**: Cross-review considering causal-interface.md insights

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. Article remains stable after three prior reviews.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing cross-link to causal-interface**: The causal-interface.md voids article directly explains why we cannot observe how agent causation works—the "double opacity" from first-person and third-person perspectives. This is highly relevant since agent-causation.md asserts consciousness interfaces with physics at quantum indeterminacies but didn't acknowledge the systematic invisibility of this interface. [Resolution: Added paragraph in "Substance Causation and the Map's Framework" section, frontmatter cross-link, and Further Reading entry]

### Counterarguments Considered
All six persona objections are bedrock disagreements previously documented:
- **Eliminative materialist**: Rejects "consciousness" as natural kind exercising causal powers
- **Heterophenomenologist**: Questions phenomenology as metaphysical evidence
- **Quantum skeptic**: Article acknowledges decoherence challenge; causal-interface addition strengthens response by explaining why opacity is predicted
- **Many-worlds defender**: Appropriately listed as falsifier
- **Buddhist philosopher**: Whitehead section provides alternative framing
- **Empiricist**: Falsifiability section remains strong

### Attribution Check
All philosopher citations verified:
- Chisholm's immanent/transeunt distinction: accurate
- O'Connor's substance causation: accurate
- Lowe's position on substances as causal sources: accurate
- Hasker's emergent dualism: accurate
- Kane's 2024 evolution: appropriately characterized
- Schurger, Sjöberg, Desmurget: empirical claims accurately stated

No attribution errors.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Two-domain convergence argument (attention + motor selection)
- Kane's sourcehood treatment and retrocausal deepening
- Creative generation section (beyond pure selection)
- Comprehensive falsifiability list with six specific conditions
- Skill delegation/choking evidence
- Substance causation reframing of causal closure objection
- Authentic-vs-inauthentic-choice integration from previous review

### Enhancements Made
1. **Added causal-interface cross-link**: Integrated the causal interface void's insight that the mechanism's invisibility is *predicted* by minimal quantum interaction—a minimal influence leaves minimal traces
2. **Reframed opacity as feature**: The new paragraph explains that systematic invisibility is not an embarrassment but a consequence of the interface being small enough to avoid violating conservation laws
3. **Updated Further Reading**: Added entry pointing to why agent causation's mechanism is systematically invisible

### Cross-links Added
- [causal-interface](/voids/causal-interface/)

## Remaining Items

None. This cross-review integrated the causal-interface content appropriately.

## Stability Notes

This is the fourth review of this article. The article has reached excellent stability:
- First review (2026-01-20): Initial comprehensive review
- Second review (2026-01-30 morning): Found no critical issues
- Third review (2026-01-30 evening): Cross-review for authentic-vs-inauthentic-choice
- Fourth review (2026-01-31): Cross-review for causal-interface

Each subsequent review has found only natural cross-linking opportunities to new content rather than issues with the core article.

Bedrock philosophical disagreements remain:
- Eliminativists reject "consciousness" as a natural kind exercising causal powers
- Heterophenomenologists question reliance on phenomenology as metaphysical evidence
- MWI proponents reject collapse-based frameworks
- Buddhist philosophers question substantial self

These are fundamental philosophical disagreements. The article engages them fairly. Future reviews should not re-flag these as critical issues.
