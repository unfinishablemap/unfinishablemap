title: Deep Review - The Phenomenology of Normative Experience
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-25
**Article**: [The Phenomenology of Normative Experience](/topics/phenomenology-of-normative-experience/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Broken link**: `contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness-theories` referenced at two locations; file was archived and renamed to `contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness`. Fixed both occurrences.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Functionalist dismissal too quick**: The article claimed shared phenomenal architecture is "surprising" on functionalist accounts, but functionalism predicts shared *functional* architecture across domains. Resolution: Rewrote to acknowledge the functionalist response, then distinguish phenomenal from functional shared structure — the key evidence is shared *qualitative* character, not shared processing.
- **Computationalist dismissal underdeveloped**: "Fails to account for several features" listed features without explaining why computational models specifically can't model them. Resolution: Rewrote to concede that computation can model oscillation and attention, then pinpoint what it cannot capture — the first-person character of commitment and the experience of deliberation not determining the outcome. Added cross-link to [phenomenology-of-choice](/concepts/phenomenology-of-choice/).
- **MQI tenet connection too vague**: "May represent a case where the stakes of that influence are highest" was a bare possibility claim. Resolution: Rewrote with more substance — normative adjudication is where the agent's commitment must translate into one physical action rather than another at a juncture where demands underdetermine the outcome. Added cross-link to [mental-effort](/concepts/mental-effort/).
- **Uncited references**: Chudnoff (2013), Kriegel (2015), and Murdoch (1970) appear in References but are not cited in text. Deferred — these serve as background reading and this is acceptable practice for a references section.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Functionalism predicts shared functional architecture**: Addressed by distinguishing shared functional structure (which functionalism predicts) from shared phenomenal/qualitative structure (which it does not predict and which phenomenal normativity explains more directly).
- **Computationalist models of deliberation**: Addressed by conceding what computation can model (oscillation, attention dynamics) and identifying what it cannot (first-person character of commitment, the leap of choice).
- **Eliminative materialist challenge to introspective reports**: Not addressed in the article — this is a standing challenge to all phenomenological work, not specific to this article.
- **Buddhist anti-essentialism about normative properties**: The article acknowledges the tension in one clause. Adequate for now; the Map acknowledges rather than resolves this tension.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Four-domain taxonomy (moral, epistemic, aesthetic, prudential) with distinct phenomenal signatures — clear and philosophically rigorous
- Concrete examples: whistleblower (cross-domain conflict), Agamemnon (tragic dilemma), Riefenstahl (aesthetic-moral tension)
- Temporal structure of conflict (onset-deliberation-resolution-aftermath) — phenomenologically rich and original
- Agent-causation connection through normative arbitration — strong argumentative chain
- Moral residue argument via Williams — well-developed and correctly attributed
- No Many Worlds tenet connection — strongest of the five tenet connections
- Opening summary — well-crafted, front-loads the key claim, truncation-resilient

### Enhancements Made
- Strengthened functionalist engagement: now distinguishes phenomenal from functional shared architecture
- Sharpened computationalist response: concedes what computation can model, pinpoints what it cannot
- Made MQI tenet connection substantive: now explains *why* normative adjudication is a candidate for quantum-level influence
- Added cross-link to [phenomenology-of-choice](/concepts/phenomenology-of-choice/) at the resolution-as-leap discussion
- Added cross-link to [mental-effort](/concepts/mental-effort/) in the MQI tenet paragraph
- Fixed broken link to [contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness](/topics/contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness/) (2 locations)
- Tightened prose in demand-character, resistance-to-preference, epistemic normativity, and cross-domain conflict sections to maintain length neutrality

### Cross-links Added
- [phenomenology-of-choice](/concepts/phenomenology-of-choice/)
- [mental-effort](/concepts/mental-effort/)
- [contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness](/topics/contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness/) (fixed from broken link)

## Remaining Items

- Uncited references (Chudnoff, Kriegel, Murdoch) — these serve as background reading; low priority
- Buddhist engagement could be deepened in a future review if the article is substantially modified

## Stability Notes

- The eliminative materialist and Dennettian heterophenomenology challenges apply to *all* phenomenological work, not specifically to this article. Future reviews should not flag "introspective reports are unreliable" as a critical issue — it is a bedrock philosophical disagreement between phenomenological and eliminativist approaches.
- Buddhist anti-essentialism about normative properties is acknowledged in the article as a tension. This is a genuine philosophical difference that the Map notes rather than resolves.
- The Quantum Skeptic's objection that the MQI connection is speculative applies to all MQI tenet connections across the site — it is not specific to this article.
