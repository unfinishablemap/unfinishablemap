title: Deep Review - Attentional Economics
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Article**: [Attentional Economics](/concepts/attentional-economics/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None identified. The article is well-constructed with appropriate hedging on speculative mechanisms and accurate tenet connections.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Bischof-Köhler hypothesis uncited**: The claim about animals' inability to act on non-current drive states lacked citation. *Resolution*: Added Suddendorf & Corballis 2007 citation.
- **Great ape WM capacity uncited**: The "2±1 items" claim lacked inline citation. *Resolution*: Added Inoue & Matsuzawa 2007 citation.
- **"Literal force" claim underargued**: The assertion that economic concepts have "literal force" in the framework could use support. *Resolution*: Added sentence specifying that scarcity is genuine, trade-offs are real, and returns are measurable.
- **Missing cross-links**: Counterfactual reasoning was mentioned but not linked. *Resolution*: Added counterfactual-reasoning wikilink. (Note: moral-luck was initially added but later removed as no such article exists.)

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Churchland/Dennett (functionalist)**: "Felt effort" could be explained by neural competition without non-physical causation. The article's response via the argument from reason and Zeno mechanism is appropriate; this remains a bedrock philosophical disagreement, not a flaw to fix.
- **Tegmark (quantum skeptic)**: Decoherence objections apply. The article appropriately hedges with "if it's the mechanism" and defers detailed decoherence treatment to linked articles.
- **MWI defender**: Selection might be indexical even under MWI. The article's response is brief but adequate—the phenomenology of genuine selection presupposes alternatives.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- **Novel reframing**: Agency as sustained attention allocation rather than discrete decisions—sidesteps libertarian/determinist binary
- **Economic table**: Effective conceptual mapping (scarcity, allocation, investment, return, opportunity cost)
- **Phenomenology section**: Accurate, detailed, epistemically appropriate treatment of felt alternatives, selection effort, opportunity awareness, investment temporality
- **Moral responsibility nuance**: Scaling without elimination; character cultivation as agency; structural factors
- **Three-level structure**: Sophisticated treatment of selection, witness mode, and meta-level agency
- **Appropriate hedging**: Quantum mechanisms speculative but coherently integrated

### Enhancements Made
- Strengthened "literal force" claim with concrete support
- Added [counterfactual-reasoning](/concepts/counterfactual-reasoning/) cross-link in distal intentions passage
- Removed `moral-luck` cross-link (article does not exist; moral luck mentioned as plain text)
- Added citations for Bischof-Köhler hypothesis and great ape WM capacity
- Added two new references to References section

### Cross-links Added
- [counterfactual-reasoning](/concepts/counterfactual-reasoning/)

### Cross-links Removed
- `moral-luck` (article does not exist)

## Remaining Items

None. All identified medium issues have been addressed.

## Stability Notes

The adversarial personas' philosophical disagreements (functionalist, MWI defender) represent expected standoffs rather than fixable problems. Future reviews should NOT re-flag:
- "Functionalist alternative explanation not refuted" — This is a bedrock disagreement about consciousness; the article engages it appropriately.
- "MWI indexical response not developed" — The brief treatment is sufficient for a concepts article; detailed MWI engagement belongs in [many-worlds](/arguments/many-worlds/).

The article is now in good shape for its first review cycle.
