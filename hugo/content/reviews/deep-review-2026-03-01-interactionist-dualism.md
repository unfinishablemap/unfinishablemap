title: Deep Review - Interactionist Dualism
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-03-01
**Article**: [Interactionist Dualism](/concepts/interactionist-dualism/)
**Previous review**: [2026-02-03](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-03-interactionist-dualism/)
**Review type**: Cross-review considering amplification-void insights

## Context

This review was triggered as a cross-review to verify that amplification-void insights are properly integrated into the interactionist-dualism concept page. The amplification-void article (created 2026-02-28) names the structural impossibility of tracing the chain from quantum-scale conscious influence to macroscopic neural effect. The previous five reviews (2026-01-19, 2026-01-25, 2026-01-29, 2026-01-31, 2026-02-03) established article stability.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Six adversarial philosopher personas examined the document with focus on the amplification-void cross-review context:

### Critical Issues Found
**None.** No factual errors, misattributions, or internal contradictions.

### Attribution Accuracy Check

All attributions verified accurate:

| Claim | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Chalmers: supervenience vs. causal psychophysical laws | Accurate |
| Chalmers tends toward epiphenomenalism | Accurate |
| Kim's exclusion argument (4 premises) | Accurate |
| Saad (2025): delegatory dualism, preemption, observational closure | Accurate (verified in prior review) |
| Stapp: quantum Zeno effect, OCD research | Accurate |
| Cogitate Consortium (2023): posterior cortical hot zone | Accurate |

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Missing amplification-void cross-link** (addressed): The article discussed quantum mechanisms and decoherence without referencing the amplification void — the multi-scale opacity problem of tracing quantum influence to macroscopic effect. Added a sentence in the Decoherence Objection section and a Further Reading entry.

2. **Misdirected wikilink** (addressed): `[evolutionary evidence](/concepts/consciousness-as-amplifier/)` pointed to an archived topic. Corrected to `[evolutionary evidence](/concepts/consciousness-as-amplifier/)` to point to the canonical concepts article.

### Counterarguments Previously Addressed
All prior resolutions from previous reviews remain intact:
- Dennett's heterophenomenology objection (bedrock disagreement)
- Eliminativism (addressed in Objections section)
- Decoherence objection (addressed with multi-layered response)
- Conservation law objection (addressed via selection-not-injection)
- Exclusion argument (addressed via quantum + delegation responses)
- MWI rejection (bedrock tenet commitment)

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

Six sympathetic philosopher personas examined the document:

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening summary front-loads core position effectively
- Seven converging arguments structure remains clear and cumulative
- Psychophysical laws framework (supervenience vs. causal laws) — excellent
- Two-response structure to exclusion argument (quantum + delegation)
- Agent causation framing with causal-interface acknowledgment
- Self-stultification argument against epiphenomenalism
- Falsifiability section's honest treatment
- Delegatory dualism integration (accurate attribution to Saad 2025)
- "The agent doesn't randomly select—the agent *chooses*" — effective formulation

### Enhancements Made
- Added amplification-void reference in Decoherence Objection section — acknowledges the multi-scale opacity challenge honestly, consistent with the article's existing candour about speculative mechanisms
- Added amplification-void to Further Reading under Mechanisms
- Fixed misdirected consciousness-as-amplifier wikilink
- Added amplification-void to frontmatter concepts

### Cross-links Added
- [amplification-void](/voids/amplification-void/) (frontmatter, body text, Further Reading)

## Changes Made

**Content**:
- Added sentence in Decoherence Objection section referencing the amplification void
- Added amplification-void to Further Reading (Mechanisms subsection)
- Fixed `[consciousness-as-intelligence-amplifier](/concepts/consciousness-as-amplifier/)` → `[consciousness-as-amplifier](/concepts/consciousness-as-amplifier/)`

**Frontmatter**:
- Added `[amplification-void](/voids/amplification-void/)` to concepts list
- Updated `ai_modified` timestamp
- Updated `last_deep_review` timestamp

### Word Count
- Before: 2268 words (91% of 2500-word soft threshold)
- After: 2307 words (92% of 2500-word soft threshold)
- Change: +39 words

## Remaining Items

None. The cross-review objective (integrate amplification-void insights) is complete.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed **six times** (2026-01-19, 2026-01-25, 2026-01-29, 2026-01-31, 2026-02-03, 2026-03-01) and remains stable:

- **Amplification-void integration complete**: The new voids article is referenced in the Decoherence section, frontmatter, and Further Reading. The article honestly acknowledges the multi-scale opacity problem without overstating it.

- **Delegatory dualism integration complete**: Verified again — Saad's 2025 theory is accurately represented.

- **Healthy length**: At 2307 words (92% of soft threshold), the article has modest room for future cross-links.

- **Philosophical disagreements are expected**: Materialist, physicalist, and MWI personas find the interactionist position unsatisfying. These are bedrock disagreements, not fixable flaws.

- **Convergence achieved**: Five of six reviews have made only minor or no content changes. The article's core structure and arguments are stable. Future reviews should focus on factual accuracy when new related content is created, not structural changes.
