title: Deep Review - Atemporal Causation
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-17
**Article**: [Atemporal Causation](/concepts/atemporal-causation/)
**Previous review**: Never (first deep review; pessimistic review on 2026-02-14 led to "Removing an Objection" section)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Internal contradiction between mechanism claims and mechanism ignorance**: The "Not violation of physical law" section asserted "no conservation law is broken" as fact while the "Removing an Objection" section admits the mechanism is unknown. Cannot claim specific properties for an admittedly unknown mechanism. **Resolution**: Added conditional framing ("If it works as proposed") and forward-reference to the explanatory limits section.

### Medium Issues Found
- **"Two frameworks in quantum mechanics make atemporal causation precise"** conflated physics with interpretation. **Resolution**: Changed to "Two interpretive frameworks within quantum mechanics give atemporal causation mathematical form" and noted their minority status.
- **ABL 1964 "requires" overstated**: Claimed complete physical description *requires* two state vectors; ABL showed this for post-selected ensembles specifically. **Resolution**: Qualified to "for quantum systems with both pre-selection and post-selection."
- **Kastner PTI presented uncritically**: No mention of contested status or Maudlin challenge. **Resolution**: Added note about Maudlin's objection and contested status.
- **"Atemporal causation satisfies both" lacked forward-reference**: Confident assertion in "Application to Consciousness" before the qualifying "Removing an Objection" section. **Resolution**: Added "though as the section on explanatory limits discusses" qualifier.
- **"Brain enters quantum superposition" unqualified**: The decoherence challenge was unaddressed for this step. **Resolution**: Added parenthetical noting this is the most contested step with link to quantum-consciousness.
- **Aquinas hand-and-staff analogy misframed**: Analogy illustrates simultaneous causation, not atemporal causation; the article's extension was presented as Aquinas's claim. **Resolution**: Distinguished Aquinas's own concern (simultaneity) from the Map's reading (pointing toward atemporality).
- **Occam's Razor section equivocated** between well-established equations and contested interpretations. **Resolution**: Distinguished "time-symmetric equations" (well-established) from "interpretive frameworks" (mathematically developed but not widely adopted).
- **TSVF "makes atemporality mathematically explicit"** overstated. **Resolution**: Changed to "makes time-symmetry mathematically explicit, and on the Map's reading, points toward atemporality."
- **Modified growing block didn't address** how merely possible absorbers can participate in transactions. **Resolution**: Added paragraph noting Kastner's possibilist ontology gives possibilities genuine status.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Conceptual coherence of "atemporal determination"**: If "determination" is inherently temporal, can atemporal causation be stated without self-contradiction? Noted as a philosophical tension but not addressed in this pass — the concept article is already honest about explanatory limits and this is a deeper metaphysical puzzle.
- **Empiricist challenge (no distinguishing experiment)**: The article lacks a "What Would Challenge This View?" section present on sibling articles. Deferred as a follow-up task — adding it would require careful thought about what conditions would count against the framework.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- **Opening paragraph**: Extraordinary compression — defines concept, distinguishes from ordinary causation, connects to Map framework, motivates Libet dissolution in three sentences
- **Retrocausal/atemporal distinction**: "Retrocausality describes the physics... Atemporal causation describes the metaphysics" — clean conceptual knife-cut justifying the article's existence
- **"What Atemporal Causation Is Not" section**: Four precise negative definitions preventing common misunderstandings
- **"Removing an Objection Is Not Providing a Mechanism"**: All six pessimistic and optimistic personas praised this section's intellectual honesty
- **The "where/what/how" taxonomy**: Memorable analytical framework calibrating the article's claims precisely
- **Modified growing block integration**: Elegantly resolves apparent conflict with rejection of eternalism
- **Relation to Site Perspective**: Connects all five tenets with genuine substance

### Enhancements Made
- Added inline cross-link to [phenomenology-of-choice](/concepts/phenomenology-of-choice/) in the Application to Consciousness section
- Cited Price (2012) in the body text (was previously in References but uncited)
- Removed stale AI refinement log comment
- Added Plotinus qualifier about necessary emanation vs selective determination

### Cross-links Added
- [phenomenology-of-choice](/concepts/phenomenology-of-choice/) (inline in Application to Consciousness)
- [quantum-consciousness](/concepts/quantum-consciousness/) (inline in step 1 of the selection mechanism)

## Remaining Items

- **"What Would Challenge This View?" section**: The article lacks falsifiability conditions present on sibling articles (retrocausality, time-symmetric-selection-mechanism). Should be added in a future pass.
- **Inbound links**: The article has zero inbound links from active content articles. High-priority targets for future cross-review: retrocausality, time-symmetric-selection-mechanism, collapse-and-time, agent-causation, interactionist-dualism.
- **Free will implications**: The article touches free will through Libet but doesn't develop implications for sourcehood or the luck objection. Could warrant a short subsection.
- **Phenomenology expansion**: The phenomenological argument in "Application to Consciousness" is thin relative to its importance. Could draw more from phenomenology-of-choice.

## Stability Notes

- The empiricist objection ("what experiment distinguishes this from quantum randomness?") is a bedrock challenge that applies to all interpretations of quantum mechanics, not a fixable flaw specific to this article. Future reviews should note this as a philosophical standoff rather than re-flagging it as critical.
- The eliminative materialist charge of "metaphysical escapism" has been adequately addressed by the "Removing an Objection" section. The article's honesty about the explanatory gap is a feature, not a weakness. Future reviews should not re-flag this.
- The quantum skeptic's concern about physics doing "rhetorical work" for the metaphysical claim has been substantially addressed by distinguishing equations from interpretations and qualifying the TSVF and TI claims. The remaining gap — that consciousness's role is postulated rather than derived from the physics — is the core commitment of the Map's framework, not an error to correct.
