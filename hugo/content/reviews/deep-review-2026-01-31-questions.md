**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Article**: [Open Questions](/questions/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Missing description in frontmatter**: Required for SEO/social per style guide. Resolution: Added description capturing the section's purpose.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Ambiguous wikilink**: `[consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns](/questions/consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns/)` could resolve to either concepts/ or questions/ versions. Resolution: Added display text to clarify link intent.
- **Section appears underdeveloped**: Only one question listed. Deferred: Expanding section requires creating new discussion pages (out of scope for this review).
- **No link to tenets**: Opening mentions "foundational tenets" without linking. Resolution: Added `[tenets](/tenets/)` link.

### Counterarguments Considered

1. **Eliminative Materialist**: Why only one question? Shouldn't a framework with five tenets generate more areas of uncertainty? Response: Valid critique—noted as structural gap requiring future expansion.

2. **Many-Worlds Defender**: Where is the question challenging MWI rejection? This is the Map's most controversial commitment. Response: Acknowledged as needed addition in future work.

3. **Empiricist**: Is this a substantive article requiring "Relation to Site Perspective" or just an index? Response: As a section index page, the requirements are less strict. The purpose is navigation, not argument.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Intellectual honesty in acknowledging framework limitations
- "Genuine areas of uncertainty" framing distinguishing real from superficial questions
- "Possible revision" admission that tenets might need changing
- Clean index structure (brief summary + discussion link pattern)
- The three key concerns listed for the mechanism question are well-chosen

### Enhancements Made
- Added description to frontmatter
- Added link to `[tenets](/tenets/)` in opening paragraph
- Clarified wikilink with explicit display text
- Added `ai_modified` and `last_deep_review` timestamps
- Added `ai_system` field

### Cross-links Added
- `[tenets](/tenets/)` in opening paragraph
- `[tenets](/tenets/)` in related_articles

## Remaining Items

1. **Section expansion needed**: Should add questions about other tenets:
   - Why reject Many Worlds? (challenges No Many Worlds tenet)
   - Is Occam's Razor critique too convenient? (challenges Occam's Limits tenet)
   - What positive evidence supports dualism beyond arguments against materialism? (challenges Dualism tenet)

2. **Consider adding meta-question**: "Are the tenets the right starting point?"

## Stability Notes

This is the first review of this document. As a section index page, it serves a navigational rather than argumentative purpose. The main structural issue—having only one question—reflects the project's early state rather than a flaw in the document itself. Future reviews should assess whether the section has been populated with additional questions rather than re-flagging this issue.
