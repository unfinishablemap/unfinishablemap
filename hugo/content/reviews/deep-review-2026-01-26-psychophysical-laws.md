title: Deep Review - Psychophysical Laws
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-01-26
**Article**: [Psychophysical Laws](/concepts/psychophysical-laws/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-20](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-20-psychophysical-laws/)
**Context**: Cross-review considering framework article insights

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Six adversarial personas evaluated the article with particular attention to consistency with the newly reviewed framework article (psychophysical-laws-framework.md).

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article has all required sections, no factual errors detected, no internal contradictions.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Decoherence language inconsistency**: The concept article stated "The categorical objection ('warm systems must be classical') is empirically weakening" which was stronger than the more balanced language in the framework article.
   - **Resolution**: Updated to match framework article's balanced presentation, acknowledging that most physicists still accept Tegmark's calculations while noting the question is whether any quantum effects survive at relevant scales.

2. **Missing phenomenology skepticism acknowledgment**: The contemplative evidence section presented the phenomenology of effort without acknowledging that phenomenology can be systematically misleading.
   - **Resolution**: Added acknowledgment that skeptics object phenomenology might be confabulation, with the Map's response that discounting first-person evidence about consciousness is self-undermining.

3. **Missing cross-reference to framework article**: The two articles (concept vs. topic) should clearly reference each other to help readers navigate.
   - **Resolution**: Added cross-reference to [psychophysical-laws-framework](/topics/psychophysical-laws-bridging-mind-and-matter/) in opening paragraph, related_articles, and Further Reading.

4. **Redundancy with framework article**: Both articles had similar "What Would Challenge This View?" sections after the framework article's deep review added one.
   - **Resolution**: Condensed the concept article's falsifiability section to a brief summary with pointer to the framework article's extended discussion.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Dennett's phenomenology objection**: The feeling of effort might be confabulation. Added acknowledgment with the Map's response.
- **Tegmark's decoherence calculations**: Updated language to more accurately represent mainstream physics consensus while noting ongoing questions.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

Six sympathetic personas evaluated the article's strengths and opportunities.

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear supervenience vs. causal laws distinction (unique to this concept article)
- Chalmers' three principles explained in depth
- Process philosophy section provides distinctive Whiteheadian framework
- Contemplative evidence section with witness consciousness, mental effort, quiet mind
- Illusionist challenge with regress response
- Strong tenet connections covering all five tenets
- Haecceity connection to organizational invariance rejection

### Enhancements Made
1. **Added framework article cross-reference**: Opening now directs readers to [psychophysical-laws-framework](/topics/psychophysical-laws-bridging-mind-and-matter/) for integrated overview
2. **Balanced decoherence presentation**: More accurately represents physics consensus while noting open questions
3. **Strengthened contemplative evidence**: Acknowledged phenomenology skepticism with principled response
4. **Condensed falsifiability section**: Reduced redundancy with framework article by summarizing and linking

### Cross-links Added
- [psychophysical-laws-framework](/topics/psychophysical-laws-bridging-mind-and-matter/) (in opening, related_articles, and Further Reading)

## Remaining Items

None. All medium-priority issues were addressed.

## Stability Notes

The following represent fundamental philosophical disagreements rather than fixable problems:

- **Eliminativist critique**: The article presupposes the hard problem is genuine. This is a Map tenet. The Moorean response is a legitimate philosophical move, not question-begging.
- **MWI proponent critique**: Rejection of many-worlds is a tenet-level commitment.
- **Buddhist/process critique**: The article treats consciousness as having causal powers. Alternative frameworks are valid philosophical options; the Map's framework is internally consistent.
- **Phenomenology skepticism**: The Map holds that systematically discounting first-person evidence about consciousness is self-undermining. Dennett disagrees. This is a bedrock methodological disagreement.

## Word Count

- Before: 3234 words (129% of 2500 threshold)
- After: 3180 words (127% of 2500 threshold)
- Change: -54 words (condensed falsifiability section)

Article remains above soft threshold but within acceptable range. Further condensation would require removing substantive content that distinguishes this concept article from the framework overview.
