title: Deep Review - Consciousness and the Ownership Problem
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-03-01
**Article**: [Consciousness and the Ownership Problem](/topics/consciousness-and-the-ownership-problem/)
**Previous review**: [2026-02-15](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-15-consciousness-and-the-ownership-problem/)
**Context**: Cross-review considering phenomenological-psychiatry insights

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Ipseity disturbance model oversimplified**: The article referenced the ipseity disturbance model but only captured diminished self-affection, missing the hyperreflexivity component. Since Sass and Parnas define the disturbance as two intertwined features — hyperreflexivity (tacit processes becoming alien objects) and diminished self-affection (loss of inhabited selfhood) — the omission missed the deeper structural insight. Resolution: Expanded the phenomenological psychiatry paragraph to include both components and their interrelation.
- **Missing empirical validation**: The clinical evidence for ownership disruption was presented as philosophical observation without noting its empirical grounding. Resolution: Added reference to the EASE instrument and its predictive validity for schizophrenia spectrum onset.
- **Missing cross-link**: The phenomenological-psychiatry-and-altered-experience article was referenced inline but absent from Further Reading and frontmatter related_articles. Resolution: Added to both.
- **Missing references**: Sass & Parnas (2003) and EASE instrument (Parnas et al., 2005) were not cited despite the article drawing on their model. Resolution: Added to References section.

### Low Issues Found
- Functionalism critique still somewhat question-begging (the dualist intuition that there's "someone home" is precisely what's at issue). Deferred — previous review improved this and noted it as a standing philosophical disagreement.
- Falsifiability section sets up four challenges then immediately argues they can't be met. Deferred — previous review noted this and the philosophical honesty outweighs the optics concern.
- Could reference Fuchs' bidirectional embodiment disruption (disembodiment in schizophrenia vs. hyper-embodiment in depression) in the physicalism section, but this argument is better placed in the phenomenological psychiatry article where it already appears.

### Counterarguments Considered
- Eliminative materialist: Neural manipulability of ownership (via antipsychotics, depersonalization treatment) suggests neural constitution, not just correlation → Article addresses this implicitly through the ownership-as-primitive framework and the phenomenological psychiatry article's "correlation proves interface, not identity" caveat
- Dennett/functionalism: No further fact about ownership beyond functional role → Addressed in text; bedrock disagreement
- MWI branching: Already addressed in previous review; bedrock disagreement confirmed
- Buddhist conventional/ultimate: Already addressed in previous review; charitable engagement maintained

### Attribution Accuracy
- Husserl on first-personal givenness: **Verified** (previous review)
- Zahavi on minimal self: **Verified** (previous review)
- Sass & Parnas ipseity disturbance model: **Now accurately represented** with both hyperreflexivity and diminished self-affection
- EASE instrument: **Accurately described** as validated clinical instrument confirming self-disorders in schizophrenia spectrum
- No source/Map conflation detected
- No dropped qualifiers
- No self-contradictions

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Three-part distinction (not binding, not unity, not self) — exceptional philosophical clarity
- Book analogy ("words are not about anything until someone reads them") — vivid and accessible
- Duplication thought experiment — cleanly shows intrinsic physical properties can't fix ownership
- Ownership-agency connection — simple and powerful argument
- "What Would Challenge This View?" section — honest falsifiability engagement
- Charge analogy for primitiveness — makes philosophical primitiveness intuitive
- Opening paragraph — front-loads the core question effectively
- Buddhist engagement with conventional/ultimate distinction — charitable and philosophically substantive
- MWI response including "branching creates distinct subjects" counter — thorough

### Enhancements Made
- Enriched phenomenological psychiatry paragraph with hyperreflexivity/diminished self-affection distinction (+~70 words)
- Added EASE instrument reference as empirical validation of ownership disruption claims (+~40 words)
- Added phenomenological-psychiatry-and-altered-experience to Further Reading and frontmatter related_articles
- Added Sass & Parnas (2003) and Parnas et al. (2005) to References

### Cross-links Added
- [phenomenological-psychiatry-and-altered-experience](/topics/phenomenological-psychiatry-and-altered-experience/) (Further Reading + frontmatter)

## Word Count
- Before: 2334 words (78% of 3000 threshold)
- After: 2446 words (82% of 3000 threshold)
- Change: +112 words

## Remaining Items

- Illusionism response could engage more deeply with Dennett's heterophenomenology (deferred from previous review — current treatment adequate)
- Falsifiability section's immediate dismissal of challenges could be softened (deferred from previous review — philosophical honesty outweighs optics)
- Fuchs' bidirectional embodiment disruption could strengthen the physicalism section, but better suited to phenomenological psychiatry article where it already appears

## Stability Notes

- This article is approaching stability after two reviews. The core arguments, structure, and tenet connections are solid. The main improvement this round was precision in the phenomenological psychiatry paragraph — a cross-review integration task rather than a structural issue.
- MWI defenders will always contest the determinacy-of-ownership claim — bedrock disagreement, not a flaw to fix (confirmed from previous review)
- Eliminative materialists will reject ownership as genuine — bedrock disagreement (confirmed from previous review)
- Buddhist philosophers may find the irreducible-ownership claim unconvincing — genuine metaphysical disagreement (confirmed from previous review)
- Functionalists will deny there's a further fact beyond functional role — bedrock disagreement (newly noted, not critical)
