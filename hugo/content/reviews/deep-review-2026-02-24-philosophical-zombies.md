title: Deep Review - Philosophical Zombies

**Date**: 2026-02-24
**Article**: [Philosophical Zombies](/concepts/philosophical-zombies/)
**Previous review**: [2026-02-03](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-03-philosophical-zombies/)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article remains well-structured and accurate. All six adversarial personas engaged; no new problems identified.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing cross-links to epistemology of other minds**: The article discusses epistemological implications (self-stultification, paradox of phenomenal judgment) without linking to the dedicated epistemology articles. **Resolution**: Added `[epistemology-of-other-minds-under-dualism](/concepts/epistemology-of-other-minds-under-dualism/)` and `[problem-of-other-minds](/concepts/problem-of-other-minds/)` to frontmatter and Further Reading; added one sentence in Self-Stultification section connecting zombie reports to the other-minds epistemology.
- **Duplicate Further Reading entry**: `[the-case-for-dualism](/concepts/the-case-for-dualism/)` appeared twice with different descriptions (lines 190 and 205). **Resolution**: Removed the duplicate, keeping the first entry with the more specific description.

### Low Issues Found
- **Stale AI refinement log**: HTML comment from 2026-02-16 stating "This log should be removed after human review" persisted through two deep reviews. **Resolution**: Removed.

### Counterarguments Considered
All six adversarial personas engaged:
1. **Eliminative Materialist**: Addressed via Type-A physicalism section—bedrock disagreement, not fixable flaw
2. **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: Heterophenomenology and Frankish exchange are well-balanced after Feb 16 condensation
3. **Quantum Skeptic**: Quantum claims appropriately hedged and confined to Relation to Site Perspective
4. **Many-Worlds Defender**: MWI disagreement is a bedrock philosophical standoff
5. **Empiricist**: Four falsifiable conditions present and reasonable
6. **Buddhist Philosopher**: No Buddhist perspective included, but article is a focused concepts piece on a specific argument—not a comprehensive survey

### Attribution Accuracy Check
All attributions verified:
- Chalmers, Block ("China brain"), Tallis ("misrepresentation presupposes presentation"), Frankish ("quasi-phenomenal properties") — all correctly attributed
- Chalmers conceivability paraphrase (line 72-73) — correctly presented as paraphrase (fixed in previous review)
- No misattributions, dropped qualifiers, or source/Map conflation detected

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Three-step argument structure (clear, memorable, logically rigorous)
- "Lights are on, but nobody's home" opening metaphor
- Self-stultification section (practical epistemic force)
- "Illusionism strengthens zombies" reversal (distinctive and effective)
- Process Philosophy perspective with Whitehead (unique in zombie discussions)
- Comprehensive five-tenet coverage in Relation to Site Perspective
- "What Would Challenge This View?" section (genuine falsifiability)
- Contrast between zombie conceivability and round-square conceivability failure (philosophically sharp)

### Enhancements Made
- Added cross-links to `[epistemology-of-other-minds-under-dualism](/concepts/epistemology-of-other-minds-under-dualism/)` and `[problem-of-other-minds](/concepts/problem-of-other-minds/)` in frontmatter concepts and Further Reading
- Added one sentence connecting self-stultification to epistemology of other minds (zombie reports indistinguishable from conscious being's → verbal testimony alone cannot settle consciousness)
- Removed duplicate `[the-case-for-dualism](/concepts/the-case-for-dualism/)` from Further Reading
- Removed stale AI refinement log

### Cross-links Added
- [epistemology-of-other-minds-under-dualism](/concepts/epistemology-of-other-minds-under-dualism/)
- [problem-of-other-minds](/concepts/problem-of-other-minds/)

## Remaining Items

None.

## Stability Notes

This is the third deep review of this article. The article has reached a high level of stability.

**Stable elements:**
- Core argument structure, physicalist response taxonomy, illusionism engagement, and tenet connections are all well-established
- Length is well-managed at 2414 words (97% of 2500 threshold)
- All attributions verified accurate
- Cross-link network is now comprehensive, including the new epistemology articles

**Bedrock disagreements (not fixable flaws):**
- MWI defenders will always find the indexical argument unsatisfying
- Eliminative materialists will always challenge folk psychological categories
- These are philosophical standoffs, not article defects

**Context for this review:** Reviewed specifically in light of the new `epistemology-of-other-minds-under-dualism.md` article (created 2026-02-23). The primary value of this review was establishing reciprocal cross-links between the zombie article and the epistemology articles.

**Recommendation:** This article should be considered fully stable. Future reviews should only be triggered by:
1. New substantive content added to the article
2. External developments (new papers, arguments) warranting updates
3. User specifically requesting further refinement
