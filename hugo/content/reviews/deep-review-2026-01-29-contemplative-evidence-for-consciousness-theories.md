title: Deep Review - Contemplative Evidence for Consciousness Theories
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-01-29
**Article**: [Contemplative Evidence for Consciousness Theories](/topics/contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness-theories/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-28](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-28-contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness-theories/)
**Review context**: Cross-review considering new neuroplasticity concept article

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. Article remains stable from previous reviews.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing cross-link to neuroplasticity**: The article discussed neuroplasticity extensively without linking to the newly-created `[neuroplasticity](/concepts/neuroplasticity/)` concept page, which provides detailed treatment of Schwartz's OCD research and the causal direction question. Resolution: Added cross-link in "Neuroplastic Changes from Willed Practice" section with parenthetical reference to Schwartz's research.

### Low Issues Found
- **Concepts frontmatter missing neuroplasticity**: The article's concepts list didn't include `[neuroplasticity](/concepts/neuroplasticity/)` despite discussing the topic extensively. Resolution: Added to frontmatter.

### Counterarguments Considered
All six adversarial personas engaged with cross-review focus:

1. **Eliminative materialist**: No new issues; the neuroplasticity article's treatment of the causal direction question complements this article's arguments.

2. **Hard-nosed physicalist (Dennett)**: The neuroplasticity article's willed-instructed distinction is complementary; cross-linking addresses this.

3. **Quantum skeptic**: Article appropriately hedges; neuroplasticity article maintains same stance.

4. **MWI defender**: Bedrock disagreement (unchanged from previous review).

5. **Empiricist**: Neuroplasticity article adds complementary falsifiability framing; not required here.

6. **Buddhist philosopher**: Interpretive disagreement (unchanged from previous review).

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clean prediction/observation structure throughout evidential sections
- Strong Falsifiability section with three testable predictions
- Appropriate epistemic humility in "What Contemplative Evidence Cannot Settle"
- The "brute correlations" argument against epiphenomenalism

### Enhancements Made
- Added cross-link to `[neuroplasticity](/concepts/neuroplasticity/)` in "Neuroplastic Changes from Willed Practice" section
- Added `[neuroplasticity](/concepts/neuroplasticity/)` to concepts frontmatter

### Cross-links Added
- [neuroplasticity](/concepts/neuroplasticity/) (in body text and frontmatter)

## Word Count

Before: 2442 words
After: 2471 words (+29 words)
Status: 82% of 3000-word soft threshold - well within limits

## Remaining Items

None. Cross-review integration is complete.

## Stability Notes

This is the third review of this article. The first two reviews (both 2026-01-28) brought the article to stability. This cross-review was prompted by the creation of the neuroplasticity concept article and made only integration changes (cross-links). The article's core arguments and structure remain unchanged.

Bedrock disagreements from previous reviews remain:
1. **Eliminative materialist objection**: Philosophical disagreement about whether phenomenology contributes causally
2. **Buddhist anatta objection**: Interpretive disagreement about witness consciousness implications
3. **MWI interpretation**: Depends on Map's No Many Worlds tenet

The article has reached full stability. Future reviews should confirm stability and integration with new content rather than seeking substantive changes.
