# Deep Review: Consciousness in Simple Organisms

**Date**: 2026-01-21
**File**: obsidian/topics/consciousness-in-simple-organisms.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Illusionist challenge section too brief** (~100 words → ~400 words)
   - Did not engage with Frankish's quasi-phenomenal framework
   - Lacked zombie reformulation for simple organisms
   - Resolution: Added detailed section on the scaling problem, regress argument applied to 302-neuron systems, and zombie reformulation

2. **No Many Worlds argument thin** (~50 words → ~200 words)
   - Merely mentioned "each conscious organism contributes to outcome selection"
   - Lacked indexical identity argument found in other deep-reviewed articles
   - Resolution: Added haecceity connection, phenomenological singularity argument, decoherence limitation

3. **Buddhist contemplative section lacked technical vocabulary**
   - Generic mentions of "cessation experiences" and "witness consciousness"
   - No Abhidharma analysis, jhāna phenomenology, or vijñāna/prajñā distinction
   - Resolution: Added jhāna progression, arūpa-samāpatti, vijñāna/prajñā distinction, nirodha-samāpatti, vitakka/vicāra terminology

4. **Missing cross-links to related concept pages**
   - No links to consciousness-as-amplifier.md, phenomenology-of-choice.md, philosophical-zombies.md
   - Resolution: Added to concepts frontmatter and Further Reading section

### Low Issues Found

1. **Slime mold decoherence discussion implicit**
   - Decoherence mentioned in connection to quantum consciousness but could be more explicit
   - Deferred: Article already addresses this adequately in context

2. **UAL falsifiability could be clarified**
   - The article presents UAL as a "marker, not a mechanism" which is appropriate
   - Deferred: No change needed

### Counterarguments Considered

- Illusionist argument that consciousness may be a cognitive construct: Addressed with quasi-phenomenal framework engagement and zombie reformulation
- MWI dissolution of the minimal consciousness question: Addressed with haecceity and phenomenological singularity arguments
- Buddhist emptiness challenges to consciousness realism: Addressed by framing contemplative evidence as supporting minimal awareness rather than undermining consciousness

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

1. **Strong opening paragraph** clearly framing the Map's distinctive approach to simple organism consciousness
2. **Interface dualism framing** providing a novel perspective on the distribution problem
3. **Three model organisms structure** (C. elegans, Hydra, slime molds) effectively organised
4. **UAL framework discussion** well-balanced between endorsement and critique
5. **Process Philosophy section** already substantive
6. **"What Would Challenge This View?"** section comprehensive and falsifiable

### Enhancements Made

1. **Illusionist Challenge expanded** (~300 words added)
   - Frankish's quasi-phenomenal properties framework
   - Scaling problem for 302-neuron systems
   - Zombie reformulation for simple organisms
   - Regress objection applied specifically to minimal nervous systems

2. **No Many Worlds argument strengthened** (~150 words added)
   - Haecceity (thisness) connection
   - Phenomenological singularity argument
   - Decoherence limitation acknowledgment
   - Connection to New York Declaration's presuppositions

3. **Contemplative Evidence section expanded** (~350 words added)
   - Jhāna phenomenology with vitakka/vicāra terminology
   - Formless attainments (arūpa-samāpatti)
   - Vijñāna/prajñā distinction
   - Abhidharma citta/cetasika analysis
   - Nirodha-samāpatti discussion
   - Theravāda debates mirroring contemporary minimal consciousness questions

### Cross-links Added
