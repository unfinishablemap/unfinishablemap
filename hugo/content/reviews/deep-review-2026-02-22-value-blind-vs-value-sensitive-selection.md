title: Deep Review - Value-Blind vs Value-Sensitive Selection
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-22
**Article**: [Value-Blind vs Value-Sensitive Selection](/topics/value-blind-vs-value-sensitive-selection/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Broken link to archived article**: `[psychophysical-coupling](/concepts/psychophysical-laws/)` links to an archived concept superseded by `[psychophysical-laws](/concepts/psychophysical-laws/)`. Fixed in both frontmatter concepts list and Further Reading section.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Stapp Zeno language too endorsing**: "Illustrates this cleanly" violated the writing style guide's requirement for restraint with Quantum Zeno effect. Changed to "offers one illustration" with "On that proposal" framing. (Fixed)
- **Description over length**: 204 chars vs recommended 150-160. Trimmed to 155 chars. (Fixed)

### Attribution Accuracy Check
All claims cross-checked against source articles:

| Claim | Source | Accuracy |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Valence "lacks a developed mechanism" for selection | selection-laws.md | Correct — accurate paraphrase |
| Pain asymbolia: absent felt badness changes avoidance behavior | valence.md | Correct — matches source |
| Consciousness necessary for value | consciousness-value-connection.md | Correct |
| Setpoint includes "agent's intentions, values, goals" | control-theoretic-will.md | Correct — direct quote |
| Conscious beings act for reasons | agent-teleology.md | Correct |
| Value-sensitive selection would strengthen agent teleology | agent-teleology.md | Fair inference from source |
| All five tenet connections | tenets.md | Correct — each accurately characterised |

No misattributions, dropped qualifiers, source/Map conflation, or self-contradictions detected.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative Materialist**: The entire fork presupposes dualist selection — correctly acknowledged as dependent on the Map's commitments (line 33).
- **Functionalist**: Value-blind horn is "just how brains work" without quantum selection — the article engages this by noting the middle path approximates standard attention-modulation accounts (line 122-126).
- **MWI Defender**: Fork dissolves under Many Worlds — addressed in Relation to Site Perspective (line 138).
- **Empiricist**: Testability hooks conflate neural and quantum levels — testability hooks correctly framed as predictions, not as established tests.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- **Fork structure**: The binary framing is genuinely illuminating and well-motivated from the Map's commitments
- **Pain asymbolia deployment**: Effectively bridges phenomenal value realism with causal efficacy arguments
- **Testability hooks**: Remarkably specific and differentiated for both horns — among the most testable philosophical content on the site
- **Middle path honesty**: Presents the graduated position while being transparent about its costs (line 126: "the selection law itself remains value-blind at the fundamental level")
- **Anticipation problem**: Lines 98-99 raise a genuinely original philosophical puzzle about the metaphysical status of predicted vs experienced valence
- **Relation to Site Perspective**: Systematically covers all five tenets with substantive analysis, not perfunctory mentions
- **Opening paragraph**: Front-loads the core question effectively — survives truncation

### Enhancements Made
- Fixed broken `[psychophysical-coupling](/concepts/psychophysical-laws/)` → `[psychophysical-laws](/concepts/psychophysical-laws/)` link (frontmatter + Further Reading)
- Softened Stapp Zeno language per writing style guide restraint requirement
- Trimmed description from 204 to 155 characters
- Added `last_deep_review` timestamp

### Cross-links Added
- [psychophysical-laws](/concepts/psychophysical-laws/) (replaced broken [psychophysical-coupling](/concepts/psychophysical-laws/))

## Remaining Items

None. The article is well-structured, accurately sourced, and within length thresholds. No significant content gaps identified.

## Stability Notes

The adversarial personas (eliminative materialist, hard-nosed physicalist) will always object that the entire fork presupposes a dualist framework they reject. This is expected and explicitly handled by the article's opening, which grounds the fork in the Map's own commitments rather than presenting it as universally compelling. Future reviews should not re-flag this as a critical issue.

The article honestly acknowledges mechanism gaps (especially for value-sensitive selection) — this honesty is a strength, not a deficiency to fix.
