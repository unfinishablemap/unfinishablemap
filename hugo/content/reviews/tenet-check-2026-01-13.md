# Tenet Alignment Check

**Date**: 2026-01-13
**Files checked**: 19 (7 topics, 12 concepts)
**Errors**: 0
**Warnings**: 0
**Notes**: 2

## Summary

All site content aligns well with the five foundational tenets. No direct contradictions or implicit conflicts were found. Two notes identify opportunities for clarification, not problems.

The content effectively:
- Presents the project's dualist, interactionist framework consistently
- Distinguishes the project's view from competing positions (functionalism, epiphenomenalism, panpsychism, idealism)
- Avoids quantum mysticism while taking quantum consciousness seriously
- Handles tensions productively (e.g., Buddhism's no-self vs. site's dualism)

## Errors

None.

## Warnings

None.

## Notes

### eastern-philosophy-consciousness.md
- **Tenet**: Dualism
- **Issue**: The article acknowledges tension between Buddhism's no-self (anattā) and dualism, which might concern readers expecting strict alignment.
- **Quote**: "Buddhism's no-self (anattā) doctrine... denies any permanent, substantial self. But how much does this conflict actually amount to?"
- **Assessment**: The article handles this productively, distinguishing permanent substance from moment-to-moment irreducibility. The tension is acknowledged and explored rather than hidden. No change needed, but future content could further develop how property dualism accommodates impermanence.

### integrated-information-theory.md
- **Tenet**: Bidirectional Interaction
- **Issue**: IIT is presented sympathetically despite conflicting with the bidirectional interaction tenet.
- **Quote**: "IIT has no room for this [bidirectional interaction]. If consciousness *is* integrated information, it doesn't *do* anything to the physical."
- **Assessment**: The article correctly identifies the conflict and explains why the project's framework differs. IIT is presented as a "sophisticated competitor" worth engaging, not as a view the project endorses. This is appropriate intellectual engagement, not a tenet violation.

## Highlights

**Strongest alignment**: The epiphenomenalism.md and functionalism.md articles explicitly engage rival views and explain the project's rejection clearly.

**Best handling of tension**: The eastern-philosophy-consciousness.md article navigates a genuinely difficult philosophical tension with sophistication.

**Most thorough tenet integration**: The free-will.md article connects all four relevant tenets (Dualism, Bidirectional Interaction, Minimal Quantum Interaction, No Many Worlds) into a coherent framework.

## Recommendations

1. Consider adding explicit tenet cross-references to the voids/ section content when it expands.

2. The draft articles (purpose-and-alignment.md, apophatic-approaches.md) should receive tenet alignment review before publication.

3. Future content on Many Worlds interpretations could strengthen the No Many Worlds tenet's articulation.
