title: Deep Review - Consciousness and Causal Powers
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-22
**Article**: [Consciousness and Causal Powers](/topics/consciousness-and-causal-powers/)
**Previous review**: [2026-02-15](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-15-consciousness-and-causal-powers/)

## Review Context

This review was conducted with specific attention to insights from [conservation-laws-and-mind](/topics/conservation-laws-and-mind/), examining whether the causal powers article adequately leverages the sophisticated conservation law arguments available (Cucu/Pitts on conservation being local and conditional, the question-begging nature of the energy objection, selection among energetically equivalent outcomes).

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None

### Medium Issues Found
- Physical Constraint section asserted conservation compatibility without explaining WHY: Strengthened with key arguments from conservation-laws-and-mind — conservation is local and conditional on symmetries, the energy objection begs the question, and selection among energetically equivalent outcomes requires no energy transfer
- Missing cross-link to [causal-closure](/concepts/causal-closure/) in Metaphysics subsection: Added

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist**: Reifies consciousness as a unified agent with specifiable powers — bedrock disagreement, already engaged via Evidential Question section; no change needed
- **Hard-nosed physicalist**: "Selection" vs "force" is a distinction without a difference — response from previous review (identity theories render phenomenal character epiphenomenal) still standing
- **Quantum skeptic**: Physical Constraint section was too hand-wavy — addressed by incorporating conservation-laws-and-mind arguments
- **Empiricist**: Framework lacks direct evidence — article's honest acknowledgment remains a strength
- **Many-worlds defender**: Framework assumes collapse — appropriate since MWI rejection is a tenet
- **Buddhist philosopher**: Who possesses these causal powers? — bedrock disagreement about selfhood, not addressed (article scope is causal powers, not personal identity)

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- The four-constraint framework (interface, physical, probabilistic, temporal) — excellent systematic analysis
- The does/does-not parallel structure — clarity through contrast
- Evidential Question section's intellectual honesty about speculative elements
- Volitional Modulation phenomenological grounding (effortful resistance vs. letting go)
- Key phrases: "a precise interface between phenomenal experience and physical reality"; "Consciousness selects a path through possibility space; it doesn't inject resources from outside that space"

### Enhancements Made
- Strengthened Physical Constraint section with conservation-laws-and-mind arguments: conservation is local and conditional, energy objection begs the question, selection among energetically equivalent outcomes requires no energy transfer
- Added [causal-closure](/concepts/causal-closure/) cross-link in Metaphysics subsection
- Added [causal-closure](/concepts/causal-closure/) to frontmatter concepts

### Cross-links Added
- [causal-closure](/concepts/causal-closure/) — in body text and frontmatter

## Remaining Items

- The phenomenal biasing section (lines 101-105) remains somewhat thin — could be expanded with more on how qualia map to action tendencies. Modest scope for a future review if the article evolves further.
- A dedicated falsifiability discussion remains deferred — better addressed in epistemology-of-dualism content.

## Stability Notes

- This article is approaching stability. The previous review (2026-02-15) found no critical issues and made substantial structural improvements. This review made only two targeted changes, both informed by the specific review context (conservation-laws-and-mind integration).
- Adversarial personas will always find this framework unsatisfying — these remain bedrock philosophical disagreements, not fixable flaws.
- The article's honest acknowledgment that the quantum mechanism is speculative and that additional arguments for dualism are needed remains a deliberate strength.
- Future reviews should focus on whether the article's claims remain consistent with evolving site content, not on re-engaging the same philosophical objections.
