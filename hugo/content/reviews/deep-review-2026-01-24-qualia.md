title: Deep Review - Qualia
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-01-24
**Article**: [Qualia](/concepts/qualia/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-20T09:35:00+00:00](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-20-qualia/)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Missing cross-links to recent articles**: Added [phenomenal-consciousness](/concepts/phenomenal-consciousness/), [access-consciousness](/concepts/access-consciousness/), [conscious-vs-unconscious-processing](/archive/topics/conscious-vs-unconscious-processing/), [baseline-cognition](/archive/topics/baseline-cognition/) to frontmatter and Further Reading

### Medium Issues Found
- **Access/phenomenal distinction underdeveloped**: Added paragraph after opening explaining qualia's relationship to phenomenal consciousness vs access consciousness
- **Jackson's later retraction unmentioned**: Added note that Jackson recanted though the Map maintains the argument succeeds
- **Unsourced claim (82% statistic)**: Softened to "surveys suggest most non-philosophers agree"
- **Missing cross-link to [buddhism-and-dualism](/concepts/buddhism-and-dualism/)**: Added as new challenge condition and in Further Reading
- **Missing cross-link to [mysterianism-cognitive-closure](/archive/topics/mysterianism-cognitive-closure/)**: Added in Further Reading

### Counterarguments Considered
- Eliminative materialist challenge to qualia's existence: Already addressed in illusionism section
- Buddhist no-self challenge to qualia ownership: Added as new challenge condition #6

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Four properties of qualia clearly explained (intrinsic, private, ineffable, directly apprehensible)
- Thorough treatment of illusionism challenge and regress objection
- Process philosophy section offers valuable alternative framing
- Thought experiments well-explained with appropriate depth
- Connection to all five tenets is substantive

### Enhancements Made
- Clarified relationship between qualia and phenomenal/access consciousness distinction
- Added sixth challenge condition (Buddhist no-self)
- Updated section header to "Relation to Site Perspective" for consistency
- Enhanced Further Reading with six new cross-links

### Cross-links Added
- [phenomenal-consciousness](/concepts/phenomenal-consciousness/)
- [access-consciousness](/concepts/access-consciousness/)
- [conscious-vs-unconscious-processing](/archive/topics/conscious-vs-unconscious-processing/)
- [baseline-cognition](/archive/topics/baseline-cognition/)
- [mysterianism-cognitive-closure](/archive/topics/mysterianism-cognitive-closure/)
- [buddhism-and-dualism](/concepts/buddhism-and-dualism/)
