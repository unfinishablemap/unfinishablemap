**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None.

### Medium Issues Found
- Missing wikilinks: `[inverted-qualia](/concepts/inverted-qualia/)` discussed but linked to wrong target (`[inverted qualia](/concepts/qualia/)`); `[neural-correlates-of-consciousness](/concepts/neural-correlates-of-consciousness/)` discussed but not linked. **Resolved**: Fixed both links.
- No engagement with the operationalist/functionalist response — the strongest counterargument to the article's thesis. **Resolved**: Added "The Operationalist Response" section engaging with operationalism and heterophenomenology.
- Missing cross-links to closely related articles: `[knowledge-argument](/concepts/knowledge-argument/)`, `[measurement-problem-as-hard-problem](/topics/the-measurement-problem-as-philosophical-problem/)`, `[consciousness-and-the-meta-problem-of-scientific-explanation](/topics/consciousness-and-the-limits-of-explanation/)`. **Resolved**: Added to frontmatter, body text, and Further Reading.
- Thompson (2007) listed in References but never cited in text. **Resolved**: Added inline citation in neurophenomenology paragraph.
- "Relation to Site Perspective" engaged only 2 of 5 tenets; Bidirectional Interaction is directly relevant. **Resolved**: Added paragraph on Bidirectional Interaction tenet and its connection to the measurement asymmetry.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative Materialist**: Phenomenal categories may be folk-psychological and eliminable — the measurement gap dissolves if the category is confused. Acknowledged implicitly through the operationalist section.
- **Operationalist/Functionalist**: Operational definitions can create measurement standards by convention. Addressed in new section — the response is that this changes the subject from phenomenal to neural quantities.
- **Heterophenomenological**: Reports may exhaust what there is to study (Dennett). Addressed in new section — the Map maintains this dissolution is premature.
- **Buddhist/Non-dualist**: The measurement gap could indicate emptiness rather than irreducible subjectivity. Not addressed — low priority, would require extensive engagement with non-Western frameworks.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- The measurement triad framework (units, instruments, calibration) — original, clear, pedagogically effective
- Pain non-additivity argument — concrete and compelling
- Thermoscope historical analogy with Chang reference
- Proxy vs. measurement distinction — "The language of measurement is borrowed; the reality of measurement is absent"
- Clear progressive argument structure
- Opening summary front-loads the core claim effectively

### Enhancements Made
- Added "The Operationalist Response" section (engaging strongest counterargument strengthens the article)
- Added Bidirectional Interaction tenet connection (causal asymmetry illuminates measurement asymmetry)
- Added knowledge argument parallel (generalises Mary's Room from single case to structural impossibility)
- Added quantum measurement problem cross-reference
- Fixed wikilinks for inverted-qualia and neural-correlates-of-consciousness
- Added Thompson (2007) inline citation
- Expanded Further Reading with 3 additional articles
- Added 3 related_articles to frontmatter

### Cross-links Added
- [neural-correlates-of-consciousness](/concepts/neural-correlates-of-consciousness/)
- [inverted-qualia](/concepts/inverted-qualia/)
- [heterophenomenology](/concepts/heterophenomenology/)
- [knowledge-argument](/concepts/knowledge-argument/)
- [measurement-problem-as-hard-problem](/topics/the-measurement-problem-as-philosophical-problem/)
- [consciousness-and-the-meta-problem-of-scientific-explanation](/topics/consciousness-and-the-limits-of-explanation/)

## Remaining Items
None. All identified medium issues were addressed.

## Stability Notes
- The six adversarial personas (especially Eliminative Materialist and Empiricist) disagree with the article's premise that phenomenal consciousness is a genuine category requiring measurement. This is a bedrock disagreement reflecting the Map's dualist commitments, not a flaw to fix.
- The operationalist response is the strongest counterargument. The new section engages it substantively but maintains the Map's position. Future reviews should not re-flag this as unaddressed.
