title: Deep Review - Phenomenal Value Realism
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Article**: [Phenomenal Value Realism](/concepts/phenomenal-value-realism/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Korsgaard misattribution**: Article described Korsgaard as a "social practices" constructivist contrasted with Rawls's "rational procedures" approach. Korsgaard is actually a Kantian constructivist grounding normativity in practical identity and rational agency—closer to Rawls than the article implied. **Resolution**: Rewritten to accurately characterise both as variants of rational procedure (Rawls's contractualism, Korsgaard's Kantian appeal to practical identity and rational agency).

2. **Moore (1903) phantom reference**: Listed in References but never cited or discussed in the article body. **Resolution**: Engaged with Moore's open question argument in the "Why Dualism Matters Here" section, showing how phenomenal value realism responds to it.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Mackie not cited in body**: Error theory section drew on Mackie's position without naming him. **Resolution**: Added explicit attribution ("most influentially J. L. Mackie in *Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong* (1977)").

2. **Chalmers phantom reference**: Listed but never cited. **Resolution**: Removed from References section.

3. **Pain dissociation unaddressed**: Pain asymbolia challenges the naive pain-badness identity. **Resolution**: Added new subsection "Pain Dissociation: A Challenge" distinguishing sensory from affective components of pain and showing the identity thesis applies to the affective component.

4. **Introspective reliability assumed**: The transparency test depends on introspection without defending its reliability. **Resolution**: Added parenthetical defence distinguishing introspection about causes (unreliable) from introspection about qualitative character (the relevant claim).

5. **Parsimony tension**: The explanatory economy test invokes parsimony while Tenet 5 undermines it. **Resolution**: Added parenthetical note distinguishing a narrow explanatory debt argument from a general appeal to Occam's Razor.

6. **Contemplative response selective and unsupported**: Claimed meditators find valence intrinsic without citation, ignoring Buddhist counter-evidence. **Resolution**: Rewrote to acknowledge mixed evidence across traditions, explicitly noting Buddhist vipassana counterpoint and offering a phenomenal value realist response (equanimity transforms reactive relationship, not felt valence itself).

7. **"Most defenders work within physicalist frameworks" unsupported**: No citation or examples. **Resolution**: Replaced with more accurate framing ("Phenomenal value realism can be held within physicalist frameworks—Rawlette herself does not commit to dualism").

8. **Broken frontmatter link**: `emotional-consciousness` concept referenced in frontmatter but file does not exist. **Resolution**: Removed from frontmatter concepts.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Pain asymbolia**: Addressed with sensory/affective distinction
- **Introspective unreliability**: Addressed with cause vs. character distinction
- **Buddhist contemplative counter-evidence**: Acknowledged and responded to
- **Open question argument (Moore)**: Engaged with directly
- **Parsimony tension with Tenet 5**: Acknowledged and clarified
- **Many-worlds decision-theoretic responses**: Not addressed in this review (existing treatment adequate for article scope; bedrock disagreement)
- **Illusionism regress argument begging the question**: Not modified (the regress argument is structurally sound; the illusionist's response that functional dispositions suffice is itself the position being challenged)

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- **Three tests structure** (coherence, transparency, explanatory economy): Concise, memorable, philosophically sound
- **Opening paragraph**: Front-loaded, survives truncation, sets stakes effectively
- **Preference satisfaction critique**: The "proxy for what matters" argument is exceptionally sharp
- **Relation to Site Perspective**: All five tenets connected with specificity
- **Rawlette citation and engagement**: Well-anchored in specific scholarly work

### Enhancements Made

- **Beyond Hedonism expanded**: Each value dimension (meaning, agency, understanding) now has richer phenomenological description and cross-links
- **Pain dissociation section added**: Engages with empirical challenge to the identity thesis
- **Moore engagement added**: The open question argument is now addressed rather than left as a phantom reference
- **Zombie thought experiment added**: Illustrates the dualism-value connection concretely
- **Contemplative response nuanced**: Now acknowledges cross-traditional evidence rather than making a one-sided claim

## Remaining Items

None. All critical and medium issues addressed. Low-priority items (named-anchor pattern for forward references) deferred as the article's linear structure makes them non-essential.

## Stability Notes

- **Illusionism responses**: The regress argument was flagged as "begging the question" by the Dennett persona. This is a bedrock philosophical disagreement: the phenomenal realist holds that eliminating the subject eliminates the illusion, while the illusionist holds that functional dispositions suffice. Future reviews should not re-flag this as critical.
- **Many-worlds moral urgency**: The Deutsch persona objects that decision-theoretic frameworks preserve moral urgency under many-worlds. The Map's position is that these frameworks are insufficient because they cannot ground *indexical* moral significance. This is a bedrock disagreement tied to Tenet 4.
- **Buddhist emptiness critique**: The Nagarjuna persona challenges the reification of pleasure/pain as having intrinsic natures. The article now acknowledges Buddhist counter-evidence in the contemplative response. Future reviews should not re-flag this as the article has engaged with it directly.
