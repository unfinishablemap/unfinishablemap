# Deep Review: The Binding Problem

**Date**: 2026-01-19
**File**: obsidian/concepts/binding-problem.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- Missing falsifiability section: Resolved by adding "What Would Challenge This View?" subsection specifying four testable commitments
- Tegmark decoherence debate presented as settled: Resolved by reframing to note the debate remains active

### Medium Issues Found
- Missing citations for Goldfarb & Treisman synchrony problems: Resolved with proper citation (Goldfarb & Treisman, 2010; Treisman & Schmidt, 1982)
- Missing citation for 2025 PNAS split-brain study: Resolved by adding "Pinto et al., 2025"
- Eliminativist challenge not acknowledged: Resolved by adding paragraph after BP1/BP2 distinction noting Dennett's position and site's response
- Missing cross-links to minimal-consciousness, global-workspace-theory, emergence: Resolved in frontmatter and Further Reading

### Counterarguments Considered
- Eliminativist position (phenomenal unity as cognitive construction): Acknowledged and responded to
- MWI defense of binding from first-person perspective: Noted briefly; existing coverage in No Many Worlds section deemed adequate
- Methodological concerns about Kerskens-Pérez study: Already acknowledged (Warren 2023) but strengthened in falsifiability section

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent BP1/BP2 distinction with clear explanatory power
- Strong episodic memory binding section integrating autonoetic consciousness
- Compelling sleep dissociation argument (BP1 without BP2)
- Well-integrated experimental evidence from 2024-2025 studies
- Effective use of Nagel's indeterminacy insight on split-brain cases

### Enhancements Made
- Added "Simple Organisms and Binding Limits" section connecting to minimal-consciousness.md
- Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section specifying falsifiable predictions
- Strengthened acknowledgment of ongoing decoherence debate
- Added eliminativist challenge and response for philosophical completeness
- Expanded references with proper citations

### Cross-links Added
- [minimal-consciousness](/concepts/minimal-consciousness/) (frontmatter and Further Reading)
- [global-workspace-theory](/concepts/global-workspace-theory/) (frontmatter and Further Reading)
- [emergence](/concepts/emergence/) (frontmatter and Further Reading)
- [neural-binding-quantum-entanglement-2026-01-19](/research/neural-binding-quantum-entanglement-2026-01-19/) (Further Reading)

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues addressed in this session.

## Word Count Change

Approximately 3,600 → 4,200 words (added ~600 words for simple organisms section, falsifiability section, and eliminativist acknowledgment)
