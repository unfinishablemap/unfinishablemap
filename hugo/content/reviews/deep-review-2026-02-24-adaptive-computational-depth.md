title: Deep Review - Adaptive Computational Depth
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-24
**Article**: [Adaptive Computational Depth](/concepts/adaptive-computational-depth/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Regress argument logical gap**: The claim that "a subroutine within a simulation cannot decide which parts to render" was factually wrong about computing—systems routinely allocate their own resources. **Resolution**: Rewrote the Non-Computability Turn to address the self-allocation objection directly, distinguishing "what to compute" from "what matters" and acknowledging the computationalist counterargument.
- **Missing "What Would Challenge This View?" section**: Standard for Map articles. **Resolution**: Added five-point challenge section.
- **Wolfram → "contextual judgment" source/Map conflation**: The inference from computational irreducibility to "requires contextual judgment" was presented as flowing naturally from Wolfram's work rather than as the Map's interpretation. **Resolution**: Explicitly marked as "The Map draws an inference" and acknowledged computationalist resistance.
- **Interpretation-dependent claims stated as fact**: "Particles lack definite properties until measured" is interpretation-dependent. **Resolution**: Qualified with "On interpretations where measurement produces definite outcomes from indeterminate superpositions—Copenhagen, objective collapse, consciousness-based."

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Self-allocation objection**: Computational systems allocate their own resources without external allocators. Addressed by distinguishing resource allocation (algorithmic) from determining what matters (potentially non-computable).
- **Interpretation dependence**: Quantum indeterminacy is not universally accepted as fundamental. Qualified claims accordingly.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening summary effectively front-loads the key insight (non-computability turn)
- Sources section progression (Wheeler → Bostrom → Wolfram → Irwin → Penrose → Faizal)
- Prebiotic question section's appropriate brevity (references full treatment elsewhere)
- Five-tenet coverage in Relation to Site Perspective
- Effective computational analogies (adaptive mesh refinement, LOD rendering)

### Enhancements Made
- Added Epistemological Status section acknowledging unfalsifiability and bandwidth constraint
- Added What Would Challenge This View? section with five concrete challenges
- Strengthened regress argument with explicit engagement with self-allocation counterargument
- Qualified interpretation-dependent claims
- Marked Wolfram inference as Map's interpretation

### Cross-links Added
- [stapp-quantum-mind](/concepts/stapp-quantum-mind/)
- [attention-as-interface](/concepts/attention-as-interface/)
- [consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns](/concepts/consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns/) (bandwidth constraint reference)

## Remaining Items

None. The article is at a good state for a first review. Future reviews may want to:
- Explore Whitehead's process philosophy connection (actual occasions achieving determinate character through concrescence)
- Consider whether the Chalmers structural coherence thesis deserves mention

## Stability Notes

- The non-computability turn argument will always be contested by computationalists. The self-allocation objection is a bedrock disagreement, not a fixable flaw—the article now engages with it rather than ignoring it.
- MWI proponents will find the incompatibility assertion unsatisfying. This is correctly noted as a fundamental incompatibility, not something that can be argued away.
- The unfalsifiability of consciousness-based quantum interpretations is a feature of the entire Map framework, not specific to this article. The Epistemological Status section now acknowledges this honestly.
