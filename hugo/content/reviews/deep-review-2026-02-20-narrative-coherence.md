title: Deep Review - Narrative Coherence
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-20
**Article**: [Narrative Coherence](/concepts/narrative-coherence/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Broken wikilink**: `[autonoetic-consciousness](/autonoetic-consciousness/)` pointed to a non-existent file. The actual file is `anoetic-noetic-autonoetic-consciousness.md`. Fixed in frontmatter concepts, body text link, and Further Reading section.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Logically suspect thought experiment** (identical psychological profiles): The claim that two agents with "identical psychological profiles" could differ in narrative coherence is self-defeating if the profiles truly include all relational properties. Resolution: Clarified the comparison uses "identical psychological *elements*" in the narrow Parfitian sense (memories, intentions, traits) while noting that Parfit's framework catalogues elements rather than their integration.
- **Overreaching inference from conjunction fallacy**: The leap from "people commit the conjunction fallacy" to "consciousness seeks stories, not statistics" was presented without qualification. Resolution: Added hedging ("this may be more than..."), noted that the bias persists in statistically literate subjects, acknowledged the heuristic alternative interpretation, and added citations for base rate neglect and law of small numbers.
- **No engagement with no-self/Buddhist challenge**: The article claimed narrative coherence requires a substantial self without addressing the major counterposition that narrative is itself a construction. Resolution: Added a paragraph acknowledging the Buddhist objection and articulating the Map's response—that constructionist accounts face the same narrator problem as Parfit's reductionism.
- **Missing cross-link to phenomenology-of-choice**: The article discusses choosing for narrative reasons without linking to the directly relevant concept page. Resolution: Added inline wikilink and Further Reading entry.

### Low Issues Found
- **Missing citations**: Base rate neglect, law of small numbers referenced without citations. Resolution: Added Kahneman & Tversky (1973) and Tversky & Kahneman (1971) to References.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative Materialist**: Neural circuit failure account of breakdowns. Not addressed directly—the existing argument (coherence requires a subject, not just circuits) is adequate.
- **Dennett-style functionalist**: Identical functional organisation entails identical coherence. Addressed by clarifying the Parfitian sense of "psychological profile."
- **Buddhist no-self**: Narrative is construction, not evidence for substantial self. Addressed with new paragraph.
- **Empiricist**: Conjunction fallacy is heuristic, not architectural. Addressed by adding qualification and acknowledging the alternative interpretation.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- The three-feature analysis of narrative coherence (temporal binding, intelligibility, revisability)—philosophically precise and well-structured
- Distinction between temporal unity and narrative coherence (the amnesia example is particularly effective)
- Breakdowns section—phenomenologically precise, clinically informed, philosophically productive
- "Consciousness that flows but does not accumulate direction"—striking formulation
- "Connection without organisation" as critique of Parfit—powerful and concise
- Bidirectional interaction argument through narrative revision

### Enhancements Made
- Fixed broken `[autonoetic-consciousness](/autonoetic-consciousness/)` link → `[autonoetic consciousness](/concepts/anoetic-noetic-autonoetic-consciousness/)`
- Clarified Parfit thought experiment to avoid logical self-defeat
- Added qualification to conjunction fallacy inference
- Added no-self/Buddhist engagement paragraph with Map's response
- Added cross-link to [phenomenology-of-choice](/concepts/phenomenology-of-choice/)
- Added 2 new citations (Kahneman & Tversky 1973, Tversky & Kahneman 1971)

### Cross-links Added
- [phenomenology-of-choice](/concepts/phenomenology-of-choice/) (body text and Further Reading)
- [self-and-consciousness](/concepts/self-and-consciousness/) (body text, in new Buddhist response paragraph)

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues were addressed in this review.

## Stability Notes

- The eliminative materialist objection (neural patterns are not "mere" circuits) is a bedrock philosophical disagreement. The article's existing dualist framing is the Map's committed position—future reviews should not re-flag this.
- The Buddhist no-self challenge is now acknowledged. Future reviews should not re-flag "missing engagement with no-self" but may refine the response if the self-and-consciousness article develops further.
- The qualification on the conjunction fallacy inference ("may be more than a cognitive bias") is intentionally hedged. Future reviews should not strengthen or weaken this calibration unless new empirical evidence changes the picture.
