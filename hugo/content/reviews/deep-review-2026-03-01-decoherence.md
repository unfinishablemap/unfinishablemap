title: Deep Review - Decoherence and the Quantum Consciousness Objection
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-03-01
**Article**: [Decoherence and the Quantum Consciousness Objection](/concepts/decoherence/)
**Previous review**: [2026-02-22](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-22-decoherence/)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
1. **4 broken wikilinks to archived articles**: Links to `quantum-decoherence-objection-responses`, `consciousness-and-quantum-measurement`, `quantum-measurement-and-definite-outcomes`, and `attention-interface-mechanisms` all pointed to articles that have been archived. These were coalesced into other articles.
   - **Resolution**: Replaced with links to live replacement articles (`quantum-measurement-consciousness-interface`). Removed self-referencing link to `quantum-decoherence-objection-responses` (which was coalesced INTO this article). Removed `attention-interface-mechanisms` from Further Reading (content covered by `attention-as-interface`, already linked).

2. **Article exceeded hard word count threshold**: 4030 words vs 3500 hard limit for concepts/. The previous review (2026-02-22) had reduced it to 3344, but it grew back — likely due to content additions between reviews.
   - **Resolution**: Condensed experimental developments section, illusionist challenge, "Relation to the Map's Perspective", and "How the Responses Combine" sections. Trimmed Further Reading from 21 to 12 entries. Reduced from 4030 to 3471 words (-559).

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Self-referencing wikilink**: Line 76 had `[decoherence](/concepts/decoherence/)` linking to itself.
   - **Resolution**: Replaced with plain text "Decoherence".

### Counterarguments Considered
- No new counterarguments needed addressing. Previous reviews thoroughly covered the adversarial angles.

## Attribution Accuracy Check

All attributions verified:
- Tegmark (2000) 10⁻¹³s calculation: correct
- Hagan et al. (2002) correction to 10⁻⁵–10⁻⁴s: correct
- SEP quote on decoherence and measurement problem: correct
- Tallis "Misrepresentation presupposes presentation": correctly attributed
- Fisher (2015) Posner molecules: correct
- Bandyopadhyay (2014) microtubule oscillations: correct

No misattributions, dropped qualifiers, or source/Map conflation found.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening paragraph: excellent front-loading of core argument
- Three-claim disaggregation of the decoherence objection
- "Two Kinds of Timing Requirement": crucial sustained vs. discrete distinction
- "How the Responses Combine" summary table
- Falsifiability section with five concrete conditions
- Mysterian caveat and process philosophy perspectives
- Fair treatment of Tegmark-Hameroff debate

### Enhancements Made
1. Fixed 4 broken wikilinks to archived articles
2. Removed self-referencing wikilink
3. Added `quantum-measurement-consciousness-interface` to frontmatter related_articles
4. Condensed article from 4030 to 3471 words (-559 words, from hard_warning to soft_warning)
5. Tightened experimental developments, illusionism, and tenet relation sections
6. Trimmed Further Reading from 21 to 12 focused entries

### Cross-links Added
- [quantum-measurement-consciousness-interface](/topics/quantum-measurement-consciousness-interface/) (replacing two broken archived links)

## Remaining Items

None — all identified issues addressed.

## Stability Notes

This is the fourth review of this article. The core argument structure, pedagogical approach, and philosophical depth are well-established and stable. This review focused on maintenance issues (broken links from article archiving/coalescing, word count creep) rather than argument restructuring. The article continues to grow slightly between reviews as cross-references are added; future reviews should monitor word count.

Philosophical disagreements (eliminative materialists rejecting the framework, MWI defenders finding the anti-MWI position unsatisfying) remain bedrock disagreements, not flaws to fix. The article's stability is confirmed — no oscillation between reviews.
