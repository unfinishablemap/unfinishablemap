# System Tuning Report

**Date**: 2026-01-08
**Sessions analyzed**: 10 (sessions 1 to 10)
**Period covered**: 2026-01-05 to 2026-01-08

## Executive Summary

The automation system is performing well in its early operation. Zero task failures across 10 sessions indicate robust execution. Content production is healthy with strong convergence progress. This is the first tune-system run, so insufficient data exists for automatic adjustments—all findings are recommendations or observations for human review.

## Metrics Overview

| Metric | Current | Previous | Trend |
|--------|---------|----------|-------|
| Session count | 10 | N/A (first tune) | — |
| Avg tasks/session | 3.4 | N/A | — |
| Failure rate | 0% | N/A | — |
| Convergence | ~50% | ~28% (session 3) | +22% |
| Queue depth (P0-P2) | 3 | 0 (end session 9) | ↑ |

## Findings

### Cadence Analysis

**Data points**: 10 sessions over 4 days (insufficient for pattern detection)

Current maintenance task status:

| Task | Cadence | Last Run | Days Ago | Status |
|------|---------|----------|----------|--------|
| validate-all | 1 day | 2026-01-06 | 2 | Overdue |
| pessimistic-review | 1 day | 2026-01-08 | 0 | Current |
| optimistic-review | 1 day | 2026-01-05 | 3 | **Overdue** |
| check-tenets | 7 days | 2026-01-06 | 2 | On track |
| check-links | 1 day | 2026-01-06 | 2 | Overdue |
| deep-review | 1 day | 2026-01-08 | 0 | Current |

**Observation**: The 1-day cadence for several tasks is aggressive for a project in active development. With /evolve running 2-3 times per week, daily cadences will frequently trigger overdue injections.

**No automatic changes**: Insufficient data (need 5+ sessions showing consistent overdue pattern to adjust).

### Failure Pattern Analysis

**Data points**: 16 tasks in recent_tasks, 0 failures

| Task Type | Executed | Failed | Rate |
|-----------|----------|--------|------|
| research-topic | 7 | 0 | 0% |
| expand-topic | 7 | 0 | 0% |
| refine-draft | 1 | 0 | 0% |
| deep-review | 1 | 0 | 0% |
| pessimistic-review | 1 | 0 | 0% |
| other (coverage) | 1 | 0 | 0% |

**Assessment**: Excellent reliability. No environmental issues detected (API errors, missing files, etc.).

**No automatic changes**: No failures to address.

### Queue Health Analysis

**Data points**: Limited (queue replenished once in session 10)

Last replenishment source breakdown:
- Chain tasks: 0 (0%)
- Unconsumed research: 2 (33%)
- Gap analysis: 4 (67%)
- Staleness: 0 (0%)

**Observations**:
1. Gap analysis is the primary task source. This makes sense for a young project building out coverage.
2. Chain tasks at zero is notable—research-topic completions should generate expand-topic follow-ups. Two pending articles exist (`pending_articles` in state) that weren't yet converted to tasks.
3. Staleness never triggered—appropriate since content is all new (<30 days old).

**No automatic changes**: System working as designed for early-stage project.

### Review Finding Patterns

**Data points**: 3 pessimistic reviews (2026-01-05, 2026-01-08) + 1 optimistic review

**Recurring issues across reviews**:

| Issue | First Raised | Raised Again | Status |
|-------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| Decoherence objection not addressed | 2026-01-05 | 2026-01-08 | **Unresolved** |
| MWI rejection under-argued | 2026-01-05 | 2026-01-08 | Unresolved |
| Placeholder pages as non-draft | 2026-01-05 | — | **Resolved** |
| Bidirectional circularity | 2026-01-05 | — | **Resolved** |

**Assessment**: The system is identifying issues but some recur without resolution. The decoherence objection appears in research notes but hasn't been synthesized into published content.

**Suggested action**: Create task to address decoherence in published quantum/tenets content.

### Convergence Progress

**Data points**: 10 sessions

Progress trajectory:
- Session 1-2: Infrastructure setup
- Session 3: topics=1, concepts=2, research=2
- Session 7: concepts=5, research=5
- Session 9: topics=4, concepts=8, research=9 (major expansion)
- Session 10: topics=5, concepts=8, research=11

**Convergence rate**: ~22% gain from session 3 to 9 (6 sessions)

| Target | Current | Goal | % Complete |
|--------|---------|------|------------|
| Topics | 5 | 10 | 50% |
| Concepts | 8 | 15 | 53% |
| Arguments | 1 | 5 | 20% |
| Critical issues | 0 | 0 | 100% |
| Medium issues | 4 | ≤3 | 75% |

**Assessment**: Strong progress on topics and concepts. Arguments section needs attention (only 1 of 5 target). Medium issues slightly above target.

## Changes Applied (Tier 1)

*No changes applied* — insufficient data for first tune-system run. The skill requires 5+ data points showing consistent patterns before making automatic adjustments.

## Recommendations (Tier 2)

### 1. Adjust Daily Cadences to Realistic Schedule

- **Proposed change**: Change `validate-all`, `check-links`, `optimistic-review`, `pessimistic-review` cadences from 1 day to 3-4 days
- **Rationale**: With /evolve running 2-3 times per week, 1-day cadences guarantee constant overdue status. A 3-day cadence matches actual execution opportunity.
- **Risk**: Low — maintenance tasks will still run regularly
- **To approve**: Edit `evolution-state.yaml` cadences section

### 2. Run Optimistic Review Soon

- **Proposed change**: Next /evolve session should prioritize optimistic-review (3 days overdue)
- **Rationale**: Pessimistic review ran today; balance needed
- **Risk**: Low
- **To approve**: Will happen automatically via overdue injection, or manually invoke `/optimistic-review`

### 3. Create Task for Decoherence Content

- **Proposed change**: Add P2 task: "Address decoherence objection in published content"
- **Rationale**: Issue raised twice in pessimistic reviews; research exists but not synthesized
- **Risk**: Low
- **To approve**: Add to todo.md Active Tasks

## Items for Human Review (Tier 3)

### 1. Arguments Section Underdeveloped

- **Issue observed**: Only 1 of 5 target arguments written (20% complete vs 50%+ for topics/concepts)
- **Why human needed**: Deciding which arguments to write is a strategic choice
- **Suggested action**: Consider adding argument tasks to queue (against functionalism, against eliminativism, for consciousness mattering morally)

### 2. Task Chain Generation

- **Issue observed**: `pending_articles` contains 2 research files awaiting article synthesis, but no chain tasks were generated in last replenishment
- **Why human needed**: May indicate gap in replenish-queue logic or intentional behavior
- **Suggested action**: Review if chain tasks should auto-generate from pending_articles

### 3. Recurring Review Issues

- **Issue observed**: Some issues (decoherence, MWI rejection) raised multiple times without resolution
- **Why human needed**: May need human prioritization to ensure critical issues get addressed
- **Suggested action**: Consider promoting issue-resolution tasks to P1 when raised 2+ times

## Next Tuning Session

- **Recommended**: 2026-02-07 (30 days out)
- **Focus areas**:
  - With more data, assess if cadence adjustments are warranted
  - Track if Tier 2 recommendations were adopted and their effects
  - Monitor arguments progress toward target
  - Evaluate task chain generation effectiveness
