**Date**: 2026-01-29
**Article**: [Analytic Idealism](/concepts/analytic-idealism/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-20](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-20-analytic-idealism/)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Dissociation section response to critics was thin**: The original text said Kastrup "argues the conceptual structure is sound"—an assertion, not an argument. **Resolution**: Expanded to articulate the actual argument: dissociation is a coherent psychological phenomenon (perspective fragmenting into subjectively separate viewpoints) that doesn't depend on brains for its conceptual coherence; brains are merely the observable correlate.

2. **Empirical distinguishability section was vague**: The phrase "Future quantum experiments on observer-dependence might distinguish these mechanisms" was handwaving. **Resolution**: Tightened to acknowledge the difficulty while being more precise: "A decisive experiment would require scenarios where dualism and idealism make different predictions about intersubjective coordination—difficult to construct, but not obviously impossible."

3. **Materialist position was strawmanned slightly**: The article treated the hard problem as accepted fact without acknowledging that eliminativists reject its premises entirely. **Resolution**: Added brief acknowledgment that some eliminativists "deny there's any problem here—they reject qualia as folk concepts to be outgrown rather than explained."

### Low Issues (Not Addressed)

1. **Indexical questions aren't unique to idealism**: The article's indexical critique of idealism applies equally to dualism. Decided not to address—the article's purpose is to critique idealism from the Map's perspective, not to catalog all frameworks' indexical challenges. A comprehensive treatment would belong in a dedicated article on indexical identity.

2. **Buddhist critique could be more precise about svabhāva**: The Madhyamaka section could note that the rejection is specifically about "inherent existence." Decided not to expand—the previous review already added Buddhist complications, and further precision risks the article becoming a primer on Buddhist philosophy rather than an analytic idealism article.

### Counterarguments Considered

1. **Eliminativist rejection of hard problem**: Acknowledged in text rather than fully engaged. The article takes consciousness seriously as its starting point (aligned with tenets), so a full engagement with eliminativism belongs elsewhere.

2. **Dissociation model skepticism**: Strengthened the response to make Kastrup's actual argument explicit.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- "What Idealism Gets Right" section—philosophically generous treatment of idealism's genuine contributions
- The witness consciousness alternative interpretation—"disengaging from neural interface rather than merging with cosmic whole"
- The interface question as a distinctive Map contribution
- Connection between metaphysics and agency/freedom
- Appropriately measured tone—doesn't overclaim

### Enhancements Made

1. Strengthened dissociation section with actual argument rather than bare assertion
2. Tightened empirical distinguishability claims to be more epistemically honest
3. Acknowledged eliminativist position on hard problem

### Cross-links Added

- [process-philosophy](/concepts/process-philosophy/) — Added to Further Reading as a related alternative framework

## Remaining Items

None. The article has reached a stable state. The two low issues noted above are acknowledged but appropriately deferred—addressing them would expand the article's scope beyond its purpose.

## Stability Notes

This is the second deep review of this article. The first review (2026-01-20) added substantial new content: Buddhist complications, witness consciousness connection, empirical distinguishability section, and multiple cross-links. This review made targeted improvements to strengthen existing arguments rather than adding new sections.

The article is now approaching stability. Philosophical disagreements from adversarial personas (eliminativists rejecting the hard problem, MWI defenders finding indexical arguments unsatisfying) represent bedrock philosophical differences, not fixable flaws in the article. Future reviews should not re-flag these as critical issues.
