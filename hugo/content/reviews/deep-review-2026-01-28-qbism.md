title: Deep Review - QBism (Quantum Bayesianism)
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-01-28
**Article**: [QBism (Quantum Bayesianism)](/concepts/qbism/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article is well-structured with all required sections, no factual errors, no internal contradictions, and follows the style guide.

### Medium Issues Found
- **MWI indexical objection under-developed**: The article stated the indexical concern but didn't acknowledge MWI defenders have responses. **Resolution**: Added paragraph engaging with the MWI defender position that indexical questions are "selection effects" while maintaining the Map's position that indexical identity requires explanation.

- **"Experience" vs "correlate" distinction**: The article assumes the distinction between "experiencing" outcomes and "correlating with" outcomes is meaningful. **Resolution**: This is a bedrock disagreement with eliminativists—the Map's dualist tenets commit to this distinction being real. No change needed; the article is correctly aligned with site perspective.

### Low Issues Found
- **Fuchs citation needed**: The claim that Fuchs "explicitly refuses to define agency" needed citation. **Resolution**: Added specific citation to Fuchs 2017 where he describes agents as "the most basic category."

- **Consciousness-collapse fringe status**: Could note these are non-mainstream interpretations. **Resolution**: Deferred—adding this would be tangential to the article's purpose.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminativist objection** ("all physics leaves consciousness unexplained"): **Resolution**: Addressed by adding explanation of why QBism is uniquely vulnerable—other interpretations don't *require* consciousness at their foundations. QBism alone needs experiencing agents to make sense, making the gap structural rather than incidental.

- **MWI defender response to indexical concern**: **Resolution**: Added acknowledgment that MWI defenders view indexical questions as "selection effects" comparable to personal identity questions, while maintaining that the Map takes indexical identity as requiring explanation (linking to haecceity).

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- The "Agent Problem" section structure and argumentation
- The "First-Person Gap" section connecting to haecceity
- The balanced "What QBism Gets Right" / "What QBism Misses" structure
- The key insight: "has located the mystery rather than dissolved it"
- The nuanced tenet connections in "Relation to Site Perspective"
- The existing cross-links to measurement-problem, relational-quantum-mechanics, haecceity, hard-problem-of-consciousness

### Enhancements Made
- Strengthened citation for Fuchs's treatment of agency as primitive (Fuchs 2017)
- Added explanation of why "consciousness unexplained" is particularly damaging to QBism specifically (structural vs incidental gap)
- Added paragraph on MWI defenders' response to indexical objection with Map's rejoinder
- Added wikilink to [many-worlds](/concepts/many-worlds/) concept page

### Cross-links Added
- [many-worlds](/concepts/many-worlds/) (new link in Versus Many-Worlds section)

## Word Count
- Before: 1610 words
- After: 1757 words (+147 words, +9%)
- Status: 70% of soft threshold (2500), well within limits

## Remaining Items
None. All identified issues were either addressed or represent bedrock philosophical disagreements that should not be "fixed."

## Stability Notes
The following represent fundamental philosophical disagreements rather than fixable problems:

1. **Eliminativists will object** that the "experience vs correlate" distinction begs the question—this is the dualism tenet, not a flaw in the article.

2. **MWI defenders will find the indexical objection unmotivated**—they view "why this branch?" as no more mysterious than "why am I this person?" The article now acknowledges this response while maintaining the Map's position that indexical identity is meaningful.

3. **Dennett-style functionalists** will object to treating Nagel's "what it is like" framework as uncontroversial—the article presupposes this framework because the Map's tenets commit to it.

These are not issues to re-flag in future reviews. The article is correctly aligned with site tenets; philosophical opponents will always disagree with dualist premises.
