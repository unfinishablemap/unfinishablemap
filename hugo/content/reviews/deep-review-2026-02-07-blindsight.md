**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Article**: [Blindsight](/concepts/blindsight/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-24](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-24-blindsight/)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Factual error: D.B.'s surgery reason**: Article stated surgery was "to control seizures" but D.B.'s surgery was to remove a vascular malformation (arteriovenous malformation) in his right occipital lobe.
   - **Resolution**: Corrected to "surgical removal of a vascular malformation in his right occipital lobe."

2. **Misplaced section anchor**: The `{#baseline-cognition-pattern}` anchor was on the "Alternative Interpretations" heading instead of the "Fits the Baseline Cognition Pattern" heading, causing the named-anchor link in the opening paragraph to land on the wrong section.
   - **Resolution**: Moved anchor to the correct section heading.

3. **Unverifiable accuracy figures**: "80-90% accuracy on location discrimination" could not be confirmed from accessible summaries of Weiskrantz et al. (1974).
   - **Resolution**: Softened to "well above chance" with qualitative description of D.B.'s performance.

4. **Blind insight section uncited and cross-domain limitation unacknowledged**: The "Double Dissociation: Blind Insight" section had no citation, didn't identify the paradigm (artificial grammar learning, not visual perception), and didn't acknowledge the cross-domain limitation of the double dissociation.
   - **Resolution**: Added Scott et al. (2014) citation, noted the paradigm, and qualified the inferential force of the cross-domain double dissociation.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Missing engagement with Phillips (2021)**: The strongest current challenge to the orthodox blindsight interpretation was unaddressed. Phillips argues blindsight patients have qualitatively degraded conscious vision with conservative response criteria.
   - **Resolution**: Added Phillips (2021) discussion under Alternative Interpretation 2 with citation.

2. **Lau & Passingham (2006) mischaracterized**: Described as developing "signal detection frameworks distinguishing perceptual sensitivity from metacognitive sensitivity" when the paper is actually about relative blindsight in normal observers via metacontrast masking.
   - **Resolution**: Rewritten to accurately describe what the paper demonstrates.

3. **"Identical processing" language overstated**: Article repeatedly claimed "identical neural processing" in blindsight vs. normal vision, but the collicular and geniculostriate pathways use different architectures.
   - **Resolution**: Changed to "functionally similar" throughout, acknowledged architectural differences.

4. **Occam's Razor tenet not connected**: Four of five tenets were addressed in Relation to Site Perspective but the fifth (Occam's Razor Has Limits) was missing.
   - **Resolution**: Added brief connection to the Occam's Razor tenet.

5. **Circular epiphenomenalism argument**: The argument "if consciousness were epiphenomenal, why would its presence/absence make this functional difference?" begs the question — an epiphenomenalist attributes the functional difference to physical pathway differences.
   - **Resolution**: Rewritten to acknowledge the physicalist explanation and argue that the correlation between phenomenal presence and cognitive flexibility is better explained by causal contribution than coincidence.

6. **No cross-link to higher-order theories**: HOT provides a specific physicalist explanation for the blindsight dissociation that was unmentioned.
   - **Resolution**: Added HOT cross-link and brief explanation in the baseline cognition section.

7. **Missing blind insight citation in References**: Scott et al. (2014) was not in the reference list.
   - **Resolution**: Added full citation.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Phillips (2021) degraded-conscious-vision argument**: Now explicitly engaged under Alternative Interpretation 2.
- **Higher-order theory explanation**: Now mentioned as alternative to GWT in the baseline cognition section.
- **"Computations are NOT identical" objection**: Addressed by qualifying "identical" to "functionally similar" throughout and acknowledging architectural differences.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Clear opening summary that survives truncation
- Three-response concession-then-pivot structure in dualism section
- Double dissociation analysis identifying three separable systems
- Closing paragraph's honest epistemic humility ("The debate continues")
- Patient phenomenological reports treated as genuine evidence
- Quantum connection flagged as speculative with appropriate hedging
- Two-column format for what unconscious vision can/cannot do
- "Which one?" vs. "what is it?" distillation of baseline cognition

### Enhancements Made

1. **Phillips (2021) engagement**: Added the strongest current challenge to orthodox blindsight interpretation
2. **Higher-order theories**: Added as alternative framework alongside GWT
3. **Occam's Razor tenet**: All five tenets now connected
4. **Blind insight rigor**: Properly cited, paradigm identified, cross-domain limitation acknowledged
5. **Citation accuracy**: Corrected Lau & Passingham characterization, added Scott et al. and Phillips citations
6. **Factual correction**: D.B.'s surgery reason corrected from seizures to vascular malformation
7. **Anchor fix**: Named-anchor now points to correct section
8. **Epiphenomenalism argument**: Strengthened by addressing the circular reasoning

- After: 2602 words (+38)
- Status: 104% of soft threshold (2500) — marginal increase despite significant content additions, offset by prose tightening throughout

## Remaining Items

None. All identified critical and medium issues were addressed.

## Stability Notes

- The article has reached good stability after two reviews. The core structure, argumentation strategy, and voice are strong. Future reviews should not require major restructuring.
- Philosophical disagreements (materialists finding the dualist argument unconvincing, illusionists rejecting phenomenal realism) are bedrock disagreements, not fixable issues.
- The "identical vs. functionally similar processing" qualification is now settled — the article correctly acknowledges architectural differences while maintaining the dualist argument.
- Phillips (2021) is now engaged; future reviews should not re-flag this as missing unless the engagement is substantively inadequate.
