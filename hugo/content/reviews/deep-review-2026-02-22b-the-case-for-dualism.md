title: Deep Review - The Case for Dualism
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-22
**Article**: [The Case for Dualism](/concepts/the-case-for-dualism/)
**Previous review**: [2026-02-22](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-22-the-case-for-dualism/)
**Word count**: 2219 → 2274 (+55 words, +2.5%)
**Review context**: Cross-review considering parsimony void insights.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None. All attributions verified (Levine, Jackson, Chalmers, Kripke, Nagel, Brentano, Searle, Hasker, Tallis, Tegmark, Huemer, Sober, Zanotti, Kastrup). No misattribution, dropped qualifiers, or source/Map conflation detected.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing parsimony void cross-link**: The parsimony section made three solid philosophical points (precondition unmet, simplicity dimensions conflict, academic consensus) but didn't reference the deeper void-level concern that parsimony may be an architecturally embedded cognitive bias rather than just a philosophically limited principle. **Resolution**: Added two sentences linking to the parsimony void article, noting that the preference for simpler theories may reflect cognitive architecture rather than evidence.
- **Grammatical error in quantum section**: "The opening the Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet requires" was missing "that". **Resolution**: Fixed to "The opening that the..."

### Low Issues
- Heterophenomenology not discussed in body text (only in frontmatter concepts). Noted in previous reviews; minor gap given summary nature of article.
- Jackson quote ("should be addressed really seriously if you are a physicalist") exact publication source not cited. Consistent with Jackson's known stance; left as-is per previous review.

### Counterarguments Considered
- All six pessimistic personas engaged. No new substantive concerns beyond those identified and resolved in the two previous reviews (2026-02-21, 2026-02-22).
- **Eliminative materialist**: Convergence argument's shared phenomenal starting point acknowledged in text.
- **Dennett/functionalist**: Physicalist responses section fair and substantive.
- **Quantum skeptic**: Decoherence handled with appropriate caveats and specific biological example.
- **MWI defender**: Brief treatment defers to dedicated article. Bedrock disagreement.
- **Empiricist**: Five falsifiability conditions well-calibrated.
- **Buddhist/no-self**: Unity argument assumes unified subject. Bedrock commitment.

## Attribution Accuracy Check

All attributions verified:
- [x] Claims attributed to correct authors
- [x] Qualifiers preserved (conceivability "critical question," circularity charge "unresolved")
- [x] No overstated positions (Chalmers "argues," Jackson "acknowledges")
- [x] Source/Map separation maintained throughout
- [x] No self-contradictions detected
- [x] PhilPapers survey data verified in previous review

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- **Convergence structure**: The master argument remains the article's distinctive contribution
- **Honest concessions**: Circularity charge unresolved, pairing problem "partial," conservation law responses "promising but contested"
- **Objection/response table**: Excellent for LLM consumption
- **"What Would Challenge This View?"**: Models intellectual honesty with five specific conditions
- **Water analogy**: Effective illustration in explanatory gap section
- **Illusionism critique**: Tallis quote and the "seeming is itself the phenomenon" argument
- **Quantum framing**: Correctly positioned as undermining causal closure rather than proving dualism
- **Idealism differentiation**: Three concrete reasons favouring dualism over idealism

### Enhancements Made
- Added parsimony void insight (~55 words) connecting philosophical parsimony arguments to the deeper cognitive-bias concern
- Fixed grammatical error in quantum section
- Added [the parsimony void](/voids/epistemological-limits-occams-razor/) to Further Reading and frontmatter related_articles

### Cross-links Added
- [epistemological-limits-occams-razor](/voids/epistemological-limits-occams-razor/) (parsimony section, Further Reading, frontmatter)

## Remaining Items

None. The article is well-developed after three reviews and the improvements are minor, targeted enhancements.

## Stability Notes

- All stability notes from previous reviews remain valid: unity-of-consciousness assumes unified subject (bedrock), MWI indexical argument (bedrock), convergence argument's shared phenomenal premise (acknowledged), idealism differentiation (bedrock).
- The parsimony void cross-link adds a deeper dimension to the parsimony response. Future reviews should NOT expand this further — the parsimony section now covers philosophical arguments, academic consensus, and cognitive-bias concerns. Additional detail belongs in the dedicated articles, not here.
- **Article approaching stability**: Three reviews in two days with diminishing changes (−293 → +179 → +55 words). The article has reached a mature state. Future reviews should only flag genuinely new issues, not re-examine settled material.
- Word count at 2274, comfortably within the concepts/ soft threshold of 2500.
