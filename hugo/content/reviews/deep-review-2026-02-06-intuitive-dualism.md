title: Deep Review - Intuitive Dualism
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-06
**Article**: [Intuitive Dualism](/concepts/intuitive-dualism/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-24](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-24-intuitive-dualism/)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Six adversarial personas applied. This is the fourth review of this article (second today); it has stabilized well. This pass focused on integration with the new [cognitive-science-of-dualism](/topics/cognitive-science-of-dualism/) topic article.

### Critical Issues Found
- None

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing cross-link to cognitive-science-of-dualism topic**: The concept article referenced research notes (`cognitive-science-dualism-2026-01-15`) but not the full topic article that provides broader methodological context (methodological materialism, embodied cognition, predictive processing). Added to frontmatter topics and inline in Two-System View section.
  - Resolution: Added `[cognitive-science-of-dualism](/topics/cognitive-science-of-dualism/)` to frontmatter and inline cross-link
- **Missing cross-link to theory-of-mind**: Willard & Norenzayan (2013) mentalizing pathway discussed without linking to the dedicated theory-of-mind concept article.
  - Resolution: Added `[theory-of-mind](/concepts/theory-of-mind/)` wikilink on "mentalizing" reference and to frontmatter concepts
- **Missing cross-link to embodied-cognition**: Process philosophy section discusses embodiment without linking to the concept article that explores this in depth.
  - Resolution: Added `[embodied-cognition](/concepts/embodied-cognition/)` inline in process philosophy section and to frontmatter concepts

### Counterarguments Considered
- All bedrock disagreements from previous reviews remain stable:
  - Eliminative materialist: "irreducibly mental elements" in Buddhist section — bedrock disagreement
  - Nagarjuna/Madhyamaka: same phrase challenged from opposite direction — bedrock disagreement
  - Dennett: determinacy challenge to Frankish — low priority, argument stands independently

## Attribution Accuracy Check

All attributions verified in earlier 2026-02-06 review. No new content claims added — only cross-links. Clean.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Genetic fallacy argument — excellent analogy with folk physics
- Symmetric problem — powerful rhetorical move
- Process philosophy integration — genuinely novel synthesis
- "Explaining the belief doesn't explain the explanandum" — concise and devastating
- "What Would Challenge This View?" section — model of intellectual honesty
- Contemplative evidence — empirical dimension most articles lack

### Enhancements Made
- Added `[cognitive-science-of-dualism](/topics/cognitive-science-of-dualism/)` cross-link (topic article providing methodological framing)
- Added `[theory-of-mind](/concepts/theory-of-mind/)` cross-link (mentalizing pathway)
- Added `[embodied-cognition](/concepts/embodied-cognition/)` cross-link (process philosophy connection)
- Updated Further Reading with two new entries

### Cross-links Added
- [cognitive-science-of-dualism](/topics/cognitive-science-of-dualism/) — broader methodological context for cognitive science findings
- [theory-of-mind](/concepts/theory-of-mind/) — mentalizing as pathway to dualism (Willard & Norenzayan)
- [embodied-cognition](/concepts/embodied-cognition/) — body-mind integration relevant to process philosophy section

## Remaining Items

None. Article remains stable. The cross-linking improvements connect it to the newer topic article that provides the broader methodological framing for the cognitive science evidence discussed here.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed four times (2026-01-20, 2026-01-24, 2026-02-06 x2). It is fully stable:

- Core arguments are sound and well-expressed
- Attribution accuracy is clean across all 10 cited sources
- No critical issues found in any of the four reviews
- Bedrock disagreements (eliminative materialist vs "irreducibly mental elements"; Madhyamaka vs same) are philosophical standoffs, not flaws
- Article is 1,832 words (73% of 2,500 soft limit) — well-proportioned
- The cognitive-science-of-dualism integration context has been addressed through cross-links rather than content duplication
- Future reviews should only check for new content problems, not re-examine stable sections
