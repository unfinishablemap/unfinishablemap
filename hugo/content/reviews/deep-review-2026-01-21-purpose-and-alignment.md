## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Missing Illusionist Challenge section**: The article accepted phenomenal value realism without engaging with the strongest physicalist objection. **Resolution**: Added comprehensive "The Illusionist Challenge" section with regress response, practical asymmetry argument, and contemplative evidence.
- **Missing falsifiability section**: No "What Would Challenge This View?" section. **Resolution**: Added section with five falsifiable conditions.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Incomplete tenet coverage**: "Relation to Site Perspective" only covered 2 of 5 tenets (Occam's Razor, Dualism). **Resolution**: Expanded to cover all 5 tenets with substantive analysis including Minimal Quantum Interaction (decoherence implications), Bidirectional Interaction (real vs. apparent agency), and No Many Worlds (haecceity connection).
- **No contemplative evidence**: Missing engagement with witness consciousness and Buddhist perspectives. **Resolution**: Added "Contemplative Evidence" section covering witness consciousness, Buddhist complication, and jhana states.
- **No process philosophy perspective**: Missing engagement with Whitehead's framework. **Resolution**: Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section connecting actual occasions, concrescence, and subjective aim to alignment.

### Counterarguments Considered
- Illusionism: If phenomenal consciousness is illusory, experiential alignment targets nothing real. Addressed via regress response and practical asymmetry.
- Buddhist critique: Attachment to experiential quality causes suffering. Addressed via "The Buddhist Complication" subsection.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Strong opening summary connecting alignment to ancient questions about purpose
- Clear preferentist critique structure
- Excellent valence section with comparative table
- Robust experiential alignment framework

### Enhancements Made
- Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section (regress response, practical asymmetry, contemplative evidence)
- Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section (actual occasions, concrescence, thin preferences)
- Added "Contemplative Evidence" section (witness consciousness, Buddhist complication, jhana states)
- Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section with 5 falsifiability conditions
- Expanded "Relation to Site Perspective" from 2 to all 5 tenets with substantive analysis
- Added 5 new cross-links (illusionism, introspection, witness-consciousness, haecceity, buddhism-and-dualism)
- Added 5 new references
