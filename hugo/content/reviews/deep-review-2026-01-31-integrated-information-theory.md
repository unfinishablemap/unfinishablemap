title: Deep Review - Integrated Information Theory
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Article**: [Integrated Information Theory](/concepts/integrated-information-theory/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-20](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-20-integrated-information-theory/)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article is comprehensive and well-structured after the previous deep review.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Kerskens & Pérez study framing**: The study was presented as established fact. Added skeptical qualifier ("remains preliminary and disputed").
- **Missing causal-interface cross-link**: IIT's lack of causal efficacy connects directly to the causal-interface void. Added cross-link.

### Low Issues Found
None requiring action.

### Counterarguments Considered
All major counterarguments were already addressed in the previous review:
- Illusionist challenge (dedicated section exists)
- Process philosophy alternative (dedicated section exists)
- Expander graph problem (dedicated section exists)
- COGITATE empirical results (comprehensive coverage exists)

The article engages fairly with critics while maintaining the Map's perspective.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear axiom → postulate → implication structure
- Fair treatment of IIT as serious competitor theory
- Comprehensive COGITATE experiment coverage with "neither theory emerged unscathed"
- Strong temporal consciousness gap argument linking to Map's quantum framework
- Process Philosophy Resonance section showing Whitehead comparison
- Illusionist Challenge section with response and counter-response

### Enhancements Made
- Added skeptical framing to Kerskens & Pérez quantum entanglement claim
- Added [causal-interface](/voids/causal-interface/) cross-link in "Where IIT Conflicts" section
- Added causal-interface to related_articles frontmatter
- Condensed C. elegans UAL paragraph to maintain length neutrality

### Cross-links Added
- [causal-interface](/voids/causal-interface/) (in body and frontmatter)

## Length Status

- Before: 2906 words (116% of 2500 target)
- After: 2919 words (117% of 2500 target)
- Mode: Length-neutral (additions balanced with condensation)

## Remaining Items

None. The article has reached good stability after two deep reviews.

## Stability Notes

This is the second deep review. The article has converged well:
- No critical issues remain
- Major philosophical objections are engaged (illusionism, process philosophy, expander graphs)
- Empirical content is current (COGITATE 2025 results included)
- Cross-linking is comprehensive

The previous review (2026-01-20) added substantial content including falsifiability section, process philosophy resonance, and illusionist challenge. This review made only targeted improvements, indicating the article has reached stability.

**Bedrock disagreements acknowledged**: Eliminative materialists and illusionists will always reject IIT's phenomenological starting point. MWI defenders may find the Map's critique of IIT's passive stance unpersuasive. These are philosophical standoffs, not fixable flaws.
