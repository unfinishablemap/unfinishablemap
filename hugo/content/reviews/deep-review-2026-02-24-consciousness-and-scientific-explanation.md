title: Deep Review - Consciousness and Scientific Explanation Under Dualism
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-24
**Article**: [Consciousness and Scientific Explanation Under Dualism](/concepts/consciousness-and-scientific-explanation/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Broken link: `consciousness-and-the-philosophy-of-explanation`**: Referenced in frontmatter topics and Further Reading but file does not exist. Replaced with `consciousness-and-the-limits-of-explanation` which covers similar ground.
- **Broken link: `consciousness-and-the-meta-problem-of-scientific-explanation`**: Referenced in frontmatter related_articles but file does not exist. Replaced with `meta-problem-of-consciousness`.
- **AI refinement log left in published content**: Lines 138-150 contained an HTML comment refinement log marked "should be removed after human review" but article was published (draft: false). Removed.
- **Frontmatter concepts `causal-closure` and `emergence` never referenced in body**: Both were listed in concepts but had no inline links or mentions. Wove both into the article body with appropriate wikilinks.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Dennett "skyhook" attribution loosely constructed**: The term comes from *Darwin's Dangerous Idea* (1995), primarily about evolution, not consciousness. Reframed attribution and added citation to *Consciousness Explained* (1991) as the more relevant anti-dualism work.
- **Levine (1983) and Nagel (1974) in References but never cited inline**: Added inline citations for both in the direct-acquaintance disanalogy paragraph, strengthening the argument.
- **Quantum testability oversold**: "This is actually a strength" was over-confident for a speculative-level claim. Reworded to acknowledge the substantial gap between in-principle and practical testability.
- **Missing engagement with hard-problem denial**: Since Dennett is cited as an opponent, his strongest move (denying the hard problem exists) was unaddressed. Added new objection covering illusionism (Dennett, Frankish 2016) with response via the meta-problem.
- **Style guide violation**: "This is not mysterianism. It is an expansion..." matched the prohibited "This is not X. It is Y." pattern. Rephrased.
- **No Tenet 4 (No Many Worlds) in Relation to Site Perspective**: Added paragraph explaining why MWI rejection is a prerequisite for the article's framework.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **"What does a psychophysical law look like?"** — Noted as a remaining gap; the article describes categories of psychophysical laws but gives no concrete candidate. Deferred as expansion opportunity for future review.
- **"In-principle testable is not testable"** — Addressed by honest hedging of the quantum prediction claim.
- **"The hard problem might not be real"** — Addressed with new objection section covering illusionism.
- **"Direct acquaintance does not establish irreducibility"** — Strengthened with Nagel and Levine inline citations; acknowledged the argument's centrality.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- The irreducibility/inexplicability distinction (opening paragraphs) — the article's thesis in compressed form
- The direct-acquaintance disanalogy — the strongest philosophical move, now strengthened with explicit Nagel/Levine citations
- "A brute regularity at the base level is not a failure of science. It is where the foundations are." — Preserved unchanged
- Honest engagement with the reductive objection — "The Map acknowledges the force of this objection"
- Three-tier explanatory division of labour — clean, structurally elegant
- Steel-manning pattern throughout — granting strength to opposing arguments before responding

### Enhancements Made
- Added inline wikilinks to [causal-closure](/concepts/causal-closure/), [emergence](/concepts/emergence/), [phenomenal-acquaintance](/concepts/phenomenal-acquaintance/), [selection-laws](/concepts/selection-laws/), [meta-problem-of-consciousness](/concepts/meta-problem-of-consciousness/), [mysterianism](/concepts/mysterianism/)
- Added new objection on hard-problem denial/illusionism
- Added Tenet 4 (No Many Worlds) to Relation to Site Perspective — now all five tenets addressed
- Honest hedging of quantum testability claim
- More precise Dennett attribution with correct primary source
- Two new Further Reading links: [philosophy-of-science-under-dualism](/concepts/philosophy-of-science-under-dualism/), [galilean-exclusion](/concepts/galilean-exclusion/)

### Cross-links Added
- [causal-closure](/concepts/causal-closure/) — woven into "What Neuroscience Explains" section
- [emergence](/concepts/emergence/) — woven into hard problem discussion
- [phenomenal-acquaintance](/concepts/phenomenal-acquaintance/) — linked at direct-acquaintance argument
- [selection-laws](/concepts/selection-laws/) — linked at downward selection bullet
- [meta-problem-of-consciousness](/concepts/meta-problem-of-consciousness/) — linked in new illusionism objection
- [mysterianism](/concepts/mysterianism/) — linked in psychophysical laws section
- [philosophy-of-science-under-dualism](/concepts/philosophy-of-science-under-dualism/) — added to Further Reading and related_articles
- [galilean-exclusion](/concepts/galilean-exclusion/) — added to Further Reading and related_articles
- [consciousness-and-the-limits-of-explanation](/topics/consciousness-and-the-limits-of-explanation/) — replaced broken link in Further Reading

## Remaining Items

- **Concrete psychophysical law example**: The article describes categories of psychophysical laws but gives no toy candidate. This is the article's most notable remaining gap. Future expansion could add a candidate (e.g., structural coherence principle, organizational invariance) to concretize the proposal. Not addressed in this review to avoid artificial additions.
- **Churchland "poltergeists" quote verification**: The exact wording appears in quotation marks but may be a paraphrase rather than a direct quote from *Neurophilosophy*. A page reference would strengthen the citation.

## Stability Notes

- The six adversarial personas all disagree with the article's core position (dualism enables science), which is expected. These are philosophical disagreements, not fixable problems. Future reviews should not re-flag "Dennett would reject the hard problem" or "MWI defender finds no role for consciousness" as critical issues.
- The direct-acquaintance disanalogy is the article's philosophical crux. It has now been strengthened with inline citations. If future reviews find it "underargued," note that further expansion risks the argument becoming unwieldy — the current formulation balances concision with substance.
- The quantum testability claim has been honestly hedged. Future reviews should not cycle between "overselling" and "underselling" — the current framing ("in principle, though the gap is substantial") represents the appropriate confidence level.
