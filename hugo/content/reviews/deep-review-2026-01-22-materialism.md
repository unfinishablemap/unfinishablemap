title: Deep Review - Against Materialism
topics: []

**Date**: 2026-01-22
**Article**: [Against Materialism](/concepts/materialism/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-07](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-07-materialism/)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
1. **Missing "Relation to Site Perspective" section**: Required by style guide but absent. **Resolution**: Added comprehensive section connecting to Tenets 1, 2, 3, and 5.
2. **No References section**: Multiple empirical claims (Tegmark, Hagan et al., Princeton study) lacked citations. **Resolution**: Added full References section with 9 academic citations.
3. **No falsifiability conditions**: Empiricist critique that the position appeared unfalsifiable. **Resolution**: Added Falsifiability section with specific expected and challenging findings.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Illusionist challenge underaddressed**: The article mentioned illusionism but didn't engage with the regress response. **Resolution**: Added illusionist regress argument explaining why representation-for-a-subject just is phenomenal consciousness.
2. **Missing cross-links to new content**: No links to consciousness-as-amplifier or baseline-cognition frameworks. **Resolution**: Added paragraph connecting quantum selection to amplification framework and functional explanation.
3. **No contemplative perspectives**: Buddhist and meditative evidence relevant to first-person consciousness claims. **Resolution**: Added Contemplative Perspectives section on vipassanā and phenomenal discrimination.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Zombie intuition critique** (Dennett): Addressed via water analogy response already in text—preserved
- **Decoherence as decisive** (Tegmark): Already well-addressed with Hagan et al. response—preserved
- **Eliminativist regress**: Now addressed with new illusionist regress paragraph
- **Many-worlds bypass**: Acknowledged as tenet position rather than argued here

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent opening summary that front-loads the key claim
- Clear tripartite taxonomy of materialism (eliminative, reductive, non-reductive)
- Compelling epiphenomenalism self-defeat argument
- Strong quantum mechanics section with nuanced decoherence response
- Effective "billiard ball" framing against intuitive materialism
- Chalmers' hard problem presentation

### Enhancements Made
1. Expanded illusionist response with regress argument (~100 words)
2. Added consciousness-as-amplifier/baseline-cognition connection (~80 words)
3. Added Falsifiability section (~200 words)
4. Added Contemplative Perspectives section (~150 words)
5. Added Relation to Site Perspective section (~250 words)
6. Added Further Reading section with 6 links
7. Added References section with 9 citations

## Remaining Items

None. All critical and medium issues addressed. The article now meets style guide requirements and integrates with recent Map content on consciousness-intelligence relationships.
