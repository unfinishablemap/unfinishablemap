title: Deep Review - Locality and Mind-Matter Interaction
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-25
**Article**: [Locality and Mind-Matter Interaction](/concepts/locality/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-27](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-27-locality/)

## Context

The article was substantially rewritten on 2026-02-20 (after the last deep review on 2026-01-27). The rewrite replaced a flawed "physical law coordinates things" analogy in Response 1 with an argument from quantum non-locality, and replaced a tangential simulation argument in Response 3 with an independently motivated argument about contested spacetime assumptions. This review is the first deep review of the revised content.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The 2026-02-20 rewrite addressed the major structural problems identified in prior reviews.

### Medium Issues Found

- **Response 1 conflated correlation with causation**: The argument cited quantum entanglement as evidence against strict locality, but didn't acknowledge that entanglement correlations are not causal transmissions (no-signaling theorem). This left the argument vulnerable to the objection that entanglement and consciousness-causation are fundamentally different. → Added two sentences clarifying the distinction: entanglement is not a model for non-local causation but evidence that the universe's structure includes non-local phenomena.

- **Uncited references (Penrose 1994, Stapp 2011)**: These were leftovers from the pre-2026-02-20 version, no longer cited in the text. → Removed to keep references honest.

- **AI refinement log left in article**: A detailed HTML comment (13 lines) from the 2026-02-20 rewrite was left for "human review" but had been sitting for over a month. → Removed.

- **Bare "quantum-entanglement" in concepts frontmatter**: A bare string among otherwise wikilinked concepts, pointing to a non-existent article. → Replaced with `[causal-closure](/concepts/causal-closure/)`, which is directly relevant and exists.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Dennett (hard-nosed physicalist)**: Entanglement correlations are constrained by no-signaling—they're not a license for arbitrary non-local causation. → Addressed by adding the no-signaling clarification to Response 1.
- **Tegmark (quantum skeptic)**: Real quantum non-locality is precisely constrained; the kind of free-form "consciousness reaching multiple sites" dualism requires is nothing like entanglement. → The article now explicitly states entanglement is not a model for consciousness but evidence against universal locality as a constraint.
- **Churchland (eliminative materialist)**: The article assumes consciousness exists as a causal agent. → Bedrock disagreement; the Map's tenets posit consciousness as real and causally efficacious.
- **Deutsch (MWI defender)**: MWI dissolves locality problems differently. → Bedrock disagreement per Tenet 4.
- **Popper (empiricist)**: No testable predictions. → The article correctly positions itself as conceptual clarification, not empirical proposal.
- **Nagarjuna (Buddhist)**: Both mind and matter lack inherent existence; the locality problem dissolves by recognizing neither is a self-existing entity. → Interesting alternative dissolution but outside the Map's dualist framework.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Three-pronged response structure (inconsistent standard / assumes too little / contested assumptions) is well-organized and each response targets a different assumption
- Opening summary front-loads the core issue and response effectively—survives truncation
- The 2026-02-20 rewrite substantially improved both Response 1 and Response 3
- Binding problem comparison section is insightful: entanglement may *help* with binding rather than hinder it
- Epistemic humility in Relation to Site Perspective ("don't *prove*... they show that")
- Response 2's phenomenological observation about visual experience richness is compelling

### Enhancements Made

- Tightened Response 1's entanglement argument with no-signaling distinction (preempts strongest counter)
- Added `[causal-closure](/concepts/causal-closure/)` cross-link in Further Reading and concepts frontmatter
- Cleaned up stale references and process artifacts

### Cross-links Added

- [causal-closure](/concepts/causal-closure/) (new—directly relevant: rejecting causal closure creates room for non-physical causation)

### Cross-links Verified

- [brain-interface-boundary](/concepts/brain-interface-boundary/), [pairing-problem](/concepts/pairing-problem/), [binding-problem](/concepts/binding-problem/), [interactionist-dualism](/concepts/interactionist-dualism/), [quantum-consciousness](/concepts/quantum-consciousness/) — all exist and correctly linked

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues addressed in this review.

## Stability Notes

This article has reached good stability. The 2026-02-20 rewrite fixed the structural issues from earlier versions, and this review made only targeted precision improvements (no-signaling clarification, reference cleanup). The three-response structure is sound and well-argued.

The following remain bedrock philosophical disagreements, not fixable flaws:
- **Eliminative materialists** will deny consciousness exists as a causal agent—this is the dualism debate itself
- **MWI proponents** will dissolve locality via branching—the Map rejects MWI per Tenet 4
- **Empiricists** will demand testable predictions—this article provides conceptual clarification, not empirical proposal
- **Quantum skeptics** will note the gap between entanglement and consciousness-causation—the article now explicitly acknowledges this gap rather than glossing over it

Future reviews should NOT re-flag these as critical issues. The article should be considered stable unless new content is added.
