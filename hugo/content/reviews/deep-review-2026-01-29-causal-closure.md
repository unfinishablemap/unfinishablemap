# Deep Review: Causal Closure of the Physical

**Date**: 2026-01-29
**File**: obsidian/concepts/causal-closure.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-22
**Cross-review context**: delegatory-dualism.md insights

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The previous review (2026-01-22) resolved major issues including:
- Hidden variable theories (Bohmian mechanics)
- Homunculus fallacy in "selection" concept
- Overdetermination objection
- Decoherence challenge
- Testability criteria

### Medium Issues Found and Addressed

1. **Missing connection to delegatory dualism** (identified from cross-review context): The article discussed "complementary determination" but didn't reference Bradford Saad's 2025 delegatory dualism framework, which provides a more rigorous treatment of avoiding overdetermination through preemption rather than complementary causation.
   - **Resolution**: Added paragraph explaining Saad's delegation mechanism and how it relates to the Map's quantum framework. The two approaches may be complementary—quantum indeterminacy as substrate, delegation as causal structure.

2. **Missing concept link**: The concepts list didn't include `[delegatory-dualism](/topics/delegatory-dualism/)`.
   - **Resolution**: Added to frontmatter concepts list.

### Low Issues

- Buddhist/Eastern perspectives on mind-causation not engaged—acceptable for a concept page focused on Western causal closure debate.

### Counterarguments Considered

- Saad's preemption-based framework vs the Map's complementary determination framework were integrated as compatible approaches rather than competitors.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- **Front-loaded structure**: Opening paragraph states thesis, stakes, and Map's position clearly
- **Formulation dilemma** (Kim's too-strong/too-weak problem): Genuine philosophical vulnerability in causal closure
- **Chess analogy**: Effective illustration of complementary determination
- **Consciousness reporting argument**: Forces physicalists into difficult dilemma
- **Three-part decoherence response**: Timescale disputes, measurement problem persistence, quantum Zeno maintenance
- **Testability section**: Four explicit falsification criteria

### Enhancements Made

1. **Delegatory dualism integration**: Added substantive connection to Saad's 2025 framework in the overdetermination response section, explaining preemption mechanism and how it complements quantum interactionism.

2. **Further Reading expansion**: Added `[delegatory-dualism](/topics/delegatory-dualism/)` entry with brief description.

### Cross-links Added

- `[delegatory-dualism](/topics/delegatory-dualism/)` in overdetermination response section
- `[delegatory-dualism](/topics/delegatory-dualism/)` in Further Reading

### Condensations Applied (Length-Neutral Mode)

Article exceeded hard threshold (3650 words vs 3500 limit). Applied condensations:

1. **Statistical response section**: Reduced from ~180 words to ~60 words—removed verbose explanation of thermalization events and specific numbers while preserving core argument.

2. **Emergentist response section**: Reduced from ~200 words to ~100 words—consolidated O'Connor and Wong summary, removed extended quotation, preserved key insight that quantum framework provides mechanism for emergent causation.

**Net result**: 3650 → 3419 words (231 words reduced, now below hard threshold)

## Remaining Items

None. The article is comprehensive and addresses the major objections to causal closure rejection. The cross-review integration with delegatory dualism strengthens the overdetermination response without adding speculative mechanism commitments.

## Stability Notes

This article has reached good stability after three reviews (2026-01-20, 2026-01-22, 2026-01-29). Key philosophical disagreements are acknowledged as bedrock:

- **Materialist persona objections**: The article presents dualist responses; materialists will remain unconvinced. This is expected philosophical standoff, not a flaw.
- **Quantum skeptic concerns**: Decoherence timescales remain empirically uncertain. The article acknowledges this honestly rather than overclaiming.
- **MWI defender objections**: The article notes that rejecting MWI (Tenet 4) does crucial work. MWI proponents won't accept this, but the Map's position is internally coherent.

Future reviews should NOT re-flag these as critical issues unless new content reintroduces problems the article already addresses.
