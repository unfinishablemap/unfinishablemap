title: Deep Review - Idealism
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-20
**Article**: [Idealism](/concepts/idealism/)
**Previous review**: [2026-02-05](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-05-idealism/)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article is factually accurate, internally consistent, and properly attributed. All six adversarial personas applied; no critical issues identified.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Opening paragraph density**: The original opening (108 words) packed definition, Kastrup's specific version, and the Map's position into one paragraph. Restructured into two paragraphs for better truncation resilience — the Map's distinctive position now appears in the first paragraph.

### Low Issues Found
- Minor wordiness in several passages (dissociation model explanation, multiple observer section). Tightened prose throughout.

### Counterarguments Considered

All six adversarial personas applied. No new issues beyond previously identified bedrock disagreements:

- **Eliminative Materialist (Churchland)**: Rejects the hard problem premise. This is the Map's tenet-level starting point — not arguable within this article.
- **Hard-Nosed Physicalist (Dennett)**: Phenomenology of otherness is interpretable either way. Article already acknowledges this explicitly ("wager, not a proof").
- **Quantum Skeptic (Tegmark)**: Quantum mechanism qualified as speculative with pointer to fuller treatment.
- **Many-Worlds Defender (Deutsch)**: Indexical argument remains unsatisfying to MWI proponents. Bedrock disagreement.
- **Empiricist (Popper)**: No issues — article acknowledges positions are wagers, not proofs.
- **Buddhist Philosopher (Nagarjuna)**: Madhyamaka complications acknowledged in "The Idealist Vision" section with link to compatibility thesis.

### Attribution Accuracy Check

Verified against source articles and research notes:
- Kastrup claims (dissociation model, parsimony argument, DID analogy): **Accurate**
- Berkeley (*esse est percipi*, God's perception): **Accurate**
- Sartre (pour-soi/en-soi, resistance, indifference): **Accurate** — framed as interpretation, not direct quote
- Filter theory neutrality between dualism and idealism: **Accurate**
- Witness consciousness dual interpretation: **Accurate**
- Phenomenal value realism indexical identity connection: **Accurate**
- No dropped qualifiers, no source/Map conflation, no misattributions found.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Fair treatment of idealism's genuine advantages (parsimony, dissolving hard problem)
- Honest acknowledgment of slime mold challenge for the Map's framework
- The phenomenological argument for otherness (strongest original contribution)
- "Wager, not a proof" epistemic humility throughout
- Strong cross-linking (15+ internal wikilinks, all verified)
- The closing "If forced to choose" paragraph — positions the Map with intellectual honesty
- Parallel structure in "Idealism's answer" / "The Map's answer" sections

### Enhancements Made

1. **Restructured opening** — Split dense first paragraph to front-load the Map's distinctive position for better LLM truncation resilience
2. **Tightened prose** — Removed redundant phrases in dissociation model section, multiple observer section, and opening paragraph (~29 words trimmed)
3. **Updated metadata** — Set `last_deep_review` timestamp (was null despite previous reviews, likely reset by coalesce operation)

### Cross-links Verified
All wikilinks verified as existing articles (including `[interface-locality](/concepts/brain-interface-boundary/)` which exists in archive with preserved URL).

## Remaining Items

None. The article has been stable across multiple reviews and the coalesce integration was well-executed.

## Stability Notes

This is the fourth deep review of this article. The article reached stability at the second review (2026-01-30) and was subsequently modified by a coalesce operation (2026-02-15) that merged analytic-idealism.md into it. This review confirms the coalesced content integrates well and introduces no new issues.

Key philosophical disagreements (unchanged across all reviews):
- **Eliminativists** will reject the hard problem premise — this is the Map's tenet-level starting point
- **MWI defenders** will find the indexical argument unsatisfying — this reflects the No Many Worlds tenet
- **Quantum skeptics** have legitimate decoherence concerns — acknowledged with pointer to fuller treatment

Future reviews should not re-flag these as critical issues. The article is at convergence.

**Word count**: 2837 → 2808 (-29 words) — operating in length-neutral mode (112% of 2500 soft threshold)
