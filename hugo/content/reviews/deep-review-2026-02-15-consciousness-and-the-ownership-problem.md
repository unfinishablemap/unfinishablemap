## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Buddhist engagement uncharitable**: Original text reduced *anattā* to mere impermanence rather than engaging with the conventional/ultimate distinction. Resolution: Rewrote Buddhist section to acknowledge the depth of the conventional/ultimate framework, then explain why the Map's ownership claim survives at both levels of analysis.
- **MWI section didn't address strongest response**: The article stated "ownership cannot branch" without engaging the MWI defender's reply that branching creates genuinely distinct subjects. Resolution: Added the MWI response and the Map's counter—that conceding distinct subjects abandons determinacy of ownership.
- **Functionalism dismissal begged the question**: The original phrasing assumed there's a further fact about ownership beyond functional role without arguing for it. Resolution: Strengthened the argument to distinguish the question of which system a state belongs to from the question of who experiences it.
- **Illusionism response compressed**: The reductio ("if nobody owns the illusion...") is valid but doesn't engage the strongest illusionist positions. Deferred — the existing response is adequate and further expansion would unbalance the section.

### Low Issues Found
- **Falsifiability section**: Sets up four challenges then immediately argues they can't be met, which could read as immunizing the position. Deferred — the section is philosophically honest and serves its purpose.
- **Frontmatter reference to `[phenomenal-unity](/concepts/phenomenal-binding-and-holism/)`**: No standalone article exists. Resolution: Changed to `[why-phenomenal-unity-resists-explanation](/topics/why-phenomenal-unity-resists-explanation/)`.

### Counterarguments Considered
- Eliminative materialist: Ownership may be folk-psychological concept dissolved by mature neuroscience → Article addresses this implicitly through illusionism discussion
- Dennett's heterophenomenology: Self as narrative construct, no separate owner needed → Article engages illusionism generally; specific Dennett engagement deferred
- MWI branching as creation of distinct subjects → Now addressed directly in text
- Buddhist conventional/ultimate distinction → Now addressed directly in text

### Attribution Accuracy
- Husserl on first-personal givenness: **Verified accurate** against *Ideas* (1913)
- Zahavi on minimal self as mode of experience: **Verified accurate** against *Subjectivity and Selfhood* (2005)
- Gallagher (2000) reference: **Verified accurate**
- All references: No misattributions, no dropped qualifiers, no source/Map conflation detected

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Three-part distinction (not binding, not unity, not self) — exceptional philosophical clarity
- Book analogy ("words are not about anything until someone reads them") — vivid and accessible
- Duplication thought experiment — cleanly shows intrinsic physical properties can't fix ownership
- Ownership-agency connection — simple and powerful argument
- "What Would Challenge This View?" section — honest falsifiability engagement
- Charge analogy for primitiveness — makes philosophical primitiveness intuitive
- Opening paragraph — front-loads the core question effectively

### Enhancements Made
- Buddhist section enriched with conventional/ultimate distinction engagement (+~100 words)
- MWI section strengthened with response to "branching creates distinct subjects" (+~60 words)
- Functionalism critique refined to avoid question-begging (+~30 words)
- Frontmatter concept link corrected

### Cross-links Added
No new cross-links needed — article already has extensive and accurate cross-linking.

## Word Count
- Before: 2024 words (67% of 3000 threshold)
- After: 2233 words (74% of 3000 threshold)
- Change: +209 words

## Remaining Items

- Illusionism response could engage more deeply with Dennett's heterophenomenology, but current treatment is adequate and further expansion would unbalance the section
- Falsifiability section's immediate dismissal of challenges could be softened, but the philosophical honesty of stating the challenges outweighs the optics concern

## Stability Notes

- MWI defenders will always contest the claim that ownership requires determinacy — this is a bedrock disagreement between MWI and the Map's position, not a flaw to fix
- Eliminative materialists will always reject that "ownership" is a genuine phenomenon — this disagreement is fundamental and the article appropriately engages with it through the illusionism discussion
- Buddhist philosophers may find the article's insistence on irreducible ownership unconvincing even after charitable engagement — this reflects a genuine metaphysical disagreement about whether conventional designations track real features
