# Deep Review: Neural Correlates of Consciousness

**Date**: 2026-01-21
**File**: obsidian/concepts/neural-correlates-of-consciousness.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Missing illusionist engagement**: The article presented NCC as philosophically neutral without addressing the strongest physicalist interpretation—that NCCs reveal consciousness *is* neural activity. **Resolution**: Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section with the regress response and analysis of NCC neutrality.
- **Missing falsifiability section**: No "What Would Challenge This View?" section to specify conditions that would undermine the interactionist interpretation. **Resolution**: Added comprehensive section with 5 falsifiable conditions.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Thin tenet connections**: "Relation to Site Perspective" section covered only 4 tenets briefly without substantive analysis. **Resolution**: Expanded to all 5 tenets with detailed connections, including the explanatory gap argument for Dualism and the indexical identity problem for No Many Worlds.
- **Missing process philosophy perspective**: No engagement with Whitehead's framework for understanding NCC findings. **Resolution**: Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section covering actual occasions, why NCCs are correlations not identities, and concrescence/neural integration.
- **Missing contemplative evidence**: No discussion of witness consciousness and what it reveals about the limits of NCC methodology. **Resolution**: Added "Contemplative Evidence and NCC" section covering the observer problem and what contemplatives report.

### Low Issues Found
- **Quantum mechanism reference lacked decoherence acknowledgment**: The interface question section mentioned quantum mechanisms without noting the standard objection. **Resolution**: Added decoherence challenge reference in Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet section.
- **No cross-link to explanatory-gap.md**: Central concept for the article not linked. **Resolution**: Added wikilink and explanatory text.

### Counterarguments Considered
- Illusionist argument that NCC research supports physicalism → addressed via regress response and noting NCC neutrality
- Materialist claim that the explanatory gap will close with more neural data → addressed in Dualism tenet section noting gap's persistence

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Strong opening paragraph front-loading key claims (truncation-resilient)
- Memory systems section providing unique Map contribution (extending NCC to different consciousness modes)
- Filter theory interpretation with supporting evidence (covert consciousness, disconnection syndromes)
- COGITATE experiment coverage with balanced assessment
- Clear "Correlation Is Not Identity" argument

### Enhancements Made
1. Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section with regress response and neutrality analysis
2. Added "Contemplative Evidence and NCC" section connecting to witness consciousness tradition
3. Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section (Whitehead's actual occasions, concrescence)
4. Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section with 5 falsifiable conditions
5. Substantially expanded "Relation to Site Perspective" covering all 5 tenets with substantive analysis
6. Enhanced references section

### Cross-links Added
- [illusionism](/concepts/illusionism/) — radical physicalist challenge
- [introspection](/concepts/introspection/) — first-person access to phenomenal content
- [witness-consciousness](/concepts/witness-consciousness/) — observer phenomenon
- [decoherence](/concepts/decoherence/) — quantum coherence objection
- [haecceity](/concepts/haecceity/) — indexical identity
- [explanatory-gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/) — conceptual chasm NCC cannot bridge

## Remaining Items

None. All critical and medium issues addressed. The article now provides comprehensive coverage of NCC research with full engagement with counterarguments and explicit connections to all five tenets.
