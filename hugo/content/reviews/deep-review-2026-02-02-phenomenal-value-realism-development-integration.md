title: Deep Review - Developing Phenomenal Value Realism (Integration)
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Article**: [Developing Phenomenal Value Realism](/archive/topics/phenomenal-value-realism-development/)
**Previous review**: [2026-02-02](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-02-phenomenal-value-realism-development/) (same day, earlier)
**Focus**: Orphan integration—adding inbound cross-links from related articles

## Context

This article was flagged as orphaned (no inbound links). The earlier review today found no critical issues and confirmed the article's content quality. This follow-up review focused specifically on integrating the article into the site's navigation by adding cross-links from related articles.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article content was reviewed earlier today with no critical issues identified.

### Medium Issues Found
None new. The earlier review addressed all medium issues.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
All strengths identified in earlier review remain intact.

### Cross-links Added

The following articles now link to [phenomenal-value-realism-development](/archive/topics/phenomenal-value-realism-development/):

1. **[phenomenal-value-realism](/concepts/phenomenal-value-realism/)** (concept article)
   - Added to Further Reading section
   - Context: "Developing the metaethical foundations: how the view addresses queerness objections, the is-ought gap, and extends to phenomenal value pluralism"

2. **[ethics-of-consciousness](/topics/ethics-of-consciousness/)** (topics)
   - Added to Further Reading section
   - Context: "How phenomenal value pluralism extends beyond hedonism to address metaethical challenges"

3. **[meaning-of-life](/topics/meaning-of-life/)** (topics)
   - Added to Further Reading Core Concepts subsection
   - Context: "Extending phenomenal value realism to address metaethical challenges and value pluralism"

4. **[consciousness-value-connection](/concepts/consciousness-value-connection/)** (concepts)
   - Added to Further Reading section
   - Context: "How consciousness-grounded value addresses metaethical challenges and extends to pluralism"

5. **[living-with-the-map](/apex/living-with-the-map/)** (apex)
   - Added to Source Articles section
   - Context: "How value pluralism extends beyond hedonism"

6. **[purpose-and-alignment](/topics/purpose-and-alignment/)** (topics)
   - Added to Further Reading section
   - Context: "How phenomenal value pluralism addresses the measurement problem and metaethical challenges"

### Rationale for Link Placement

Each cross-link was placed in the appropriate section (typically Further Reading) with a description that explains why readers of that article would benefit from the development article:

- The concept article (**phenomenal-value-realism**) now links to its development article first, since the development article explicitly addresses challenges the concept article introduces but does not resolve
- **ethics-of-consciousness** and **meaning-of-life** both discuss value grounded in consciousness and benefit from the metaethical development
- **consciousness-value-connection** directly builds on the same foundation and benefits from the expanded metaethical analysis
- **living-with-the-map** synthesizes material from phenomenal value realism and should include the development article as a source
- **purpose-and-alignment** discusses the measurement problem, which the development article addresses

## Remaining Items

None. The article is now integrated into the site navigation with 6 inbound links from highly relevant articles.

## Stability Notes

The article reached stability in the earlier same-day review. The philosophical disagreements noted there (Buddhist emptiness critique, functionalist objections, MWI value problem) remain bedrock disagreements and should not be re-flagged in future reviews.

## Word Count

No changes to target article. Cross-link additions to other articles: minimal (1 line each).
