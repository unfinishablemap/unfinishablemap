**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Svasaṃvedana presented as uncontested Buddhist doctrine**: The article treated *svasaṃvedana* as representative of "Buddhist phenomenology" without noting its rejection by the Madhyamaka school (Nāgārjuna's lineage, Candrakīrti) and the Gelukpa tradition. **Resolution**: Added a paragraph noting the intra-Buddhist controversy, distinguishing the Yogācāra-epistemological tradition from Madhyamaka's rejection, and connecting this to the parallel Western debate.

2. **"Irreducibly circular structure" attribution unclear**: The phrase was presented as though it came from Coseru, but could not be verified as his wording. **Resolution**: Rephrased to remove the direct-quotation framing, describing the structure as "reflexive, circular" in the article author's own voice rather than attributing the exact phrase.

3. **Missing author in Religious Studies citation**: The 2023 Cambridge article on Sāṃkhya and the hard problem lacked its author's name (Karen O'Brien-Kop). **Resolution**: Added the author name in both the in-text reference and the References section.

### Medium Issues Found

- **No Many Worlds tenet paragraph drew from irrelevant domains**: Buddhist "present moment" emphasis is soteriological, not about quantum branching; Yoruba *ori-inu* concerns personal destiny, not quantum mechanics. **Resolution**: Rewrote the paragraph to acknowledge the connection is thematic rather than direct, focusing on the more defensible parallels (Nyāya's unified subject, Buddhist emphasis on singular experiential stream).

- **"Uniformly" overstated non-Western rejection of branching ontologies**: Some Buddhist concepts (karma seeds, alaya-vijnana) have structural similarities to branching. **Resolution**: Removed "uniformly" from the rewritten paragraph.

- **Tempels' colonial provenance missing**: Bantu philosophy section cited Tempels' framework without noting it has been challenged as a colonial projection. **Resolution**: Added parenthetical noting Césaire and Fanon's critique.

- **Occam's Razor paragraph treated contemplative depth as evidence for ontological claims without qualification**: Contemplative traditions may generate valuable phenomenological data without their metaphysical conclusions necessarily following. **Resolution**: Qualified the paragraph to distinguish phenomenological data from ontological conclusions.

- **Peter Adamson quotation source not in References**: **Resolution**: Added Adamson (2016) Aeon article to References.

- **Process-philosophy in frontmatter but no connection in text**: **Resolution**: Added inline cross-link to [process-philosophy](/concepts/process-philosophy/) in the Buddhist section and to Further Reading.

- **Missing cross-links to existing Map articles**: Agent-causation, filter-theory, cross-cultural-phenomenology-of-agency, and process-philosophy were all relevant and existed on the Map. **Resolution**: Added inline and Further Reading cross-links.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Convergence argument groups incompatible claims** (Eliminative Materialist): The article already acknowledges this in "What Would Challenge This View?" point (2). The convergence table operates at a high level of abstraction—this is acknowledged as a limitation rather than hidden.

- **Sattva-reflection is redescriptive, not explanatory** (Dennett): Valid concern. The article now links to [filter-theory](/concepts/filter-theory/) to make clear this is a framework rather than an explanation.

- **Contemplative depth doesn't correlate with ontological accuracy** (Dennett): Addressed by qualifying the Occam's Razor paragraph to focus on phenomenological data rather than metaphysical conclusions.

- **Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet connection lacks substance** (Quantum Skeptic): The article already acknowledges "the underlying structures differ substantially." The honest qualification is a strength, not a weakness—no changes needed beyond what exists.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- **The convergence table** — Clean, scannable summary that all six sympathetic personas found valuable
- **The honest Chinese counter-example** — Extended engagement with framework-dependence challenge; intellectual integrity all personas endorsed
- **"What Would Challenge This View?" section** — Five distinct counterarguments model philosophical rigor
- **Nishida's direct quotation** — The strongest phenomenological moment in the article
- **Tradition-first vocabulary** — Each section uses the tradition's own terms before translating to Western vocabulary

### Enhancements Made

- Added intra-Buddhist debate on *svasaṃvedana* (Madhyamaka rejection) — enriches the Buddhist section with genuine philosophical complexity
- Added [process-philosophy](/concepts/process-philosophy/) cross-link in Buddhist section — makes the Buddhism-Whitehead connection explicit
- Added [agent-causation](/concepts/agent-causation/) cross-link in Nyāya section — strengthens the interactionist framework
- Added [filter-theory](/concepts/filter-theory/) cross-link in Sāṃkhya section — connects reflection model to existing Map concept
- Added four new entries to Further Reading: agent-causation, filter-theory, process-philosophy, cross-cultural-phenomenology-of-agency

### Cross-links Added

- [process-philosophy](/concepts/process-philosophy/) — Buddhist momentariness section
- [agent-causation](/concepts/agent-causation/) — Nyāya section (inline and Further Reading)
- [filter-theory](/concepts/filter-theory/) — Sāṃkhya section (inline and Further Reading)
- [cross-cultural-phenomenology-of-agency](/topics/cross-cultural-phenomenology-of-agency/) — Further Reading

## Remaining Items

### Deferred to Future Work

- **Advaita Vedānta dedicated section**: The convergence table includes Advaita but the article has no standalone section. The research notes contain extensive material. Adding a section would push toward the word limit; this is better addressed if a future review finds the article still below threshold after other changes.

- **Al-Ghazālī expanded treatment**: Currently mentioned only in Further Reading. The research notes document his mysterianism at length. A brief paragraph after the Avicenna section would strengthen the Islamic coverage but would require word budget.

- **Buddhist *avyākata* (unanswered questions)**: The Buddha's refusal to answer certain metaphysical questions parallels mysterianism. Not currently mentioned. Could be added to the Buddhist section.

- **Udayana secondary source citation**: The Udayana argument lacks a specific secondary source in the text. The research notes trace it to IEP/SEP articles but the article doesn't specify which. A future review should add the specific source.

- **Ori-inu source identification**: The quotation comes from an informal textbook (Pressbooks). The article would benefit from identifying the modern interpreter or finding a more scholarly source.

## Stability Notes

- **The Chinese counter-example is a bedrock philosophical disagreement**, not a flaw to fix. Chinese holism may genuinely dissolve the hard problem rather than evading it. The article's honest engagement with this is a strength. Future reviews should NOT try to "resolve" this—it represents a genuine limit of the convergence argument.

- **The Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet connection will always be the weakest** of the five tenet mappings, because non-Western traditions predate quantum mechanics. The current honest qualification ("thematic concern," "structures differ substantially") is the correct calibration. Future reviews should not try to strengthen this beyond what the evidence supports.

- **The convergence argument requires a high level of abstraction** that will always be vulnerable to the Empiricist objection that grouping diverse traditions under "convergence on irreducibility" abstracts away too much. The article acknowledges this. Future reviews should not try to definitively answer this objection—it is a genuine methodological tension.

- **The Madhyamaka rejection of svasaṃvedana** is now noted. Future reviews should NOT escalate this into questioning whether the Buddhist section "supports the Map" — the article correctly identifies that *where* svasaṃvedana is accepted, it supports the irreducibility claim. The intra-Buddhist debate is documented, not papered over.
