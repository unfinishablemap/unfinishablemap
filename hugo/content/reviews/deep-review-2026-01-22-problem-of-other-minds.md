# Deep Review: Problem of Other Minds

**Date**: 2026-01-22
**File**: obsidian/concepts/problem-of-other-minds.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-18

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
1. **Missing illusionist engagement**: The article discussed various solutions to the problem of other minds but didn't engage with illusionism—a major position that claims to dissolve the problem entirely.
   - **Resolution**: Added comprehensive "The Illusionist Challenge" section (~500 words) addressing Frankish's quasi-phenomenal response, the regress at the meta-level, the discourse evidence, the specificity problem, and contemplative counter-evidence.

2. **Missing falsifiability section**: No "What Would Challenge This View?" section, making the position unfalsifiable.
   - **Resolution**: Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section (~350 words) with five specific conditions that would undermine the analysis.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Missing Process Philosophy perspective**: Standard section for deep articles was absent.
   - **Resolution**: Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section (~350 words) covering Whitehead's actual occasions, prehension, and how this reframes the problem.

2. **Missing Buddhist contemplative perspective**: No engagement with contemplative traditions despite site pattern.
   - **Resolution**: Added "Buddhist Contemplative Perspective" section (~400 words) covering anattā, vijñāna, Madhyamaka śūnyatā, karuṇā practices, and tonglen.

3. **Thin/absent No Many Worlds argument**: The Relation to Site Perspective section didn't connect to the No Many Worlds tenet.
   - **Resolution**: Added substantial No Many Worlds argument (~250 words) explaining how MWI problematizes the determinacy the problem presupposes, connecting to haecceity and indexical identity.

4. **Missing cross-links to consciousness-as-amplifier**: The recent article on consciousness as amplifier provides evidence for consciousness attribution in animals that wasn't referenced.
   - **Resolution**: Added integration paragraph in the Extensions section connecting great ape evidence to consciousness attribution grounds.

### Counterarguments Considered
- Illusionist claim that the asymmetry dissolves if phenomenal consciousness is illusory
- Dennett's heterophenomenology as dissolution
- MWI defenders' response that branch-indexicality preserves the question
- Buddhist non-self as undermining the self/other distinction

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- The "Argument from Discourse" section—genuinely novel contribution to the literature
- Opening paragraph's vivid, direct, philosophically precise framing
- The Dualist's Dilemma section's clear tenet connection
- Overall structure aiding navigation
- Treatment of animals/machines extension

### Enhancements Made
1. Illusionist engagement with detailed response to Frankish's quasi-phenomenal framework
2. Process Philosophy perspective section following Whitehead's actual occasions
3. Buddhist contemplative perspective with technical terminology (anattā, vijñāna, śūnya, karuṇā, tonglen)
4. Comprehensive falsifiability conditions
5. No Many Worlds argument connecting to haecceity
6. Integration with consciousness-as-amplifier evidence
7. Strengthened cross-links throughout
