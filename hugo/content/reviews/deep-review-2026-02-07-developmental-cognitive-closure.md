title: Deep Review - The Developmental Void
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Article**: [The Developmental Void](/voids/developmental-cognitive-closure/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **"Mice" → "rats"**: The landmark perineuronal net enzyme study (Pizzorusso et al., 2002) used rats, not mice. **Fixed**: corrected species and added citation.
- **Simner et al. (2009) → (2006)**: Citation date was wrong — volume 35 of *Perception* corresponds to 2006. **Fixed**: corrected year in References.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Neonatal synesthesia overstated**: "Evidence suggests all neonates may experience stimuli synesthetically" was too confident for a contested hypothesis. **Fixed**: reframed as "neonatal synesthesia hypothesis" with attribution to Maurer & Mondloch (2005), added note that Deroy & Spence (2013) contest it.
- **"Up to 40% of excitatory synapses"**: The specific figure appears to be an underestimate; Petanjek et al. (2011) found spine density reductions of 50% or more. **Fixed**: replaced specific figure with reference to Petanjek's findings.
- **No Many Worlds tenet connection was stretched**: Conflated diachronic personal identity with MWI's branching identity. **Fixed**: rewrote to focus on the one-way, singular nature of closure — under collapse interpretations, the lost territory is genuinely gone rather than preserved in parallel branches.
- **"Actively chosen (if not consciously)"**: The parenthetical undermined the main clause. **Fixed**: reframed expertise limits as "not consciously chosen but emergent from practice" in the taxonomy section; added a sentence in the expert's closure section noting the similarity to biologically mandated closure.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Churchland/eliminative materialist**: Infant perceptual breadth is undifferentiation, not "territory." The article's framing as "loss" presupposes dualism. *Response*: This is the article's thesis operating within the Map's framework — the framing is intentional, and the article does acknowledge that closure "serves purposes" and improves efficiency.
- **Dennett/functionalist**: "Phenomenology of loss" trades on Cartesian Theater imagery. *Response*: The "absence rather than presence" characterisation actually aligns with Dennett's critique — there is no inner screen narrowing. The loss is structural, not phenomenal. The section already handles this well.
- **Nagarjuna/Buddhist**: The three-part taxonomy presupposes stable self with varying access. *Response*: A valid philosophical concern but one the article need not resolve — it operates within the Map's framework which does presuppose a subject of experience.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening paragraph's narrative inversion ("voids we acquired rather than inherited") — the article's strongest conceptual move
- "Absence rather than presence" phenomenological characterisation of developmental loss
- The three-part taxonomy (architectural/developmental/expertise limits)
- Gopnik's explore-exploit framing, appropriately attributed
- Clean separation between neuroscience evidence and Map interpretation in Relation to Site Perspective
- Well-structured progression from evidence → mechanism → classification → implications

### Enhancements Made
- Strengthened neonatal synesthesia section with proper attribution and contestation
- Corrected synaptic pruning statistics with Petanjek citation
- Improved No Many Worlds tenet connection to focus on collapse vs. branching
- Clarified expertise limits as emergent rather than chosen
- Added 4 new references (Petanjek 2011, Pizzorusso 2002, Maurer & Mondloch 2005, Deroy & Spence 2013)

### Cross-links Added
None new (existing cross-links are comprehensive). The following related articles could benefit from linking *to* this article:
- [three-kinds-of-void](/voids/three-kinds-of-void/) — developmental closure as example of acquired occlusion
- [convergent-cognitive-limits](/voids/convergent-cognitive-limits/) — developmental closure compounds across cultures similarly
- [embodiment-cognitive-limits](/voids/embodiment-cognitive-limits/) — embodiment changes during development
- [phenomenology-of-the-edge](/voids/phenomenology-of-the-edge/) — "absence rather than presence" contrasts with edge-clarity
- [mysterianism](/concepts/mysterianism/) — developmental closure as empirical evidence for cognitive closure thesis

## Remaining Items

None — all critical and medium issues addressed.

## Stability Notes

- The eliminative materialist objection (infant breadth as undifferentiation, not lost territory) represents a bedrock philosophical disagreement. The article intentionally frames developmental changes as "closure" from a dualist perspective. Future reviews should not re-flag this framing as problematic.
- The Dennett-style objection to "phenomenology of loss" is largely addressed by the article's own "absence rather than presence" characterisation. No further changes needed.
