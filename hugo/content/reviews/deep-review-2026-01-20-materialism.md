**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Illusionism section too dismissive**: The original treatment didn't engage seriously with Dennett's heterophenomenological method or the sophisticated version of the position. Resolution: Expanded section with Dennett's actual methodology and added the regress objection with explicit argument structure.
- **Missing falsifiability section**: The article presented The Unfinishable Map's position without acknowledging what evidence could count against it. Resolution: Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section with five specific falsification conditions.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing No Many Worlds tenet connection**: The Relation to Site Perspective section covered only four of five tenets. Resolution: Added explicit discussion of how MWI relates to materialism and why it doesn't rescue physicalism from the hard problem.
- **No mysterianism engagement**: The article mentioned "future science" response but didn't connect to McGinn's cognitive closure hypothesis. Resolution: Added The Mysterian Alternative section.
- **Missing process philosophy perspective**: The article framed the debate as strictly materialism vs dualism, missing alternative frameworks. Resolution: Added Process Philosophy Perspective section with Whitehead's actual occasions.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Dennett's heterophenomenology**: Addressed by presenting the method fairly before offering the regress objection.
- **MWI eliminates need for consciousness at collapse**: Addressed by showing the indexical problem merely relocates rather than solves the hard problem.
- **Cognitive closure alternative**: Presented McGinn's view as deserving serious consideration while explaining why the Map takes the explanatory gap as evidence against materialism rather than as cognitive limitation.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear presentation of materialist varieties (reductive, non-reductive, eliminative, illusionist)
- Strong section on the causal closure argument
- Good engagement with idealism as alternative
- Well-written opening summary with appropriate confidence
