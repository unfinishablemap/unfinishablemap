# Deep Review: Embodied Cognition and the Extended Mind

**Date**: 2026-01-22
**File**: obsidian/concepts/embodied-cognition.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-20

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The previous review (2026-01-20) addressed major gaps including illusionism engagement, falsifiability section, and process philosophy.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Missing consciousness-as-amplifier integration**: The article was written before the consciousness-as-amplifier.md article (2026-01-21) which provides directly relevant content about how consciousness interfaces with procedural systems.
   - **Resolution**: Added "The Amplification Connection" subsection (~300 words) explaining how the amplification hypothesis illuminates the Dreyfus progression and choking phenomenon.

2. **Missing Buddhist contemplative phenomenology**: Other site articles have added Buddhist phenomenological analysis for consistency and depth; this article lacked comparable treatment despite having a Process Philosophy section.
   - **Resolution**: Added "Buddhist Phenomenology of Embodied Skill" section (~400 words) covering nāmarūpa, jhāna progression parallels, kāyagatāsati, and Zen mushin.

3. **Quantum mechanism lacked timescale caveat**: The connection between attention modes and quantum Zeno effect was stated without acknowledging timescale challenges (standard site practice in recent reviews).
   - **Resolution**: Added qualification paragraph (~100 words) noting the speculative nature and that the phenomenological mapping holds regardless of underlying mechanism.

### Low Issues Found
1. **Illusionism section could acknowledge eliminativist claim more directly**: The response to Dennett didn't fully address the eliminativist move of rejecting phenomenological categories entirely.
   - **Resolution**: Added paragraph (~100 words) addressing the eliminativist claim and why predictive success of phenomenological vocabulary suggests these categories track something real.

2. **MWI section lacked self-locating uncertainty acknowledgment**: Standard MWI defense wasn't explicitly addressed.
   - **Resolution**: Added paragraph (~100 words) engaging with self-locating uncertainty and explaining why training effects undermine this interpretation.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminativist rejection of phenomenological categories**: Addressed by noting predictive success of absorbed/self-monitoring distinction
- **MWI self-locating uncertainty**: Addressed by noting training effects require selection-like dynamics
- **Timescale objection to quantum mechanisms**: Acknowledged as a genuine challenge while noting cumulative Zeno effects and mechanism-independence of phenomenological mapping

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent framing of embodied cognition vs property dualism compatibility
- Compelling choking evidence for bidirectional interaction
- Clear Dreyfus progression table with consciousness modes
- Strong Process Philosophy section connecting Whitehead to Merleau-Ponty
- Good falsifiability section with five testable conditions
- Well-developed filter theory compatibility discussion

### Enhancements Made
1. Added consciousness-as-amplifier integration (~300 words) explaining inappropriate amplification in choking
2. Added Buddhist phenomenology section (~400 words) with technical vocabulary (nāmarūpa, jhāna, kāyagatāsati, mushin)
3. Added timescale caveat to quantum mechanism claims (~100 words)
4. Strengthened illusionism response with eliminativist engagement (~100 words)
5. Strengthened No Many Worlds argument with self-locating uncertainty response (~100 words)
6. Added phenomenology-of-choice cross-link connecting absorbed/effortful distinction

### Cross-links Added
Frontmatter concepts:
- [consciousness-as-amplifier](/concepts/consciousness-as-amplifier/)
- [phenomenology-of-choice](/concepts/phenomenology-of-choice/)

Further Reading additions:
- [consciousness-as-amplifier](/concepts/consciousness-as-amplifier/) — moved to top with description
- [phenomenology-of-choice](/concepts/phenomenology-of-choice/) — added second with description

## Remaining Items

None. All medium and low priority issues addressed.
