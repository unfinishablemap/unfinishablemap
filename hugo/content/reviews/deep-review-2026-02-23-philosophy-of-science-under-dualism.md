**Date**: 2026-02-23
**Article**: [Philosophy of Science Under Dualism](/concepts/philosophy-of-science-under-dualism/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Broken reference to coalesced article**: Frontmatter `topics` and Further Reading referenced `consciousness-and-the-philosophy-of-explanation`, which was coalesced into `consciousness-and-the-limits-of-explanation`. Updated both locations.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Slight strawman in epistemological asymmetry section**: Original text ("Dismissing consciousness as unreal or reducible while accepting electrons as real inverts the epistemic order") risked mischaracterizing the physicalist position. Physicalists don't deny consciousness exists — they deny its ontological independence. Replaced with a more precise two-paragraph treatment that acknowledges the physicalist position before pressing the epistemic asymmetry argument.
- **Fodor cited but not engaged**: Fodor (1974) appeared in References but was never discussed in the text. Added a paragraph in the Unity of Science section connecting Fodor's argument about special sciences to the dualist position — dualism strengthens Fodor's point from practical failure (multiple realizability) to ontological failure.
- **Lakatosian assessment one-sided**: The claim that the materialist programme is "theoretically degenerating" needed to acknowledge the physicalist response (IIT, GWT as genuine progress). Added a paragraph presenting this counterargument and the dualist rejoinder (progress on easy problems vs. hard problem).
- **Missing cross-link**: `consciousness-and-the-problem-of-theoretical-virtues` directly overlaps with the theory choice and parsimony section. Added inline link and to frontmatter/Further Reading.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Physicalist response on scientific realism**: Physicalists don't deny consciousness — they dispute its characterization. Addressed by reframing the asymmetry argument.
- **Physicalist response on research programmes**: IIT and GWT as theoretical progress, not stagnation. Addressed by distinguishing progress on easy vs. hard problems.
- **Eliminativist challenge**: The concept "consciousness" may itself need revision. Not addressed directly — this is a bedrock disagreement with the Map's tenets.

## Attribution Accuracy Check

This is a synthesis article, not source-based. Checked all specific claims:
- Kuhn (1962) on non-algorithmic theory choice: correctly represented
- Lakatos (1978) progressive/degenerating distinction: correctly represented
- Popper (1959) on falsifiability: correctly represented
- Fodor (1974) on special sciences: correctly represented (after adding engagement)
- Oppenheim & Putnam (1958) on unity of science: correctly represented
- Chalmers (1996): correctly used as reference for the hard problem
- No attribution errors found

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening paragraph's "not abandonment — revision" framing
- Circularity argument against methodological naturalism as demarcation criterion
- "Federation of domains" metaphor for the modified unity of science
- Honest acknowledgment of dualism's limitations as a research programme
- Functional vs. ontological demarcation distinction
- Epistemic asymmetry argument (refined but preserved)

### Enhancements Made
- Integrated Fodor's (1974) argument into the Unity of Science section, strengthening the case with an independent argument for scientific disunity
- Refined the epistemological asymmetry argument to engage fairly with the physicalist position before pressing the dualist point
- Added nuance to the Lakatosian assessment with physicalist counterargument and dualist response
- Added cross-link to `consciousness-and-the-problem-of-theoretical-virtues` in the theory choice section

### Cross-links Added
- [consciousness-and-the-limits-of-explanation](/topics/consciousness-and-the-limits-of-explanation/) (replacing archived reference)
- [consciousness-and-the-problem-of-theoretical-virtues](/topics/consciousness-and-the-problem-of-theoretical-virtues/)

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues addressed.

## Stability Notes

- The six adversarial personas (Churchland, Dennett, Tegmark, Deutsch, Popper, Nagarjuna) all have fundamental philosophical disagreements with the article's dualist framework. These are bedrock disagreements, not fixable flaws. Future reviews should not re-flag "materialist finds this unconvincing" as a critical issue.
- The article's Lakatosian assessment of materialism as "theoretically degenerating" will always be contested by physicalists. The current treatment (acknowledging the counterargument, then pressing the easy/hard problem distinction) represents a fair equilibrium. Future reviews should not oscillate on this.
