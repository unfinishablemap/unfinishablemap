# Deep Review: Retrocausality

**Date**: 2026-01-21
**File**: obsidian/concepts/retrocausality.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Six adversarial philosopher perspectives were applied:

### Eliminative Materialist (Churchland)
- **Concern**: Article assumes consciousness exists without engaging illusionist challenge
- **Resolution**: Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section with three responses (regress problem, introspection survives, functional asymmetry)

### Hard-Nosed Physicalist (Dennett)
- **Concern**: Schurger's noise interpretation dismissed too quickly
- **Assessment**: The existing engagement with Schurger is adequate; the new "What Would Challenge This View?" section explicitly acknowledges that success of alternative Libet resolutions would challenge the framework

### Quantum Skeptic (Tegmark)
- **Concern**: Decoherence challenge not addressed for retrocausal influences
- **Resolution**: Added "The Decoherence Challenge" section with three mitigating considerations

### Many-Worlds Defender (Deutsch)
- **Concern**: MWI-retrocausality interactions not engaged
- **Assessment**: Low priority; covered in other articles. Added note in No Many Worlds tenet section

### Empiricist (Popper's Ghost)
- **Concern**: No falsifiability conditions specified
- **Resolution**: Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section with 5 specific conditions

### Buddhist Philosopher (Nagarjuna)
- **Concern**: Article assumes substantial self doing the selecting
- **Resolution**: Added contemplative evidence section including Buddhist cessation states; connected to witness consciousness which addresses the "who selects" question through non-substantial awareness

### Critical Issues Found
- None (no factual errors or contradictions)

### Medium Issues Found
- Missing illusionist challenge: Resolved with new section
- Missing decoherence treatment: Resolved with new section
- Missing falsifiability conditions: Resolved with new section
- Missing contemplative perspectives: Resolved with new section
- Thin "Relation to Site Perspective": Resolved with expansion to all 5 tenets

### Counterarguments Considered
- Illusionist dissolution of the problem → Addressed via regress and functional asymmetry responses
- Decoherence blocking retrocausal influences → Addressed via clarification that retrocausality operates at measurement, not during coherence
- Schurger making retrocausality unnecessary → Acknowledged as legitimate challenge in "What Would Challenge This View?"

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

Six sympathetic philosopher perspectives were applied:

### Strengths Preserved
- Strong opening summary stating the core thesis clearly
- The fundamental argument that temporal precedence doesn't establish causal priority
- Motor selection corroboration section (independent domain evidence)
- Time ontology section with "modified growing block" proposal
- Clear objections/responses structure

### Enhancements Made
- Added "The Decoherence Challenge" section (3 responses)
- Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section (3 responses)
- Added "Contemplative Evidence" section (3 subsections: witness consciousness, phenomenology of decision, cessation states)
- Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section (3 subsections: actual occasions, eternal objects, why the framework fits)
- Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section (5 falsifiability conditions)
- Expanded "Relation to Site Perspective" from 3 paragraphs to substantive engagement with all 5 tenets

### Cross-links Added
- [illusionism](/concepts/illusionism/)
- [decoherence](/concepts/decoherence/)
- [witness-consciousness](/concepts/witness-consciousness/)
- [haecceity](/concepts/haecceity/)
- [introspection](/concepts/introspection/)
- [free-will](/topics/free-will/) (topic)

### New References Added
- Schurger et al. (2012) - accumulator model
- Sjöberg (2024) - SMA lesions
- Whitehead (1929) - Process and Reality
- Kastner (2013) - Transactional interpretation book
- Wharton (2015) - Universe not a computer

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues were addressed in this review session.

## Summary

The retrocausality article was comprehensive in its core argument but lacked the standard sections that other deep-reviewed articles have (illusionist challenge, decoherence challenge, contemplative evidence, process philosophy perspective, falsifiability conditions, full 5-tenet engagement). These gaps have been filled while preserving the article's distinctive contribution: showing how retrocausality dissolves the Libet objection to conscious causation. The article now integrates fully with the site's evolving standard for concept pages.
