# Deep Review: Quantum Measurement Interpretations Beyond Many-Worlds

**Date**: 2026-01-28
**File**: obsidian/topics/quantum-measurement-interpretations-beyond-mwi.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-25
**Cross-review context**: quantum-measurement-and-subjective-probability.md insights

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The previous review (2026-01-25) resolved all critical issues, and the article remains sound. Key resolutions from that review (honest limitation paragraph, MWI engagement with Wallace/Saunders, mechanism caveats) are preserved.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **QBism section lacked phenomenological critique connection**
   - *Issue*: The new subjective-probability article provides a detailed critique of QBism's phenomenological gap that strengthens this section.
   - *Resolution*: Added cross-link to subjective-probability article with brief note on how experience has determinate content that belief updating cannot ground.

2. **Transactional section missed process philosophy connection**
   - *Issue*: The subjective-probability article introduces "actual occasions" framework which is relevant to atemporal selection.
   - *Resolution*: Added connection to process philosophy—transactions as actual occasions where indeterminacy resolves into actuality.

3. **"Why This Matters" section lacked indexical dimension**
   - *Issue*: The subjective-probability article's indexical reading of Born probabilities ("probability that *I* experience spin-up") deepens the argument.
   - *Resolution*: Added new paragraph on the indexical dimension, cross-linking to subjective-probability article.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Eliminative materialist**: Article already acknowledges consciousness-based interpretations are minority positions.
- **Dennett on determinism**: The Map's commitment to libertarian free will is a tenet-level position, not a flaw to fix.
- **Buddhist non-self**: Process philosophy connection addresses this by framing consciousness in terms of momentary occasions rather than substantial selves.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Clear interpretation-by-interpretation structure with "Relation to the Map" subsections
- "Honest limitation" paragraph upfront acknowledging speculative status
- Wallace/Saunders engagement on self-locating uncertainty
- "Important caveat" in transactional section about mechanism specification
- Free will connection in conclusion

### Enhancements Made

1. QBism section: Added cross-link to subjective-probability article's phenomenological critique
2. Transactional section: Added process philosophy connection (actual occasions framework)
3. Why This Matters: Added indexical dimension paragraph
4. Further Reading: Added links to [quantum-measurement-and-subjective-probability](/topics/quantum-measurement-and-subjective-probability/) and [process-philosophy](/concepts/process-philosophy/)

### Cross-links Added

- [quantum-measurement-and-subjective-probability](/topics/quantum-measurement-and-subjective-probability/)
- [process-philosophy](/concepts/process-philosophy/)

## Word Count

- Before: 1812 words (60% of 3000 target)
- After: 1946 words (65% of 3000 target)
- Change: +134 words

## Remaining Items

None. The article now integrates insights from the cross-review with the subjective-probability article while maintaining all strengths from the previous review.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed twice. Key philosophical standoffs that should NOT be re-flagged:

1. **MWI proponents will always find the indexical argument unsatisfying**—this is a bedrock disagreement, not a flaw. The Wallace/Saunders engagement acknowledges this.

2. **Bohmian defenders will reject the "free will phenomenology" argument**—this reflects the Map's tenet-level commitment to non-illusory agency, not an oversight.

3. **QBism proponents consider their silence on consciousness a feature**—the article now notes this explicitly. The Map disagrees but the disagreement is acknowledged.

The article has reached a stable state. Future reviews should focus on factual updates (new physics surveys, new interpretations) rather than re-arguing philosophical positions that have been explicitly engaged.
