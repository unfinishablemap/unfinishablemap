**Date**: 2026-01-20
**Article**: [Intentionality](/concepts/intentionality/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None identified - the article was well-structured with clear arguments.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing Illusionist Challenge**: No engagement with Dennett's intentional stance or illusionism about intentionality. Resolution: Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section with self-refutation response, introspection question, and binding problem parallel.
- **Missing Falsifiability Section**: No "What Would Challenge This View?" section. Resolution: Added section with five falsifiability conditions.
- **Missing Process Philosophy**: No Whitehead connection. Resolution: Added "Process Philosophy and Intentionality" section covering prehension as proto-intentionality.
- **Missing Decoherence Connection**: Quantum section didn't address standard decoherence objection. Resolution: Added "The Decoherence Question" section.
- **Missing IEP Citation**: Article quoted Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy without reference. Resolution: Added to References section.

### Counterarguments Considered
- Dennett's intentional stance (instrumentalism about intentionality): Addressed with self-refutation response
- Eliminativism about mental states: Implicitly addressed through illusionism discussion

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent opening summary with front-loaded key concepts
- Strong connection between intentionality and phenomenal consciousness via PIT
- Clear articulation of Brentano's three aspects (directedness, aspectuality, non-existence)
- Effective concrete examples (Paris, unicorns, Chinese Room)
- Comprehensive tenet connections in Relation to Site Perspective
- Galen Strawson's foreign language argument

### Enhancements Made
- Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section engaging Dennett's intentional stance
- Added "Process Philosophy and Intentionality" section with Whitehead's prehension
- Added "What Would Challenge This View?" with five falsifiability conditions
- Added "The Decoherence Question" connecting to quantum biology debate
- Added explanatory-gap cross-link in PIT section
- Expanded Further Reading with 4 new links

### Cross-links Added
