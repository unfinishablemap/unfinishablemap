# Tenet Alignment Check

**Date**: 2026-01-27
**Files checked**: 134 (34 topics + 100 concepts)
**Errors**: 0
**Warnings**: 5
**Notes**: 8

## Summary

All content in the topics and concepts directories aligns with the five foundational tenets. No direct contradictions or errors were found. The identified warnings and notes reflect:

1. **Intentional philosophical contrast**: Some articles (RQM, IIT, GWT) document alternative frameworks to clarify what the Map rejects—these are pedagogically valuable, not tenet violations
2. **Underdeveloped connections**: Some articles don't explicitly address all five tenets, though none contradict them
3. **Philosophical tensions acknowledged**: Where genuine philosophical complexity exists (e.g., Buddhist compatibility, idealism comparison), articles honestly explore rather than hide the tensions

## Warnings

### 1. relational-quantum-mechanics.md
- **Tenets affected**: Minimal Quantum Interaction, Bidirectional Interaction
- **Issue**: RQM explicitly removes consciousness from physics; article documents direct incompatibility with Map's framework
- **Quote**: "RQM explicitly removes consciousness from physics... consciousness cannot influence physical outcomes through quantum mechanisms. The Map's central claim fails."
- **Recommendation**: No change needed—the article correctly positions RQM as a rejected alternative that clarifies the Map's position through contrast

### 2. integrated-information-theory.md
- **Tenets affected**: Bidirectional Interaction
- **Issue**: IIT's identity thesis (consciousness IS integrated information) conflicts with causal efficacy requirement
- **Quote**: "The Map's framework requires consciousness be *causally efficacious*... IIT has no room for this."
- **Recommendation**: No change needed—the article fairly presents IIT while noting where it diverges from the Map's interactionist commitments

### 3. global-workspace-theory.md
- **Tenets affected**: Bidirectional Interaction
- **Issue**: GWT frames causation as bottom-up (neural competition for workspace), while the Map requires consciousness to actively select
- **Quote**: "GWT frames the flow as bottom-up: sensory information competes for workspace access... The Bidirectional Interaction tenet holds that consciousness *selects* which information achieves ignition"
- **Recommendation**: Consider adding clarification that GWT describes correlates of consciousness, not consciousness itself, and that the Map reframes GWT's "competition" as "selection" to preserve bidirectional causation

### 4. idealism.md
- **Tenets affected**: Bidirectional Interaction
- **Issue**: Idealism's treatment of matter as "appearance" undermines meaningful inter-domain causation
- **Quote**: "If 'physical reality' is merely how consciousness appears to itself, the interaction becomes intra-mental rather than genuinely inter-domain"
- **Recommendation**: No change needed—the article explicitly chooses interactionist dualism over idealism to preserve bidirectional interaction

### 5. attention-as-interface.md
- **Tenets affected**: No Many Worlds
- **Issue**: Notes MWI would make selection "systematically misleading" but frames this as challenge rather than direct support
- **Quote**: "If all branches actualize (MWI), there's nothing for attention to select... The phenomenology of attention *as selection* presupposes genuine alternatives"
- **Recommendation**: Minor—article supports tenet but could more explicitly affirm rejection of MWI rather than just noting the challenge

## Notes

### 1. problem-of-other-minds.md
- **Observation**: Doesn't address quantum mechanics connection (Tenet 2); frames dualism as creating difficulties for other-minds knowledge rather than solving them
- **Assessment**: Philosophically appropriate—the article honestly acknowledges the epistemological challenge dualism faces

### 2. psychophysical-coupling-mechanisms.md
- **Observation**: Doesn't explicitly discuss Many Worlds; treats Occam's Razor as a challenge to meet rather than supporting tenet
- **Assessment**: The article is mechanism-focused; MWI discussion may not be directly relevant here

### 3. pairing-problem.md
- **Observation**: Doesn't explicitly address MWI; primarily defensive rather than positive tenet exposition
- **Assessment**: Article focuses on answering Kim's objection specifically

### 4. nihilism.md
- **Observation**: Tangential to core tenets—addresses meaning/value rather than consciousness mechanics
- **Assessment**: Valuable philosophical context but lighter tenet engagement than consciousness-focused articles

### 5. purpose-and-alignment.md (topic)
- **Observation**: Bandwidth argument could be more rigorously justified
- **Assessment**: Minor refinement opportunity; overall alignment is strong

### 6. time-perception-consciousness-theories.md (topic)
- **Observation**: Could more explicitly separate temporal processing explanation from phenomenology explanation
- **Assessment**: Implicit distinction is present; explicit clarification would strengthen

### 7. death-and-consciousness.md (topic)
- **Observation**: Buddhist philosophy section raises genuine tensions with indexical identity commitment without full resolution
- **Assessment**: Appropriate philosophical honesty about unresolved questions

### 8. embodied-cognition.md
- **Observation**: Distinguishes substance dualism (rejected) from property dualism (supported)
- **Assessment**: Methodologically sound clarification, not a tenet conflict

## Cross-File Patterns

### Strengths
1. **Internal consistency**: The framework maintains coherence across 134 files spanning diverse philosophical topics
2. **Objection engagement**: Articles systematically address and rebut major challenges (illusionism, functionalism, many-worlds, causal closure)
3. **Empirical integration**: Quantum mechanisms are consistently grounded in recent research (2024-2025 evidence)
4. **Philosophical sophistication**: Complex positions (process philosophy, Buddhist compatibility, cognitive closure) are handled with appropriate nuance
5. **Tenet interconnection**: The five tenets form an integrated system rather than isolated claims

### Tenet Coverage Summary
| Tenet | Strong Support | Mentioned | Not Addressed |
|-------|---------------|-----------|---------------|
| 1. Dualism | 128 | 6 | 0 |
| 2. Minimal Quantum Interaction | 98 | 28 | 8 |
| 3. Bidirectional Interaction | 120 | 14 | 0 |
| 4. No Many Worlds | 105 | 22 | 7 |
| 5. Occam's Razor Has Limits | 118 | 16 | 0 |

### Notable Patterns
- **Tenet 1 (Dualism)**: Universal support—all articles either directly argue for or presuppose consciousness irreducibility
- **Tenet 2 (Minimal Quantum Interaction)**: Well-developed in quantum-focused articles; appropriately absent from purely philosophical discussions
- **Tenet 3 (Bidirectional Interaction)**: Strong support through multiple evidence streams (neuroplasticity, choking, motor control, contemplative evidence)
- **Tenet 4 (No Many Worlds)**: Explicitly defended in physics-engaged articles; implicit in others through indexical identity assumptions
- **Tenet 5 (Occam's Razor)**: Consistently deployed against premature physicalist simplification

## Recommendations

### No Immediate Action Required
The content is internally consistent and well-aligned with foundational tenets. The warnings identify intentional philosophical contrasts (alternative frameworks documented for pedagogical clarity) rather than errors.

### Consider for Future Refinement
1. **GWT article**: Add explicit clarification that GWT is treated as describing correlates, not constituting consciousness
2. **Attention-as-interface**: Strengthen explicit affirmation of MWI rejection
3. **Cross-referencing**: Some articles with implicit tenet support could benefit from explicit "Relation to Site Perspective" sections

## Conclusion

The Unfinishable Map's content demonstrates remarkable internal consistency across its philosophical framework. All 134 files in the topics and concepts directories maintain alignment with the five foundational tenets. Where philosophical complexity exists (alternative frameworks, Buddhist perspectives, indexical identity challenges), the content engages honestly rather than hiding tensions. The framework is well-integrated, empirically grounded, and philosophically sophisticated.
