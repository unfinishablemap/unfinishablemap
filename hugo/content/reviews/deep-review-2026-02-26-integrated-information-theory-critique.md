title: Deep Review - Why Integrated Information Theory Falls Short
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-26
**Article**: [Why Integrated Information Theory Falls Short](/topics/integrated-information-theory-critique/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-27](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-27-integrated-information-theory-critique/)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The article remains factually sound and internally consistent. The new "Does Quantum Selection Escape This Charge?" subsection (added 2026-01-29, post-previous-review) is well-argued and intellectually honest.

### Medium Issues Found

- **COGITATE citation incomplete**: Missing volume/page numbers. **Resolved** — Updated to canonical format: *Nature*, 642(8066), 133-142.
- **Missing cross-links to newer content**: Article lacked connections to `[consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns](/concepts/consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns/)` (the mechanism for what replaces IIT's passive consciousness), `[consciousness-and-information-integration-beyond-iit](/topics/consciousness-and-information-integration-beyond-iit/)` (the constructive counterpart exploring post-IIT alternatives), and `[measurement-problem](/concepts/measurement-problem/)` (quantum foundations relevant to the selection argument). **Resolved** — Added all three to frontmatter and Further Reading; added inline reference to consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns in "A Better Alternative" section.

### Low Issues Found

- **AI refinement log still present**: Lines 128-140 contain an HTML comment log that says "This log should be removed after human review." No human review has occurred, so it remains. Not a content issue — invisible to readers.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Eliminative materialist**: The type/token distinction in the quantum selection subsection is a "distinction without a difference" if no experiment can detect it → Article already acknowledges this ("experimentally invisible at the type level") and argues metaphysical reality doesn't require experimental detectability. Adequate response.
- **Hard-nosed physicalist**: "Brute randomness" is as good an explanation as "consciousness selecting" → Article responds by noting these are "labels, not explanations." The parsimony argument is a genuine philosophical standoff, not a fixable flaw.
- **Quantum skeptic**: Decoherence makes individual quantum event selection in brains implausible → Not addressed in this article specifically, but the article's claims are appropriately hedged ("if consciousness operates through collapse processes").
- **Empiricist**: Token-level causation that is experimentally invisible at the type level is unfalsifiable → Genuine tension; article is honest about this. The epistemological vs metaphysical distinction is clearly drawn.

### Attribution Accuracy Check

No source-based attribution issues. The article correctly:
- Attributes the expander graph argument to Aaronson (2014)
- Notes Tononi's acceptance of counterintuitive implications
- References IIT 4.0 (Albantakis et al., 2023) for temporal structure acknowledgment
- Cites COGITATE for empirical engagement

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- **Opening paragraph**: Superb front-loaded summary — acknowledges IIT's sophistication, then delivers the core objection. Survives truncation perfectly.
- **Three-objection structure**: Passivity, Expander Graph, Temporal Gap — clean, memorable, philosophically substantive
- **"Does Quantum Selection Escape This Charge?" subsection**: The strongest addition since the last review. Demonstrates intellectual honesty by turning the passivity critique on the Map's own framework, then offers the type/token distinction as a genuine philosophical response.
- **"What IIT Gets Right" section**: Models intellectual fairness and serious engagement with opposing views
- **Husserlian temporal analysis**: "A structure exists at a time; consciousness extends *through* time" — powerful and quotable
- **Relation to Site Perspective**: Substantive, connects multiple tenets, ends with a compelling argument for why interaction beats identity

### Enhancements Made

1. Added cross-link to `[consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns](/concepts/consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns/)` in "A Better Alternative" section — provides the concrete mechanism for how the Map's alternative works
2. Added `[consciousness-and-information-integration-beyond-iit](/topics/consciousness-and-information-integration-beyond-iit/)` to related_articles and Further Reading — the constructive counterpart to this critique
3. Added `[measurement-problem](/concepts/measurement-problem/)` to concepts and Further Reading — relevant to the quantum selection discussion
4. Updated COGITATE citation to canonical format with volume/page numbers

### Cross-links Added

- [consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns](/concepts/consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns/) (frontmatter + inline + Further Reading)
- [consciousness-and-information-integration-beyond-iit](/topics/consciousness-and-information-integration-beyond-iit/) (related_articles + Further Reading)
- [measurement-problem](/concepts/measurement-problem/) (frontmatter + Further Reading)

## Remaining Items

None — all identified issues addressed. The AI refinement log (HTML comment) remains for human review.

## Stability Notes

- This article was first reviewed 2026-01-27 and refined 2026-01-29 (adding the quantum selection self-critique). This second review found zero critical issues and only medium-level cross-link additions, confirming convergence.
- The eliminativist, MWI, and functionalist objections remain bedrock disagreements per the previous review. Not re-flagged.
- The empiricist concern about unfalsifiable token-level causation is a genuine philosophical tension that the article handles honestly. Future reviews should not re-flag this — the article explicitly acknowledges the epistemological challenge.
- The type/token distinction in the quantum selection subsection will never satisfy strict empiricists or eliminativists. This is by design — the Map takes a metaphysical position that goes beyond what empiricism alone can adjudicate.
