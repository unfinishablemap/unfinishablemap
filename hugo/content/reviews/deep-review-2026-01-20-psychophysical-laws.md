# Deep Review: Psychophysical Laws

**Date**: 2026-01-20
**File**: obsidian/concepts/psychophysical-laws.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Missing illusionist engagement**: Article assumed phenomenal properties are "ontologically basic" without engaging the strongest eliminativist response.
   - **Resolution**: Added comprehensive "The Illusionist Challenge" section with three illusionist arguments and the site's regress-based response.

2. **Missing decoherence engagement**: Quantum mechanisms presented without addressing the standard objection.
   - **Resolution**: Added "The Decoherence Challenge" subsection with three responses (measurement problem, quantum biology, Zeno mechanism).

3. **Missing "What Would Challenge This View?" section**: Required by site standards for falsifiability.
   - **Resolution**: Added section with five falsifiability conditions.

4. **Missing process philosophy perspective**: No engagement with Whitehead's actual occasions framework.
   - **Resolution**: Added comprehensive "Process Philosophy Perspective" section connecting upward/downward laws to Whitehead's physical/mental poles.

5. **Incomplete tenet coverage**: "Relation to Site Perspective" covered only 4 of 5 tenets.
   - **Resolution**: Added Occam's Razor Has Limits tenet connection.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Missing cross-links**: Key concepts (illusionism, introspection, decoherence, haecceity, witness-consciousness) not linked.
   - **Resolution**: Added all five to concepts array and Further Reading section.

2. **Missing contemplative evidence**: No phenomenological data about psychophysical relationships.
   - **Resolution**: Added "Contemplative Evidence" section covering witness consciousness, mental effort, and quiet mind states.

3. **Haecceity connection underexplored**: Rejection of organizational invariance not connected to haecceity.
   - **Resolution**: Added "Haecceity and Organizational Invariance" subsection explaining the connection.

4. **Research notes not in Further Reading**: chalmers-psychophysical-laws-2026-01-17 mentioned but not linked in Further Reading.
   - **Resolution**: Added to Further Reading section.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Illusionist parsimony argument**: If neuroscience can explain belief in consciousness without phenomenal properties, psychophysical laws are unnecessary.
  - **Response**: Added Moorean response (existence of pain more evident than illusionist premises) and regress argument (illusion requires experiencer).

- **Tegmark decoherence objection**: Quantum coherence decays too fast for consciousness to exploit.
  - **Response**: Added three-part response: decoherence doesn't solve measurement problem; biological systems maintain longer coherence than expected; Zeno mechanism doesn't require sustained coherence.

- **MWI dissolution**: Many-worlds removes the need for selection laws.
  - **Response**: Added to falsifiability section as condition that would challenge the view.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Excellent explanation of supervenience vs. causal laws distinction
- Clear articulation of Chalmers' three principles
- Five Constraints on Dualist Laws section well-developed
- Distinctive treatment of bandwidth constraints
- Clear statement of where site diverges from Chalmers

### Enhancements Made

1. **Decoherence Challenge section**: Three-part response showing why the objection isn't decisive
2. **Illusionist Challenge section**: Comprehensive engagement with Dennett/Frankish position
3. **Process Philosophy Perspective**: Whitehead's actual occasions as complementary framework
4. **Contemplative Evidence section**: Phenomenological data (witness, effort, quiet mind)
5. **Haecceity and Organizational Invariance**: Connected rejection of functionalism to haecceitistic identity
6. **What Would Challenge This View?**: Five falsifiability conditions
7. **Expanded Relation to Site Perspective**: Now covers all 5 tenets
