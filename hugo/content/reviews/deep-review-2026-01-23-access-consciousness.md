**Article**: [Access Consciousness](/concepts/access-consciousness/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Missing citation for Nartker et al. 2025**: The article cited this research on inattentional blindness without including it in References. Resolution: Added full citation to References section.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Deflationary response to overflow too brief**: The original article dismissed the deflationary response to Block's overflow argument in one sentence, failing to engage Dennett and Cohen's serious objections. Resolution: Expanded to two paragraphs explaining the confabulation hypothesis and acknowledging that deflationary theorists can interpret the Nartker findings as degraded access rather than rich phenomenology.

- **Stapp quantum mechanism presented without qualification**: The quantum Zeno mechanism was described with confidence despite being speculative. Resolution: Added "which remains speculative and contested among physicists" qualifier.

- **MWI section lacked engagement with proponents' best arguments**: The article dismissed Many-Worlds without addressing sophisticated responses like Deutsch-Wallace decision theory. Resolution: Added two paragraphs presenting MWI's self-locating uncertainty response and the dualist rejoinder that this presupposes what it needs to explain.

### Counterarguments Considered
- Cohen & Dennett's deflationary response to overflow—now properly engaged
- MWI proponents' self-locating uncertainty—now presented before rebuttal

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- The process philosophy section mapping Whitehead's subjective immediacy/objective immortality onto access/phenomenal distinction (excellent original synthesis)
- The two-stage model clearly articulating consciousness-attention-action chain
- The argument that acknowledging A-consciousness strengthens dualism
- Treatment of cognitive phenomenology presenting both positions fairly

### Enhancements Made
- Added connection between explanatory gap and mysterianism/cognitive closure
- Added link to conservation-laws-and-mind for the quantum interaction section
- Added link to indexical-identity-quantum-measurement for the MWI section
- Added Cohen & Dennett (2011) citation to References

### Cross-links Added
- [mysterianism-cognitive-closure](/mysterianism-cognitive-closure/) - in Dualism tenet section
- [indexical-identity-quantum-measurement](/topics/indexical-identity-quantum-measurement/) - in No Many Worlds section
- [conservation-laws-and-mind](/topics/conservation-laws-and-mind/) - in Minimal Quantum Interaction section
