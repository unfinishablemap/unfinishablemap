title: Deep Review - History of Interactionist Dualism (Orphan Integration)
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Article**: [History of Interactionist Dualism](/topics/history-of-interactionist-dualism/)
**Previous review**: [2026-02-02](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-02-history-of-interactionist-dualism/) (earlier today)
**Focus**: Orphan integration—adding inbound links from related articles

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The previous review (earlier today) addressed all critical issues. The article is historically accurate, well-sourced, and appropriately hedged.

### Medium Issues Found

None new. The article was in stable condition following the earlier review.

### Counterarguments Considered

All six adversarial personas were engaged. Their objections represent bedrock philosophical disagreements rather than fixable flaws:

1. **Eliminative Materialist**: Objects to the "quantum opening" narrative as overstating significance
2. **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: Argues functionalism's progress is understated
3. **Quantum Skeptic**: Decoherence concerns (appropriately deferred to specialized articles)
4. **MWI Defender**: Collapse assumption contested (Map rejects MWI per Tenet 4)
5. **Empiricist**: Unfalsifiability concern (article hedges appropriately with "speculative")
6. **Buddhist Philosopher**: Questions substantial self assumption (deep metaphysical disagreement)

These represent the contested philosophical landscape, not article deficiencies.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

All strengths from previous review remain intact:
- Opening paragraph with excellent truncation resilience
- Elizabeth's two-component analysis (conceptual vs. mechanism problems)
- "The Leibniz Closure" and "The Quantum Opening" as framing devices
- Pitts/Cucu argument presentation
- "The Shape of Progress" synthesis section
- Honest epistemic hedging ("None of this proves interactionism true")

### Enhancements Made

**This review focused on orphan integration.** The article had no inbound links—other articles discussed the same historical figures and events but didn't link to this comprehensive treatment.

### Cross-links Added (FROM other articles TO this article)

Seven articles now link to [history-of-interactionist-dualism](/topics/history-of-interactionist-dualism/):

1. **[substance-property-dualism](/concepts/substance-property-dualism/)** — After the Elizabeth/Leibniz objection discussion
2. **[interactionist-dualism](/archive/arguments/interactionist-dualism/)** — In "The Historical Problem" section
3. **[dualism](/concepts/dualism/)** — In "The Interaction Problem" section
4. **[conservation-laws-and-mind](/topics/conservation-laws-and-mind/)** — In the opening paragraph mentioning Leibniz
5. **[emergence](/concepts/emergence/)** — After the Broad/Alexander discussion
6. **[epiphenomenalism](/arguments/epiphenomenalism/)** — After the Huxley 1874 mention
7. **[leibnizs-mill-argument](/topics/leibnizs-mill-argument/)** — After discussing Leibniz's ongoing relevance

## Remaining Items

None. The article is well-integrated into the site's navigation structure.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed twice in one day and is highly stable:

- Content is historically accurate (verified in first review)
- Attribution claims properly sourced
- Appropriate epistemic hedging throughout
- Good connection to site tenets
- Now well-linked from related articles

The adversarial persona objections are bedrock philosophical disagreements:
- **MWI alternative** — Map explicitly rejects Many-Worlds (Tenet 4)
- **Materialist progress claims** — Contested philosophical territory
- **Unfalsifiability concerns** — Article acknowledges speculative nature

Future reviews should NOT re-flag these. The article has reached stability.
