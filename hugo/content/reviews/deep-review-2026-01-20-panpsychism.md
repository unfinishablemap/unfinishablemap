title: Deep Review - Panpsychism
topics: []

**Date**: 2026-01-20
**Article**: [Panpsychism](/concepts/panpsychism/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None critical

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing Whitehead context**: The article lacked engagement with Whitehead's process philosophy, a foundational precursor to contemporary panpsychism. → Added new "Whitehead and the Process Tradition" subsection explaining actual occasions, prehension, and the process reframing of the combination problem.
- **No falsifiability discussion**: The article didn't address the common objection that panpsychism is unfalsifiable. → Added new "Can Panpsychism Be Tested?" section covering weak falsifiability, IIT testability, UAL behavioral markers, and cognitive closure challenges.
- **Missing cross-links**: No connection to buddhism-and-dualism.md (relevant to subject-summing dissolution) or mysterianism.md (relevant to cognitive closure). → Added both to frontmatter concepts and Further Reading.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminativist challenge**: The article accepts the hard problem as genuine without sufficiently engaging with eliminativist responses. This is acceptable given The Unfinishable Map's tenet commitments, but noted.
- **Cognitive closure**: Added mysterianism cross-link to acknowledge that the combination problem might exceed human cognitive capacities.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Strong opening summary that survives truncation
- Excellent engagement with Chalmers' panprotopsychism distinction
- Well-structured presentation of combination problem variants
- Good comparative table (Key Differences)
- Fair treatment of panpsychism's strengths alongside critique
- Comprehensive Further Reading section

### Enhancements Made
1. **Whitehead section**: Added historical context through Whitehead's process philosophy—actual occasions, prehension, "drops of experience"
2. **Falsifiability section**: New section addressing empirical testability through IIT, UAL, and acknowledging cognitive closure limits
3. **References expanded**: Added Whitehead (1929), Seager (1995), Nagel (2012)
4. **Cross-links**: Added buddhism-and-dualism.md and mysterianism.md connections

### Cross-links Added
- [buddhism-and-dualism](/concepts/buddhism-and-dualism/) — Buddhist no-self perspectives on subjects
- [mysterianism](/concepts/mysterianism/) — Cognitive closure considerations
