**Date**: 2026-01-20
**Article**: [Quantum Indeterminacy and Free Will](/concepts/quantum-indeterminacy-free-will/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Missing falsifiability section**: The article lacked a comprehensive "What Would Challenge This View?" section. This was a serious omission for a site that values empirical grounding. **Resolution**: Expanded the existing section with two additional falsifiability conditions (MWI confirmation, selection indistinguishable from randomness).

- **No illusionism engagement**: The article dismissed the epiphenomenalist/illusionist interpretation without directly engaging it. Given Dennett's influence and the strength of the challenge, this needed addressing. **Resolution**: Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section with the self-undermining response and choking phenomenon evidence.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Decoherence challenge underdeveloped**: The article mentioned the decoherence objection but only briefly, without a dedicated section. **Resolution**: Added "The Decoherence Challenge" section with three distinct responses (measurement problem, Zeno mechanism, quantum biology).

- **Missing process philosophy perspective**: No discussion of Whitehead's actual occasions, which would strengthen the agent-causal picture from an unexpected direction. **Resolution**: Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section presenting Whitehead's framework as complementary metaphysics.

- **Insufficient cross-links**: Missing connections to illusionism.md, decoherence.md, pairing-problem.md, phenomenal-unity.md. **Resolution**: Added 4 new cross-links to frontmatter and 4 to Further Reading.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Illusionism**: Addressed with self-refutation argument and choking phenomenon evidence
- **Decoherence objection**: Addressed with three-part response
- **Process philosophy alternative**: Presented as complementary rather than competing framework

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- The luck objection response (excellent systematization in table format)
- Kane's 2024 convergence integration
- Motor selection parallel evidence (strengthens the case through independent domain)
- Core systematization structure (libertarian dilemma → event-causal/agent-causal → luck objection → site response → Zeno mechanism → retrocausality → causal closure)
- The "selection vs randomness" table
- Phenomenology of effort section

### Enhancements Made
1. Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section engaging Dennett/Frankish with self-refutation response and choking evidence
2. Added "The Decoherence Challenge" section with three-part response (measurement problem, Zeno sidestep, quantum biology evidence)
3. Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" presenting Whitehead's actual occasions as complementary framework
4. Expanded falsifiability section with two additional conditions
5. Added references for Dennett, Frankish, Tegmark, Whitehead, Wiest et al.

### Cross-links Added
**Frontmatter:**
- [illusionism](/concepts/illusionism/)
- [decoherence](/concepts/decoherence/)
- [pairing-problem](/concepts/pairing-problem/)
