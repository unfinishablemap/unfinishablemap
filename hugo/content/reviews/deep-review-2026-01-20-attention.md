title: Deep Review - Attention and Consciousness
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-01-20
**Article**: [Attention and Consciousness](/attention/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Missing falsifiability section**: No "What Would Challenge This View?" section. Resolved by adding five falsification conditions covering computational sufficiency, dissociation reversal, Zeno mechanism failure, illusionist success, and many-worlds confirmation.
- **Decoherence challenge unaddressed**: Article referenced Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism without acknowledging the standard objection. Resolved by adding "The Decoherence Challenge" subsection with brief treatment and pointer to decoherence.md.
- **Vague citations**: "A 2020 study" and "A neurofeedback study" lacked specific references. Resolved by adding author citations (Maheshwari & Bhowmik; Brewer et al.).

### Medium Issues Found
- **Mysterian angle missing**: The "deadlock" in the dissociation debate could benefit from cognitive closure perspective. Resolved by adding "The Mysterian Angle" subsection.
- **Process philosophy perspective absent**: No engagement with Whitehead despite relevance to attention-as-selection. Resolved by adding "Process Philosophy Perspective" subsection.

### Counterarguments Considered
- Eliminative materialist: Phenomenology of effort is just neural activity. Response: the article already distinguishes correlation from identity.
- AST challenge: If attention modelling explains consciousness computationally, interface adds nothing. Response: existing section addresses the regress problem.
- Quantum skeptic: Tegmark's calculation challenges Stapp mechanism. Response: new subsection addresses this with pointers to full treatment.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent dissociation evidence (Koch & Tsuchiya, Block's overflow, Nartker 2025)
- Strong meditation section with clear FA/OM distinction and neural signatures
- Clear presentation of Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism
- Good engagement with competing theories (GWT, IIT, AST)
- Working memory section connecting to interface hypothesis

### Enhancements Made
- Added "The Mysterian Angle" subsection connecting to cognitive closure
- Added "The Decoherence Challenge" with brief response and pointer
- Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" presenting Whitehead's actual occasions
- Added comprehensive "What Would Challenge This View?" section
- Specified previously vague study citations
