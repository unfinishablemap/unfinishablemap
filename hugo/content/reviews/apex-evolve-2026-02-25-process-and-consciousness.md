[Process and Consciousness](/apex/process-and-consciousness/)

## Changed Sources

2 sources modified since last synthesis (2026-02-02T10:10:00+00:00):

1. **[temporal-consciousness](/concepts/temporal-consciousness/)** — modified 2026-02-17 (15 days stale). Significantly expanded through coalescence: now covers specious present with nested timescales, Bergson's durée, phenomenological method, working memory as neural correlate, mental time travel, temporal binding, temporal unity and disruption (schizophrenia, flow states), quantum consciousness connections, process philosophy perspective, illusionist challenge, and implications for machine consciousness.

2. **[phenomenal-unity](/concepts/unity-of-consciousness/)** — modified 2026-02-24 (22 days stale). Newly created article covering subsumptive unity and conjoint phenomenology (Bayne & Chalmers), distinctions from access unity/binding problem/representational unity, the structural mismatch argument for dualism, challenges (illusionism, split-brain cases), and connection to the combination problem and emergence void.

## Pessimistic Review

### Clarity Critic
- The "process haecceitism" paragraph was placed at the end of "Dualism Through Process" without adequate setup—haecceity hadn't been introduced. It belonged in the "Against Many Worlds" section where identity is central.
- The Stapp reference felt somewhat thin—name-dropped without full integration of his argument.

### Redundancy Hunter
- "Against Many Worlds" opening had two consecutive sentences saying process philosophy aligns with rejecting many-worlds.
- "Consciousness cannot emerge from non-conscious matter" appeared in similar forms three times across the article.
- Concrescence was explained three times with overlapping content.

### Narrative Flow Analyst
- The tenet-structured argument builds well overall.
- The haecceity paragraph broke the transition from "Dualism Through Process" to "Minimal Interaction."
- The Synthesis section read as a bulleted list rather than a true narrative synthesis.
- The "Against Many Worlds" opening was weakened by redundancy.

## Optimistic Review

### Connection Finder
- **From temporal-consciousness**: Multi-level temporal integration (micro/meso/macro) provides empirical grounding for Bergson's durée and Whitehead's prehensive inheritance. Working memory as neural correlate of specious present connects to quantum collapse timing.
- **From phenomenal-unity**: Conjoint phenomenology sharpens the combination problem—combination must produce subsumptive unity where the whole has character not derivable from parts. Quantum entanglement as physical correlate of phenomenal unity mirrors concrescence's non-separability. The emergence void concept provides vocabulary for level-transition difficulties.

### Synthesis Strengthener
- The combination problem passage needed phenomenal unity's specific analysis of what makes combination hard (conjoint phenomenology requirement).
- The article could connect durée to formal temporal unity research (micro/meso/macro levels).
- Quantum entanglement provides a physical-metaphysical bridge the article was missing.

### Human Reader Advocate
- The article reads well as philosophical prose.
- The Synthesis section needed narrative flow rather than bullet-point structure.
- Source article descriptions needed updating to reflect expanded content.

## Length Assessment

- **Before**: 3208 words
- **After**: 3386 words (+178)
- **Target range**: 2500-4000 words
- **Status**: Within range, no condensation needed

## Summary of Changes

1. **Strengthened combination problem passage** (Dualism Through Process): Integrated phenomenal unity's conjoint phenomenology analysis—combination must produce subsumptive unity where the whole has properties no part possesses. Added William James reference and connection to level-transition difficulties.

2. **Fixed "Against Many Worlds" redundancy**: Merged two repetitive opening sentences into a clean introduction.

3. **Moved haecceity paragraph** from end of Dualism section to Against Many Worlds section, where identity is the central theme. Reframed to connect process haecceitism directly to the many-worlds critique—branching would dissolve the very particularity that process haecceitism preserves.

4. **Added quantum entanglement–phenomenal unity connection** (Minimal Interaction section): Entanglement as the one physical domain with genuinely non-separable states, mirroring phenomenal unity's resistance to decomposition. Connected to process philosophy's concrescence.

5. **Narrativized Synthesis section**: Replaced bullet-pointed list with flowing prose. Integrated temporal consciousness research (nested timescales, micro/meso/macro integration levels) confirming Bergson and Whitehead. Added quantum entanglement as bidirectional bridge. Strengthened the closing paragraph on why the Map avoids the combination problem.

6. **Updated source article descriptions**: Temporal consciousness and phenomenal unity entries now reflect expanded content.
