# Deep Review: Neural Quantum Coherence

**Date**: 2026-01-19
**File**: `obsidian/concepts/neural-quantum-coherence.md`
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None identified. The article is factually accurate and well-structured.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing MRI entanglement evidence**: The Kerskens-Pérez 2022-2023 findings detecting entanglement signatures correlating with consciousness were absent from an article about 2024-2025 experimental evidence. **Resolution**: Added new "Brain Entanglement Signatures" subsection with methodology, findings, and appropriate epistemic caution about replication needs.
- **Missing twin study reference**: The 2025 twin study finding 13.5% variance explained by entanglement was absent. **Resolution**: Added "Twin Study Quantum Effects (2025)" subsection.
- **No cross-link to binding-problem.md**: The binding problem is central to why quantum coherence matters (entanglement provides genuine physical holism), yet no connection existed. **Resolution**: Added binding-problem to concepts frontmatter, wikilink in opening paragraph, and entry in Further Reading.
- **last_deep_review was null**: **Resolution**: Updated to current timestamp.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Tegmark/quantum skeptic**: The article already addresses the decoherence objection well, noting revised estimates are 7 orders of magnitude longer than original calculations.
- **Dennett/physicalist**: The article appropriately hedges that quantum effects existing doesn't prove they're relevant to consciousness ("None of this proves that quantum effects cause consciousness").
- **MWI implications**: Not addressed in this review—could be a future expansion opportunity.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear opening summary that survives truncation
- Well-organized comparison table of coherence estimates (Tegmark vs Hagan vs Fisher)
- Four protective mechanisms (hydrophobic interior, Fröhlich coherence, Fisher/Posner, ordered water) clearly explained
- Appropriate confidence calibration throughout
- Strong tenet connections in final section with all five tenets addressed

### Enhancements Made
- Updated opening paragraph to mention MRI entanglement and binding problem relevance
- Added two new experimental evidence subsections (Kerskens-Pérez MRI, Twin study)
- Added binding-problem.md to concepts and Further Reading
- Added neural-binding-quantum-entanglement-2026-01-19.md to related_articles
- Added Warren (2023) citation for methodological critique of MRI study

### Cross-links Added
- [binding-problem](/concepts/binding-problem/) (concepts, opening paragraph, Further Reading)
- [neural-binding-quantum-entanglement-2026-01-19](/research/neural-binding-quantum-entanglement-2026-01-19/) (related_articles, Further Reading)

## Remaining Items

None. The article now comprehensively covers the 2024-2025 experimental evidence including:
- Epothilone B study (already present)
- Tryptophan superradiance (already present)
- Anaesthetic-oscillation correlation (already present)
- Kerskens-Pérez MRI entanglement (newly added)
- Twin study quantum effects (newly added)

Potential future enhancement: Address Many-Worlds implications for quantum consciousness (currently not discussed).
