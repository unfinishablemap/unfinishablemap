# Deep Review: The Measurement Problem

**Date**: 2026-01-28
**File**: obsidian/concepts/measurement-problem.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-27
**Context**: Cross-review considering QBism (qbism.md now exists)
**Word count**: 2485 → 2489 (+4 words, at 100% of soft threshold)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. Previous review (2026-01-27) marked article as "high stability" which remains valid.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **QBism treatment was thin**: The QBism bullet in "The Indexical Dimension" section was only a single sentence stating QBism "brackets" the issue without engaging substantively.
   - *Resolution*: Expanded to note that QBism dissolves the measurement problem by treating quantum states as subjective beliefs, yet centres agents who must have determinate experiences—presupposing rather than explaining first-person content.

2. **Missing [qbism](/concepts/qbism/) cross-link**: The qbism.md concept now exists but wasn't linked.
   - *Resolution*: Added [qbism](/concepts/qbism/) to concepts frontmatter and linked in the indexical dimension section.

### Counterarguments Considered

All six adversarial personas engaged:
- **Eliminativist**: QBism's anti-realism about wave functions is now acknowledged—if no objective state exists, QBism "dissolves" rather than resolves the problem
- **Physicalist**: The expanded QBism treatment engages with the functionalist-adjacent view that agents' belief-updating is all there is
- **Tegmark**: No new decoherence issues; already well-addressed
- **MWI Defender**: Stable philosophical standoff maintained
- **Empiricist**: Unfalsifiability acknowledged throughout
- **Buddhist**: Haecceity section still notes conventional status as possibility

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Opening Bell quote framing
- "Honest limitation" section with explicit unfalsifiability acknowledgment
- Structural coherence defense
- Indexical dimension analysis connecting measurement and hard problems
- Sophisticated functionalist exchange
- Multi-observer coordination resolution via interface-locality
- Causal closure loophole's three features
- Structural vs. mechanistic distinction in Stapp section

### Enhancements Made

1. **QBism cross-link**: Added [qbism](/concepts/qbism/) to concepts frontmatter
2. **QBism treatment expanded**: The bullet now explains QBism's approach (belief-updating dissolves measurement problem) while noting its gap (presupposes agents with determinate experiences)
3. **Haecceity paragraph tightened**: Removed redundant parenthetical clarifications to maintain length neutrality

### Cross-links Added

- [qbism](/concepts/qbism/) — in concepts frontmatter and inline in The Indexical Dimension section

## Length Management

Article was at 2485 words (99% of soft threshold). Operated in length-neutral mode:
- Added ~24 words to QBism treatment
- Trimmed ~20 words from haecceity paragraph (removed redundant "explanatorily basic," "grounded in something further," and final clause)

Final count: 2489 words (100% of 2500 soft threshold).

## Remaining Items

None. Cross-review integration complete.

## Stability Notes

This article maintains high stability. Four consecutive reviews have found no critical issues. The QBism integration strengthens the indexical dimension section without changing the article's core arguments.

Key philosophical standoffs remain explicitly acknowledged:
- **MWI vs collapse**: Indexical argument is a philosophical disagreement, not a fixable flaw
- **Functionalist dissolution**: Article grants sophistication to functionalism while maintaining it denies rather than explains the explanandum
- **Unfalsifiability**: Explicitly acknowledged as "genuine cost"
- **QBism**: Now clearly framed as dissolving the measurement problem while presupposing (not explaining) agent experience

Future reviews should focus on: (1) new content requiring integration, (2) factual errors, (3) broken links. The article's philosophical positions are well-defended and stable.
