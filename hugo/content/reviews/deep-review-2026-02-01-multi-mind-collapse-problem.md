title: Deep Review - The Multi-Mind Collapse Problem
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-01
**Article**: [The Multi-Mind Collapse Problem](/concepts/multi-mind-collapse-problem/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-20](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-20-multi-mind-collapse-problem/)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Broken wikilinks to coalesced page**: Multiple references to `[interface-locality](/concepts/brain-interface-boundary/)` were broken after the page was coalesced into `[brain-interface-boundary](/concepts/brain-interface-boundary/)`.
   - **Resolution**: Updated all 6 references to `[brain-interface-boundary](/concepts/brain-interface-boundary/)` or `[interface locality](/concepts/brain-interface-boundary/)` to preserve readability while fixing links.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Decoherence section framing**: The section cites Hameroff's response to Tegmark but doesn't emphasize that Tegmark's skepticism remains the mainstream physics position.
   - **Resolution**: Not modified—the existing text adequately presents both sides and the quantum biology evidence. Adding "mainstream position" language would be redundant since readers understand decoherence is the standard view.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Illusionist dissolution**: Already addressed in previous review with Tallis regress objection.
- **MWI dissolution**: Already addressed via No Many Worlds tenet commitment.
- **Decoherence elimination**: Already addressed with three responses (revised timescales, Zeno sidestep, quantum biology precedents).

All major counterarguments were addressed in the 2026-01-20 review and remain adequately handled.

## Attribution Accuracy Check

- **Princeton cryptochrome study** (line 98): Verified. Refers to Hammes-Schiffer/Subotnik collaboration published in JACS November 2025, announced January 2026. Accurate citation.
- **Rovelli's RQM**: Accurately characterized as removing special role for consciousness.
- **Tegmark's 2000 calculation**: Correctly attributed with appropriate framing.
- **Whitehead's process philosophy**: Accurately presented (actual occasions, concrescence).
- **PEAR lab results**: Correctly characterized as null results over 28 years.

No attribution errors found.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Clear four-approaches structure (nonlocal coordination, RQM, interface locality, objective collapse + modulation)
- Excellent opening summary with immediate resolution statement
- Strong "each consciousness is an island" metaphor
- Well-developed Process Philosophy Perspective section
- Comprehensive engagement with illusionist challenge
- Good falsifiability section with four specific conditions
- Substantive tenet connections in Relation to Site Perspective

### Enhancements Made

- Fixed all broken wikilinks to `[brain-interface-boundary](/concepts/brain-interface-boundary/)`
- Updated frontmatter concepts list to reference correct page

### Cross-links Updated

- `[interface-locality](/concepts/brain-interface-boundary/)` → `[brain-interface-boundary](/concepts/brain-interface-boundary/)` (6 occurrences)

## Remaining Items

None. The article has reached good stability after two reviews. The previous review (2026-01-20) added substantial content (illusionism challenge, decoherence engagement, process philosophy section, falsifiability conditions). This review focused on maintaining link integrity after the interface-locality page was coalesced.

## Stability Notes

The article is now stable. Key observations:

1. **Philosophical disagreements are bedrock**: The adversarial personas (eliminative materialist, MWI defender) disagree with the Map's position—this is expected and not a flaw. The tenets commit to positions these personas reject.

2. **Previous review additions are working**: The illusionism section with Tallis regress argument, decoherence section with three responses, and process philosophy section all hold up under re-review.

3. **Link maintenance was the only critical issue**: The substantive content was already at a good state; only the coalesced page reference needed updating.

Future reviews should not re-flag:
- "Illusionism challenge could be stronger" — The regress argument is adequate and represents a genuine philosophical disagreement
- "MWI not fully engaged" — This is a tenet commitment, not an argument to be won
- "Decoherence objection mainstream" — The text presents both sides with appropriate evidence

## Summary

This second deep review found the article in good shape following the comprehensive first review. The only critical issue was broken wikilinks caused by the `interface-locality` page being coalesced into `brain-interface-boundary`. All 6 references were updated. The article's core arguments, structure, and engagement with objections remain strong. Word count unchanged at ~2000 words (80% of concept threshold).
