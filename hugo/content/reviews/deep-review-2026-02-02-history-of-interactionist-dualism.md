title: Deep Review - History of Interactionist Dualism
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Article**: [History of Interactionist Dualism](/topics/history-of-interactionist-dualism/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Duplicate name error (line 71)**: "C.D. Broad, Samuel Alexander, Charlie Dunbar Broad" listed C.D. Broad twice with different first names—they are the same person (Charlie Dunbar Broad).
   - **Resolution**: Removed duplicate, now reads "C.D. Broad and Samuel Alexander"

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Unclear Chalmers characterization (line 110-111)**: Claimed Chalmers "later expressed preference for substance dualism" without clear verification.
   - **Resolution**: Reframed to accurately describe his property dualism position and its distinction from Descartes' substance dualism

2. **PhilPapers statistic ambiguity (line 116)**: The 22% figure includes all dualists without clarifying this encompasses both property and substance dualism.
   - **Resolution**: Added parenthetical "(including both property and substance dualism)"

3. **Missing cross-link**: The measurement problem was mentioned inline but not included in Further Reading.
   - **Resolution**: Added [measurement-problem](/concepts/measurement-problem/) to Further Reading section

### Counterarguments Considered

1. **Unfalsifiability objection** (from Empiricist persona): The quantum interactionism hypothesis may be unfalsifiable if consciousness can bias quantum outcomes without detectable effects.
   - **How addressed**: This is a legitimate philosophical concern that the article acknowledges through honest epistemic uncertainty ("None of this proves interactionism true. The quantum proposals are speculative"). The article's strength is presenting interactionism as *possible*, not proven—this is appropriate given current evidence.

2. **Decoherence objection** (from Quantum Skeptic persona): Tegmark's calculations showing rapid decoherence times are not addressed.
   - **How addressed**: Deferred to linked pages ([conservation-laws-and-mind](/topics/conservation-laws-and-mind/), [stapp-quantum-mind](/concepts/stapp-quantum-mind/)). The tenets page addresses decoherence in detail. For a historical overview article, linking rather than duplicating this material is appropriate.

3. **Many-Worlds alternative** (from MWI Defender persona): The article assumes collapse is real without engaging MWI's alternative.
   - **How addressed**: The Map's tenets explicitly reject Many-Worlds (Tenet 4). This article references the tenets connection. Detailed engagement with MWI belongs in dedicated articles.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

1. **Opening paragraph**: Excellent front-loaded summary capturing the entire historical arc in a single paragraph—perfect for LLM truncation resilience
2. **Elizabeth's two-component analysis**: The distinction between conceptual and mechanism problems is analytically clear and original
3. **"The Leibniz Closure" framing**: Effective historical turning point narrative
4. **Pitts/Cucu argument**: Well-explained modern response to conservation objection
5. **"The Shape of Progress" section**: Masterful synthesis showing how successive challenges were addressed
6. **Honest epistemic uncertainty**: "None of this proves interactionism true" models good intellectual humility

### Enhancements Made

1. Added wikilink to [philosophical-zombies](/concepts/philosophical-zombies/) when discussing Chalmers' zombie argument
2. Added [measurement-problem](/concepts/measurement-problem/) to Further Reading section
3. Clarified PhilPapers survey figure to note it includes all forms of dualism

### Cross-links Added

- [philosophical-zombies](/concepts/philosophical-zombies/)
- [measurement-problem](/concepts/measurement-problem/) (to Further Reading)

## Remaining Items

None. All critical and medium issues have been addressed. The article is well-structured, historically accurate (after corrections), and appropriately connected to the site's tenets.

## Stability Notes

The adversarial personas (Eliminative Materialist, Hard-Nosed Physicalist, Quantum Skeptic, MWI Defender) raise objections that reflect genuine philosophical disagreements rather than fixable flaws in the article:

- **Unfalsifiability**: This is a legitimate concern about quantum interactionism in general, not a flaw in this historical overview
- **MWI alternative**: The Map explicitly rejects Many-Worlds as a tenet; articles need not re-argue this each time
- **Materialist progress**: The claim that neuroscience undermines dualism is contested; this is a bedrock disagreement

Future reviews should NOT re-flag these as critical issues. They represent the philosophical landscape the Map operates within, not deficiencies in the article.
