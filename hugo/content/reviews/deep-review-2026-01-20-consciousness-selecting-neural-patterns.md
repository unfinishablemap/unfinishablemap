# Deep Review: Consciousness-Selecting Neural Patterns

**Date**: 2026-01-20
**File**: obsidian/concepts/consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **No decoherence engagement**: The document never addressed the major empirical objection that warm biological systems lose quantum coherence in femtoseconds. Resolved by adding "The Decoherence Challenge" section with three responses (disputed calculations, measurement problem persists, Zeno sidestep).
- **Missing illusionist engagement**: No treatment of the eliminativist challenge. Resolved by adding "The Illusionist Challenge" section with regress problem, phenomenology of effort, and measurable effects responses.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Incomplete tenet coverage**: Only 3 of 5 tenets substantively addressed. Resolved by expanding No Many Worlds (haecceity connection) and Occam's Razor Has Limits (quantum biology precedent).
- **No process philosophy perspective**: Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section connecting Whitehead's actual occasions, decision, and concrescence to selection mechanism.
- **Missing falsifiability section**: Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section with five conditions.
- **Insufficient cross-links**: Added 6 new concept links (decoherence, illusionism, introspection, voluntary-attention, witness-consciousness, haecceity).

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Tegmark's decoherence calculations**: Addressed with Hagan et al. corrections and recent experimental evidence (2024 microtubule drugs, 2025 anaesthetic simulations)
- **Illusionist "no selector" objection**: Addressed with regress problem, phenomenology of effort, and Schwartz OCD evidence
- **Luck objection (randomness vs. selection)**: Already well-addressed in original; preserved

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear explanation of four candidate selection sites (microtubules, ion channels, microcolumns, attention networks)
- Strong empirical grounding via Meister 2024 bandwidth constraint (~10 bits/second)
- Effective "brain boundary" section explaining why selection is brain-local
- Well-organized candidate constraint families (attention-bounded, policy-level, basis-choice, indexical)
- Good treatment of selection vs. randomness via reasons-guidance, effort phenomenology, coherence over time

### Enhancements Made
- Added decoherence engagement with three-part response structure
- Added illusionist challenge section with three responses
- Added process philosophy perspective (Whitehead's concrescence as selection)
- Added comprehensive "What Would Challenge This View?" section
- Expanded tenet connections (now all 5 tenets substantively addressed)
- Added 8 new references (Tegmark, Hagan et al., Schwartz, Whitehead, etc.)

### Cross-links Added
- [decoherence](/concepts/decoherence/) - major empirical challenge
- [illusionism](/concepts/illusionism/) - eliminativist challenge
- [introspection](/concepts/introspection/) - phenomenological evidence
- [voluntary-attention](/concepts/voluntary-attention/) - neural signatures of willed selection
- [witness-consciousness](/concepts/witness-consciousness/) - contemplative evidence
- [haecceity](/concepts/haecceity/) - indexical identity and selection

## Remaining Items

None. All critical and medium issues addressed. Document now meets current deep-review standards with comprehensive challenge sections, process philosophy perspective, and full tenet coverage.
