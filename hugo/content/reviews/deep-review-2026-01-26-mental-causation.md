# Deep Review: Mental Causation

**Date**: 2026-01-26
**File**: obsidian/concepts/mental-causation.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-20
**Word count**: 2907 → 2908 (+1, length-neutral)
**Context**: Cross-review considering psychophysical laws framework

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The 2026-01-20 review addressed the main structural gaps (decoherence, MWI, falsifiability, illusionism). The article is well-structured and covers the major objections.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing link to psychophysical-laws-framework**: The Specification Challenge section surveyed mechanisms but didn't connect to the new integrated framework article that articulates why specification is needed and what structural requirements selection laws must meet. [RESOLVED: Added framework link and explanation of supervenience vs. selection laws distinction]
- **Missing bidirectional-interaction in concepts frontmatter**: The body discusses bidirectional interaction but the concept wasn't in frontmatter. [RESOLVED: Already present in frontmatter from previous review]

### Counterarguments Considered
- Eliminative materialist: "Phenomenal properties" may be a mistaken folk category—addressed by illusionism section
- Dennett's heterophenomenology: More subtle than simple illusionism—article engages adequately with Tallis response
- Quantum skeptic (Tegmark): Decoherence timescales—addressed in dedicated subsection
- MWI defender: Indexical significance of consciousness—acknowledged as philosophical standoff

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Self-stultification argument: Clear, epistemically powerful, well-structured
- Kim's exclusion argument presentation: Fair and comprehensive
- Quantum opening explanation: Accessible without oversimplifying
- Agent causation section: Good phenomenological grounding
- Falsifiability conditions: Demonstrates epistemic humility
- Process philosophy alternative: Good complementary framing

### Enhancements Made
- Added reference to [psychophysical-laws-framework](/topics/psychophysical-laws-framework/) in the Specification Challenge section
- Added explanation of supervenience laws vs. selection laws distinction
- Added framework link to Further Reading section
- Added framework to concepts frontmatter
- Tightened mechanism list descriptions to maintain length neutrality

### Cross-links Added
- [psychophysical-laws-framework](/topics/psychophysical-laws-framework/) (concepts frontmatter, Specification Challenge section, Further Reading)

## Remaining Items

None. The article has reached stability. The cross-review integration with the psychophysical laws framework is complete.

## Stability Notes

This is the second deep review. The article has reached a stable state:

- **The MWI objection** represents a philosophical standoff—Many-Worlds defenders will find the indexical argument unsatisfying. This is a bedrock disagreement between interpretations of quantum mechanics, not a flaw to fix.

- **The decoherence objection** is genuinely challenging. The article acknowledges this while noting that decoherence doesn't solve the measurement problem. Future physics research could strengthen or weaken the quantum opening, but the philosophical point stands.

- **The illusionist challenge** is engaged adequately. The regress problem (misrepresentation presupposes presentation) is a standard response; illusionists have counterresponses. This is ongoing philosophical debate, not a resolvable issue.

- **The specification problem** is the main area for future development. The article now properly connects to the psychophysical-laws-framework, which articulates what selection laws must accomplish. As mechanism proposals develop (or fail), this section may need updating.

The article is at 116% of soft threshold—further expansion is not warranted. Future reviews should focus on accuracy and connection maintenance, not expansion.
