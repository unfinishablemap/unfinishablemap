title: Deep Review - Spontaneous Intentional Action
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-17
**Article**: [Spontaneous Intentional Action](/concepts/spontaneous-intentional-action/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Broken links to archived articles**: `[voluntary-attention](/voluntary-attention/)` and `[duration](/duration/)` both archived (replaced by `[attention-as-interface](/concepts/attention-as-interface/)` and `[temporal-consciousness](/concepts/temporal-consciousness/)`). Updated all frontmatter and body links.
- **Missing `last_deep_review` field**: Added to frontmatter.
- **`[volitional-opacity](/voids/volitional-opacity/)` categorisation**: Listed under `concepts:` in frontmatter but exists as a void. Kept in `concepts:` list since the frontmatter schema doesn't have a `voids:` field and wikilinks resolve regardless of path. Noted for potential schema improvement.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Unused references (Frankfurt, Pacherie)**: Removed. They were in References but never cited in body text.
- **Dreyfus and Searle uncited in body**: Now cited explicitly — Dreyfus in "Contextual fit" subsection for embodied expertise, Searle in "Not deliberate" for the prior intention / intention-in-action distinction.
- **No engagement with luck objection**: Added paragraph in "For the Selection Framework" section addressing how agent-causation and accumulated character distinguish spontaneous selection from randomness.
- **Missing Libet/Wegner engagement**: Added paragraph in "Against Determinism" section explaining why spontaneous intentional actions are a counterexample to confabulation theories.
- **Bergson's durée undefined**: Added inline definition ("lived qualitative time") at first use.
- **Tenet 5 (Occam's Razor) missing from Relation to Site Perspective**: Added paragraph connecting the simplicity objection to the phenomenological data that spontaneous intentional action makes salient.
- **Contemplative section Zen claims unreferenced**: Added Suzuki (1959) for mushin concept and Lutz et al. (2008) for contemplative phenomenology.
- **Motor selection unlisted in body**: Added reference in "The Category" section explaining the neural pre-narrowing of options.
- **Contemplative "endorsement" tension with "no deliberation"**: Clarified that endorsement is not deliberation in the ordinary sense (no weighing of alternatives) but the selection mechanism operating transparently.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Churchland (eliminative materialist)**: Folk-psychological concepts like "authorship" and "ownership" may not survive neuroscientific maturation. *Not addressed directly* — this is a bedrock disagreement between the Map's dualist framework and eliminativism. The article's phenomenological descriptions are intentionally first-person rather than neuroscientific.
- **Dennett (physicalist)**: The category may be phenomenologically drawn rather than empirically grounded; authorship sense could be retrospective confabulation. *Addressed* by adding the Wegner/Libet counterargument paragraph.
- **Tegmark (quantum skeptic)**: Decoherence objection not discussed in the article itself. *Deferred* — the article appropriately delegates decoherence discussion to the tenets and quantum-consciousness articles rather than repeating it.
- **Deutsch (MWI defender)**: Phenomenology of singular actualisation is predicted by MWI too. *Not addressed* — this is a bedrock disagreement; the No Many Worlds tenet is asserted, not argued in every article.
- **Popper (empiricist)**: No positive empirical predictions offered. *Partially addressed* — the "What Would Challenge This View?" section specifies falsifiers, and the Libet discussion engages empirical evidence.
- **Nagarjuna (Buddhist)**: The self-as-author may be empty; mushin implies no-self, not dualist effortless agency. *Not addressed directly* — this is acknowledged as a genuine tension between the Map's agent-causal framework and Buddhist metaphysics. The article uses Zen phenomenology while operating within a different metaphysical framework, which is legitimate.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening paragraph with three vivid concrete examples (reaching, speaking, hawk-watching)
- Four-fold negative definition ("The Category" section) — methodologically exemplary
- "Effort tracks difficulty of selection, not presence of selection" — key thesis sentence
- Bergson passage on depth: "The action is intelligent because it is *deep*"
- Bidirectional interaction argument against epiphenomenalism
- "Prepared without being planned" formulation
- "What Would Challenge This View?" section — intellectual honesty

### Enhancements Made
- Added cross-links to [phenomenology-of-flow-states](/topics/phenomenology-of-flow-states/), [paradox-of-effortless-mastery](/topics/paradox-of-effortless-mastery/), [interface-friction](/concepts/interface-friction/), [libet-experiments](/concepts/libet-experiments/), [reasons-responsiveness](/concepts/reasons-responsiveness/)
- Strengthened "Against Determinism" with Libet/Wegner engagement
- Added luck objection engagement with cross-reference to agent-causation
- Added motor-selection reference grounding the neural mechanism
- Connected contemplative section to paradox of effortless mastery
- Added Dreyfus citation for embodied expertise claims
- Added Searle's intention-in-action / prior intention distinction
- Connected all five tenets in Relation to Site Perspective (was missing Occam's Razor)
- Updated archived links to current replacement articles

### Cross-links Added
- [phenomenology-of-flow-states](/topics/phenomenology-of-flow-states/)
- [paradox-of-effortless-mastery](/topics/paradox-of-effortless-mastery/)
- [interface-friction](/concepts/interface-friction/)
- [libet-experiments](/concepts/libet-experiments/)
- [reasons-responsiveness](/concepts/reasons-responsiveness/)
- [attention-as-interface](/concepts/attention-as-interface/) (replacing archived [voluntary-attention](/voluntary-attention/))
- [temporal-consciousness](/concepts/temporal-consciousness/) (replacing archived [duration](/duration/))
- [motor-selection](/concepts/motor-selection/) (was in frontmatter only, now in body)

## Remaining Items

- The Buddhist/Nagarjuna tension with agent-causation is genuine and could be developed in a future article connecting Madhyamaka emptiness with dualist agency frameworks.
- The developmental angle (how spontaneous intentional action develops in children) is an expansion opportunity if the article needs more depth in future.
- Somatic markers / bodily phenomenology of spontaneous action could enrich the phenomenological profile.

## Stability Notes

- The adversarial personas' disagreements with dualism, agent-causation, and the rejection of MWI are bedrock philosophical standoffs, not fixable issues. Future reviews should NOT re-flag "eliminativists reject folk-psychological categories" or "MWI explains singular phenomenology too" as critical.
- The tension between Buddhist no-self and dualist agent-causation is acknowledged. The article uses Zen phenomenology within a different metaphysical framework — this is a legitimate philosophical move, not a conflation.
- The decoherence objection is intentionally not discussed in this article; it is covered in the tenets and quantum-consciousness articles. This is appropriate delegation, not an omission to fix.
