title: Deep Review - Consciousness and Information Integration Beyond IIT
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-22
**Article**: [Consciousness and Information Integration Beyond IIT](/topics/consciousness-and-information-integration-beyond-iit/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Archived concept reference**: `phenomenal-unity` in frontmatter concepts was archived (superseded by `phenomenal-binding-and-holism`, already listed). Removed the broken reference.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Tenet 4 omitted**: Relation to Site Perspective discussed quantum selection but did not address the No Many Worlds tenet. Added a paragraph connecting MWI rejection to the activity thesis's requirement for genuine quantum selection.
- **IIT Φ oversimplified**: Claimed "Φ is calculated from the system's architecture at an instant." IIT 4.0 computes Φ over the system's current state. Corrected to acknowledge state-dependence while preserving the argument that Φ reflects intrinsic causal structure rather than subjective activity.
- **Quantum claims underhedged**: Quantum selection presented matter-of-factly without speculative qualification. Added explicit hedging ("as the Map speculatively proposes") and acknowledged the decoherence challenge as an open empirical question.
- **Simultanagnosia uncited**: Example lacked a reference. Added Coslett & Saffran (1991).

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Decoherence objection** (Tegmark): Acknowledged directly in the text — decoherence timescales are extremely short in warm biological tissue, and whether quantum coherence persists long enough is open. The conceptual argument for integration-as-activity is framed as mechanism-independent.
- **Many-Worlds objection** (Deutsch): If all quantum branches are realised, selection is illusory. Addressed via new Tenet 4 paragraph in Relation to Site Perspective.
- **Homunculus objection** (Dennett): "Who does the selecting?" Not directly addressed in text — this is a bedrock disagreement between dualists and physicalists that runs through the Map's entire framework, not specific to this article.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Core identity-vs-activity distinction: the article's original philosophical contribution
- Symphony listening example: excellent phenomenological illustration of selective integration
- Consistent framework survey structure (describe → compare → note limitation)
- Binding problem reframing: genuine insight about mechanism vs. metaphysics
- Strong opening paragraph that front-loads the key claim
- Clean source/Map separation throughout

### Enhancements Made
- Added Tenet 4 (No Many Worlds) to Relation to Site Perspective
- Corrected IIT 4.0 characterisation (state-dependent, not just architecture)
- Added speculative hedging to quantum selection claims
- Acknowledged decoherence challenge explicitly
- Added simultanagnosia citation
- Removed archived `phenomenal-unity` from frontmatter

### Cross-links Added
- None new (existing cross-links were comprehensive; removed broken `phenomenal-unity` reference)

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues were addressed in this review.

## Stability Notes

- The eliminative materialist and hard-nosed physicalist objections (consciousness-as-homunculus, question-begging against physicalism) are bedrock disagreements inherent to the Map's dualist framework. These should not be re-flagged as critical in future reviews.
- The Buddhist concern about reifying consciousness as a "selecting agent" is a legitimate philosophical tension but is intrinsic to any interactionist dualist position. Future reviews should not treat this as a fixable flaw.
- The decoherence challenge is now acknowledged explicitly. Future reviews should not re-flag it unless new empirical evidence changes the landscape significantly.
