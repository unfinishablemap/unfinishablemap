**Date**: 2026-02-06
**Article**: [Cognitive Science of Dualism](/topics/cognitive-science-of-dualism/)
**Previous review**: [2026-02-05](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-05-cognitive-science-of-dualism/)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The previous review found no critical issues and addressed 7 medium issues (behavioral-output rebuttal, vitalism distinction, Friston qualification, IIT/GWT acknowledgment, quantum timescale conditioning, radio waves analogy qualification, embodied robot softening). All corrections remain sound. No new factual errors, misattributions, or internal contradictions detected.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Article orphaned with zero inbound links**: The article had no inbound cross-references from any other site content despite being thematically central to multiple concept and topic pages. **Resolution**: Added 9 cross-references from existing articles (see Cross-links Added below).

2. **Further Reading missing discussed topics**: Neural correlates of consciousness, predictive processing, and neurophenomenology are all discussed in the article but were absent from Further Reading. **Resolution**: Added [neural-correlates-of-consciousness](/concepts/neural-correlates-of-consciousness/), [predictive-processing](/concepts/predictive-processing/), and [neurophenomenology](/concepts/neurophenomenology/) to Further Reading.

### Counterarguments Considered

No new counterarguments beyond those already addressed in the previous review. The article's defenses against the behavioral-output objection, vitalism parallel, and unfalsifiability concern remain adequate.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- The methodological circle argument — the article's most original contribution
- The thermometer analogy — compact, memorable, precisely calibrated
- The genetic fallacy symmetry argument — logically rigorous, rhetorically effective
- The embodied cognition jiu-jitsu move — turning a materialist argument into support for dualism
- The "yes, but" rhetorical structure throughout — builds credibility
- The opening summary — front-loads the core claim effectively

### Enhancements Made

- Added 3 entries to Further Reading: [neural-correlates-of-consciousness](/concepts/neural-correlates-of-consciousness/), [predictive-processing](/concepts/predictive-processing/), [neurophenomenology](/concepts/neurophenomenology/)
- Updated frontmatter timestamps

### Cross-links Added (from other articles → this article)

This was the primary focus of the review. Nine inbound cross-references added:

1. **[arguments-for-dualism](/arguments-for-dualism/)** — In "The Folk Error Objection" section, added link alongside [intuitive-dualism](/concepts/intuitive-dualism/)
2. **[first-person-third-person-methodology](/topics/first-person-third-person-methodology/)** — In "The Methodological Problem" section, referencing the methodological circle argument
3. **[phenomenology](/concepts/phenomenology/)** — In "First-Person Irreducibility" section, linking the mention of empirically widespread intuitive dualism
4. **[explanatory-gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/)** — In "From Epistemic to Ontological" section, connecting the methodological circle to the gap's persistence
5. **[cognitive-closure](/concepts/cognitive-closure/)** — In "Why the Mind-Body Problem?" section, noting how asymmetric access shapes cognitive science
6. **[hard-problem-of-consciousness](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/)** — In "Relation to the Map's Perspective" section, adding empirical support
7. **[neural-correlates-of-consciousness](/concepts/neural-correlates-of-consciousness/)** — In "The Philosophical Boundary" section, noting the first-person report dependency
8. **[predictive-processing](/concepts/predictive-processing/)** — In "Does PP Solve the Hard Problem?" section, connecting to the broader cognitive science limitation
9. **[embodied-cognition](/concepts/embodied-cognition/)** — In "Compatibility with Filter Theory" section, referencing the functional integration puzzle

## Remaining Items

- **Libet experiments / voluntary action**: Would strengthen the Bidirectional Interaction tenet connection but represents significant expansion. Deferred from previous review; still not critical.
- **Meta-problem of consciousness**: Chalmers's 2018 argument would enrich the genetic fallacy section. Not essential.
- **intuitive-dualism.md already links to this article**: Confirmed — it contains "See [cognitive-science-of-dualism](/topics/cognitive-science-of-dualism/)" already.

## Stability Notes

- The article reached stability after the first deep review. This second review found no critical or medium content issues — the only substantive work was orphan integration (adding inbound cross-references from 9 articles).
- The six adversarial personas' philosophical disagreements remain bedrock standoffs (eliminative materialists reject the methodological circle; empiricists want falsification; Dennett denies the embodied robot intuition). These are not fixable and should not be re-flagged.
- The heliocentrism comparison remains contestable but suggestive — this is acknowledged in the article and is acceptable.
- Future reviews should focus on verifying that the 9 new cross-references remain intact and contextually appropriate, not on re-reviewing the article's stable content.
