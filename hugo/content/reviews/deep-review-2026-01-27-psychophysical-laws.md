title: Deep Review - Psychophysical Laws
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-01-27
**Article**: [Psychophysical Laws](/concepts/psychophysical-laws/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-26](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-26-psychophysical-laws/)
**Context**: Cross-review considering chalmers-psychophysical-coupling insights

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Six adversarial personas evaluated the article with particular attention to consistency with the newly created chalmers-psychophysical-coupling.md article.

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article has all required sections, no factual errors, no internal contradictions. Previous review (2026-01-26) addressed all critical issues.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Missing cross-reference to new Chalmers article**: The new dedicated article on Chalmers' framework (chalmers-psychophysical-coupling.md) provides focused treatment that should be referenced.
   - **Resolution**: Added cross-link in opening paragraph, related_articles, and Further Reading.

2. **Haecceity argument underdeveloped compared to new article**: The chalmers-psychophysical-coupling article developed the zombie-conceivability connection more fully.
   - **Resolution**: Strengthened the haecceity argument in the organizational invariance section by connecting it to the zombie argument's deeper logic.

### Counterarguments Considered
- Previous review (2026-01-26) addressed Dennett's phenomenology objection and Tegmark's decoherence objection. No new counterarguments identified.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

Six sympathetic personas evaluated the article's strengths and cross-linking opportunities.

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear supervenience vs. causal laws distinction (unique to this concept article)
- Chalmers' three principles explained in depth
- Process philosophy section provides distinctive Whiteheadian framework (not duplicated in new article)
- Contemplative evidence section with witness consciousness, mental effort, quiet mind (unique)
- Illusionist challenge with regress response
- Strong tenet connections covering all five tenets

### Enhancements Made
1. **Cross-references to chalmers-psychophysical-coupling**: Added in opening, related_articles, and Further Reading
2. **Strengthened haecceity argument**: Connected to zombie conceivability per the new article's stronger formulation
3. **Condensed haecceity section**: Reduced redundancy by linking to the new article's fuller treatment

### Cross-links Added
- [chalmers-psychophysical-coupling](/chalmers-psychophysical-coupling/) (opening paragraph, related_articles, Further Reading)

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues were addressed.

## Word Count

- Before: 3180 words (127% of 2500 threshold)
- After: 3193 words (128% of 2500 threshold)
- Change: +13 words (haecceity argument strengthened, later section condensed)

Article remains above soft threshold but within acceptable range. The changes were length-neutral as required.

## Stability Notes

This is the second deep review in two days. The article has reached stability:

- **Core content unchanged**: The unique sections (process philosophy, contemplative evidence, illusionist challenge) remain valuable and don't duplicate the new Chalmers article
- **Cross-linking established**: The concept article now properly references the dedicated Chalmers treatment
- **No oscillation**: Changes strengthen arguments identified as weak, don't reverse previous decisions

The following represent fundamental philosophical disagreements rather than fixable problems:
- **Eliminativist critique**: The article presupposes the hard problem is genuine (Map tenet)
- **MWI proponent critique**: Rejection of many-worlds is a tenet-level commitment
- **Phenomenology skepticism**: The Map holds first-person evidence is indispensable (bedrock disagreement)

Future reviews should focus on new content integration rather than re-examining these settled points.
