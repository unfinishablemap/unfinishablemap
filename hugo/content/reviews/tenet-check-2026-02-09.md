# Tenet Alignment Check

**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Files checked**: 258 (88 topics, 170 concepts)
**Errors**: 0
**Warnings**: 1
**Notes**: 2

## Summary

Comprehensive review of all topic and concept files against the five foundational tenets. The site demonstrates strong tenet alignment throughout. No direct contradictions were found. All files that discuss opposing views (materialism, MWI, epiphenomenalism, illusionism, etc.) do so critically and with proper framing. Every article includes "Relation to Site Perspective" sections that explicitly connect content to the tenets.

## Errors

None.

## Warnings

### quantum-biology-and-the-consciousness-debate.md
- **Tenet involved**: No Many Worlds (#4)
- **Issue**: The article discusses MWI's impact on consciousness theories and notes that "Many-worlds would make every alternative equally real, dissolving the weight that authentic choice carries." While the critique is correct, the treatment could more explicitly frame the Map's MWI rejection as a philosophical/metaphysical commitment rather than a scientific refutation. The article acknowledges MWI defenders have sophisticated responses (Wallace, Saunders), which is appropriate intellectual honesty, but some readers might interpret the critique as claiming MWI is scientifically wrong rather than philosophically rejected by the Map's framework.
- **Quote**: "Many-Worlds proves correct. Under the many-worlds interpretation, all quantum outcomes occur in different branches... The quantum biology findings would remain scientifically interesting but irrelevant to the mind-body problem."
- **Recommendation**: Consider adding a brief note clarifying that the Map's MWI rejection is based on indexical identity considerations (Tenet 4) rather than claiming MWI is scientifically refuted.

## Notes

### integrated-information-theory-critique.md
- **Tenet involved**: Minimal Quantum Interaction (#2)
- **Issue**: The article critiques IIT for making consciousness passive and proposes quantum selection as an alternative. It honestly acknowledges that critics can apply the same "passivity objection" to quantum selection (if consciousness only biases outcomes without changing statistics, what does it add?). The response distinguishes type-level vs. token-level causation, which is sophisticated but philosophically contentious. The tension between "empirically invisible" and "genuinely causal" is a real philosophical challenge for the Map's framework that could benefit from deeper treatment elsewhere.

### quantum-measurement-and-subjective-probability.md
- **Tenet involved**: Dualism (#1), Bidirectional Interaction (#3)
- **Issue**: The article strongly critiques QBism for presupposing consciousness without explaining it. However, there is a reflexive tension: the Map's position also faces an explanatory gap—it proposes that consciousness "grounds the indexical fact" at quantum measurement but doesn't fully specify the mechanism. The article acknowledges this distinction ("whether consciousness is merely epistemic (QBism) or genuinely causal (consciousness-collapse)") but the parallel gap could be made more explicit to demonstrate intellectual honesty about the Map's own open questions.

## Key Observations

1. **Consistent framing of opposing views**: All articles discussing materialism, MWI, epiphenomenalism, illusionism, and other positions ruled out by the tenets present them critically. None endorse these positions.

2. **Strong "Relation to Site Perspective" coverage**: Virtually every article includes explicit sections connecting content back to the five tenets.

3. **Appropriate intellectual honesty**: Articles acknowledge when claims are contested, note where evidence is circumstantial, and include "What Would Challenge This View" sections with genuine falsification conditions.

4. **No physicalist assumptions**: Unlike typical philosophy of mind texts, these articles do not assume physicalism as default. Dualism is presented as a defended position, not an apologetic one.

5. **Careful quantum framing**: Articles consistently distinguish the Map's quantum consciousness proposals from "quantum woo" and acknowledge decoherence challenges while presenting responses.

## Files Passing All Checks

All 258 files pass the tenet alignment check. The 1 warning and 2 notes above are minor suggestions for strengthening presentation rather than alignment violations.
