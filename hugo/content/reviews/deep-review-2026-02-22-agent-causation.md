title: Deep Review - Agent Causation
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-22
**Article**: [Agent Causation](/concepts/agent-causation/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-20](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-20-agent-causation/)
**Cross-review context**: [Voluntary Attention Control Mechanisms](/concepts/voluntary-attention-control-mechanisms/) (new article)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None. Article is well-structured with accurate attributions and proper source/Map separation.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Stale frontmatter link**: `[voluntary-attention](/concepts/attention-as-interface/)` pointed to an archived article (coalesced into attention-as-interface). [Resolution: Updated to `[voluntary-attention-control-mechanisms](/concepts/voluntary-attention-control-mechanisms/)`]
- **Missing cross-link to new article**: The "Voluntary Attention" section lacked reference to the new `voluntary-attention-control-mechanisms` article, which provides detailed mechanistic grounding (salience network, thalamic gating, three-component framework). [Resolution: Added cross-link with brief mechanism summary]
- **Neural claims lacked inline citation**: Timing and spectral claims (~300ms, frontal theta, bidirectional coherence) had no direct citation in this article. [Resolution: Added Rajan et al. 2019 and Nadra & Mangun 2023 inline and in References]

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist**: Choking-under-pressure shows neural process interference, not substance causation. [Bedrock disagreement with dualism — not re-flagged per previous review]
- **Dennettian**: Libet resolution presupposes consciousness is separate from neural activity. [Philosophical standoff — not re-flagged]
- **Quantum skeptic**: ~300ms attention timescale vs. quantum coherence timescales. [Article's position — consciousness biases at decoherence — is stated but could be clearer. Not critical.]
- **Buddhist philosopher**: What grounds the persisting substance? [Addressed through Whitehead section. Foundational disagreement from previous review.]

### Attribution Accuracy
- All philosopher attributions verified: Lowe, Chisholm, Kane, Mele, Hasker, Schurger, Sjöberg, Desmurget, Hausman
- No misattributions, dropped qualifiers, or source/Map conflation found
- Kane 2024 convergence described as Map interpretation, not Kane's framing — appropriate

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Substance causation foundation (Lowe's framework) — strongest philosophical argument on site
- Two-domain convergence argument (attention + motor selection)
- Creative generation section (beyond selection — genuine novelty)
- Skill delegation and choking phenomenon empirical evidence
- Falsifiability section with six testable conditions
- Whitehead reframing: "Why did we think it couldn't?"
- Clean source/Map separation throughout

### Enhancements Made
1. **Cross-link to voluntary-attention-control-mechanisms**: Added reference to salience network switching, thalamic gating, and frontal decision circuits as specific candidate sites for agent-causal intervention
2. **Inline citations added**: Rajan et al. 2019 and Nadra & Mangun 2023 now cited directly for willed/instructed attention claims
3. **Stale link fixed**: `[voluntary-attention](/concepts/attention-as-interface/)` → `[voluntary-attention-control-mechanisms](/concepts/voluntary-attention-control-mechanisms/)` in frontmatter

### Cross-links Added
- [voluntary-attention-control-mechanisms](/concepts/voluntary-attention-control-mechanisms/) (frontmatter concepts + Further Reading + inline)

### References Added
- Nadra, J.G. & Mangun, G.R. (2023). Placing willed attention in context. *Frontiers in Cognition*.
- Rajan, A. et al. (2019). Theta oscillations index frontal decision-making. *Cerebral Cortex*.

## Length Analysis

- Before: 3142 words (126% of 2500 soft threshold)
- After: 3209 words (128% of 2500 soft threshold)
- Net change: +67 words (body content roughly neutral; increase from two added references)
- Length-neutral mode applied: removed attentional-economics tangent and trailing cross-reference to offset mechanistic addition

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues addressed.

## Stability Notes

This article has reached good stability after two reviews. The previous review (2026-01-20) added falsifiability, decoherence challenge, process philosophy, and several cross-links. This review's changes were targeted: fixing a stale link, adding a cross-link to a newly created article, and improving citation coverage. The philosophical disagreements (eliminativism, Dennettian physicalism, Buddhist non-self) are bedrock standoffs that future reviews should not re-flag. The article's substance causation framework is its core contribution and is well-developed. Future reviews should focus on factual accuracy and cross-linking rather than structural changes.
