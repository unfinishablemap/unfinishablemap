title: Deep Review - Attentional Economics
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Article**: [Attentional Economics](/concepts/attentional-economics/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-31](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-31-attentional-economics/)

## Context

This review was triggered because attentional-economics.md had **zero inbound links** despite being highly relevant to many core concepts. The primary task was to integrate the orphaned content into site navigation through cross-references from existing articles.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None identified. The article remains well-constructed with appropriate hedging on speculative mechanisms and accurate tenet connections. The previous review (2026-01-31) addressed all identified issues.

### Medium Issues Found
None new. The Zeno hedging noted by the quantum skeptic persona is already adequately handled with "if it's the mechanism" phrasing.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Churchland/Dennett (functionalist)**: Felt effort could be explained by neural competition alone. The article engages this via the argument from reason—bedrock philosophical disagreement.
- **Tegmark (quantum skeptic)**: Decoherence objections apply. Appropriately hedged.
- **MWI defender**: Selection might be indexical even under MWI. Brief but adequate response.
- **Buddhist philosopher**: Reifies attention and attentional agent. Philosophical difference reflecting the Map's dualist commitments.

All represent expected philosophical standoffs rather than fixable problems.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Novel reframing of agency (sustained attention allocation over time)
- Economic table mapping (scarcity, allocation, investment, return, opportunity cost)
- Four-element phenomenological analysis (felt alternatives, selection effort, opportunity awareness, investment temporality)
- Three-level structure (selection, witness mode, meta-level agency)
- Appropriate hedging on quantum mechanisms
- Moral responsibility nuances (scaling, cultivation, structural factors)

### Enhancements Made
No changes to the article content itself—the article is stable and well-developed.

### Cross-links Added (from other articles)
The primary contribution of this review was adding inbound links from 8 related articles:

1. **agent-causation.md** — Added link in "Voluntary Attention as Agent-Causal Paradigm" section, connecting attentional economics as the economic framework for agent causation
2. **mental-effort.md** — Added link in opening section, connecting effort phenomenology to the broader attentional economics framework
3. **voluntary-attention.md** — Added link in temporal profile section, explaining deployment time as "investment" of attentional capital
4. **moral-responsibility.md** — Added link in character responsibility section, connecting attentional skill development to moral authorship
5. **meditation-and-consciousness-modes.md** — Added link in FA meditation section, interpreting meditation training as building "attentional capital"
6. **free-will.md** — Added link after phenomenology-of-effort discussion, connecting effort to the broader economic framework
7. **working-memory.md** — Added link in bandwidth constraint section, interpreting WM capacity as "attentional capital"
8. **phenomenology-of-choice.md** — Added link in choosing-vs-observing section, explaining choice as resource allocation

## Remaining Items

None. The article is in good shape and is now properly integrated into the site's navigation structure through 8 new inbound links.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed twice. The previous review found no critical issues; this review confirms stability. The article represents a mature integration of the Map's framework applied to agency and attention.

**Bedrock disagreements** (do not re-flag as critical in future reviews):
- Functionalist alternative explanations for effort phenomenology
- MWI defender's indexical response
- Buddhist critique of reified attention/agent

The article is stable and well-integrated. Future reviews should focus on checking for new content that might benefit from cross-linking rather than seeking changes to the article itself.
