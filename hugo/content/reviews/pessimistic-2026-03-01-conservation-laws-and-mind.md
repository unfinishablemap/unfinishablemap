# Pessimistic Review

**Date**: 2026-03-01
**Content reviewed**: obsidian/topics/conservation-laws-and-mind.md

## Executive Summary

This article mounts a sophisticated defence of mental causation against the energy conservation objection, drawing on Pitts and Cucu's work to argue conservation is local and conditional. However, the "selection not injection" framework contains a critical equivocation between two senses of "causation without energy"—the boundary-condition sense (which is uncontroversial but doesn't help dualism) and the consciousness-as-selector sense (which would help dualism but lacks physical grounding). The article is admirably honest about its limits in some places while quietly eliding them in others.

## Critiques by Philosopher

### The Eliminative Materialist

Patricia Churchland would regard this article as an elaborate effort to preserve folk-psychological categories that neuroscience is steadily dissolving. The entire edifice rests on treating "consciousness" as a discrete causal agent that can "select" among quantum outcomes—but this presupposes exactly the kind of unified, substantial mental causation that neuroscience finds no evidence for. We don't find a single locus of conscious selection in the brain; we find distributed, competing neural processes.

The article claims consciousness "biases which outcome actualizes" without explaining what consciousness *is* in physical terms—because it can't, being committed to irreducibility. But an irreducible selector acting on physical systems is just a homunculus with extra steps. When the article says "the mind selects," what exactly is doing the selecting? The article never provides an answer beyond restating its conclusion.

### The Hard-Nosed Physicalist

Dennett would admire the article's intellectual honesty in the "Any Selection Mechanism Would Be Detectable" section, then argue the honesty should have gone further. The entire "selection not injection" framework is built on inflating a genuine puzzle (the measurement problem) into a metaphysical opening for consciousness. But the measurement problem is a problem about our *understanding* of quantum mechanics, not necessarily a gap in physical causation.

The article repeatedly conflates "physics doesn't explain X" with "physics leaves room for a non-physical explanation of X." But the history of science is littered with gaps that turned out to be gaps in knowledge, not gaps in nature. The article's consciousness-of-the-gaps reasoning is dressed up in the language of Noether's theorem, but the underlying move is the same: find something physics doesn't fully explain, insert consciousness.

The article says the conservation objection "begs the question" by assuming no external influences exist. But turning this around: the article begs the question by assuming consciousness *is* an external influence requiring a gap in physics. The charge of question-begging goes both directions.

### The Quantum Skeptic

Tegmark would press three specific objections:

**First**, the claim that "selecting among energetically equivalent outcomes requires no energy transfer" is stated without mathematical demonstration. The Born rule gives probabilities, and any systematic deviation from Born-rule predictions—however small—would be detectable in principle. If consciousness biases outcomes, it alters probabilities. If it alters probabilities, it violates the Born rule. If it violates the Born rule, it's empirically testable. The article simultaneously claims consciousness acts at measurement and that this action is undetectable. These claims are in tension.

**Second**, the article treats "quantum-permitted outcomes" as if they exist in a well-defined menu from which consciousness selects. But in the density matrix formalism after decoherence, what remains is a classical probability distribution over outcomes determined by the initial state and Hamiltonian. There is no "menu" awaiting a selector—there is a probability distribution that, on the standard interpretation, simply yields outcomes stochastically. The metaphor of "selection" smuggles in agency where the mathematics describes statistics.

**Third**, the decoherence section is too brief for the weight it must bear. Hagan et al.'s seven-orders-of-magnitude challenge to Tegmark's calculations has not been widely accepted in the physics community. The article mentions it as if it were a peer-reviewed rebuttal of comparable standing to the original calculation, but the disputed model parameters are themselves disputed. The physics community's consensus remains closer to Tegmark's estimates.

### The Many-Worlds Defender

Deutsch would argue the article's dismissal of MWI in the "Many-Worlds Eliminates the Problem" section is perfunctory. The article says "The Map rejects MWI for independent reasons" and links to the tenets, but this is not an argument—it's a policy statement. The MWI objection is treated as a background assumption to be noted and moved past, not a genuine challenge to be engaged.

More fundamentally, Deutsch would point out that the article's reliance on "collapse" as the site where consciousness acts is itself philosophically contested. The article assumes collapse is real—a non-trivial metaphysical commitment—and builds its entire framework on that assumption. But MWI's strength is precisely that it doesn't require collapse at all; it's just the Schrödinger equation applied consistently. The article's framework is hostage to the interpretation of quantum mechanics it presupposes.

The claim that MWI "proliferates unobservable branches" misses Deutsch's point: the branches aren't postulated—they follow mathematically from unitary evolution. Collapse, on the other hand, *is* postulated. Which view is more parsimonious?

### The Empiricist

A Popperian would find the "Any Selection Mechanism Would Be Detectable" section the most revealing part of the article. The article admits: "If consciousness selects among outcomes in ways that are (1) rare, (2) small in magnitude, or (3) variable across individuals and contexts, the effect might fall below experimental sensitivity."

This is a textbook immunising strategy. When a theory's predictions are indistinguishable from those of the null hypothesis, the theory is empirically vacuous. The article acknowledges this: "A theory that predicts undetectable effects risks being unfalsifiable." But then it continues arguing for the framework rather than abandoning it or proposing specific testable predictions.

The article's own "What Conservation Cannot Prove" section argues that the conservation debate is really about causal closure, a "metaphysical thesis that cannot be established by physics alone." But if the thesis can't be established *or* refuted by physics, it's metaphysics, not science. The article repeatedly crosses the border between philosophy and physics when it's convenient—invoking Noether's theorem and the Standard Model for credibility, then retreating to "metaphysical" when falsifiability is demanded.

What specific experiment would distinguish worlds where consciousness biases quantum outcomes from worlds where quantum outcomes are purely stochastic? The article doesn't say.

### The Buddhist Philosopher

Nagarjuna would question the article's unexamined assumption of a unified consciousness that "selects" outcomes. The article speaks of "consciousness" as though it were a single, stable entity confronting a quantum system and making choices. But what is this consciousness? Is it the same consciousness from moment to moment? Is it one thing or many?

The selection framework implicitly requires a substantial self—an agent that persists through time and maintains preferences about which neural outcomes to actualise. But consciousness as experienced is a stream, not a substance—an ever-changing series of moments, not a permanent selector. The article reifies consciousness into a causal agent while the Buddhist tradition would say this reification is precisely the kind of clinging that obscures the nature of experience.

Moreover, if consciousness "selects" outcomes in the brain, who or what selected the consciousness? The article creates an infinite regress: quantum outcomes need a selector (consciousness), but consciousness presumably also needs explanation. The regress is halted only by declaring consciousness primitive—which is just the Buddhist's point that the search for a fundamental self eventually reaches emptiness.

## Critical Issues

### Issue 1: The Equivocation on "Causation Without Energy"

- **File**: conservation-laws-and-mind.md
- **Location**: "Selection Without Injection" section, especially "Causation Without Energy Transfer"
- **Problem**: The article offers two models of causation without energy: (a) boundary conditions constraining outcomes, and (b) consciousness selecting among energetically equivalent quantum outcomes. These are fundamentally different. Boundary conditions are physical—they are spatial and temporal constraints imposed by the physical arrangement of the system. Consciousness, on the Map's view, is non-physical. The analogy between physical boundary conditions and non-physical consciousness is suggestive but not demonstrated. The article slides from "boundary conditions don't inject energy" (true, uncontroversial) to "consciousness doesn't inject energy" (the thing that needs proving) via analogy rather than argument.
- **Severity**: High
- **Recommendation**: Either develop the analogy into a rigorous argument—what precisely do boundary conditions and consciousness have in common that permits causation without energy?—or acknowledge the analogy's limits and present consciousness-as-selector as a distinct proposal requiring its own justification.

### Issue 2: The Decoherence Response Is Insufficient

- **File**: conservation-laws-and-mind.md
- **Location**: "Decoherence Closes the Gap" subsection
- **Problem**: The response to the decoherence objection hinges on two claims: (a) the selection framework doesn't require sustained coherence, and (b) decoherence doesn't determine which outcome becomes actual. But claim (a) undercuts the article's own reliance on Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism, which does require repeated observation of coherent states. And claim (b), while technically correct, doesn't establish that the "determination" requires consciousness rather than some as-yet-unknown physical process. The article jumps from "physics doesn't explain this" to "consciousness explains this" without considering the possibility that future physics might.
- **Severity**: High
- **Recommendation**: Acknowledge the tension between the "no sustained coherence needed" claim and the Stapp mechanism. Consider adding that the selection framework is compatible with multiple specific mechanisms, some of which do and some of which don't require coherence, rather than presenting them as a unified response.

### Issue 3: "Begs the Question" Argument Cuts Both Ways

- **File**: conservation-laws-and-mind.md
- **Location**: "Conservation Is Conditional on Symmetries" section
- **Problem**: The article argues, following Cucu and Pitts, that the conservation objection "begs the question" by assuming no external influences exist. This is a fair point. But the Map's position equally begs the question by assuming consciousness *is* an external influence on physical systems. The article doesn't acknowledge this symmetry. A reader persuaded by the question-begging charge could equally ask: doesn't the selection framework beg the question by assuming consciousness is non-physical and causally efficacious?
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Recommendation**: Acknowledge the dialectical symmetry explicitly. The point should be that the conservation objection cannot *settle* the debate, not that it shows the physicalist is wrong.

### Issue 4: Carroll Attribution May Be Incomplete

- **File**: conservation-laws-and-mind.md
- **Location**: "The Objection Stated" section
- **Problem**: The Sean Carroll quote about laws of physics underlying everyday life is from a 2011 blog post. Carroll's views have been elaborated substantially since then. While the quote accurately represents one formulation, presenting a blog post quote as the primary statement of the contemporary physics position risks making the opposition look less sophisticated than it is. Carroll has since discussed the question in more formal academic contexts.
- **Severity**: Low
- **Recommendation**: Either update with a more recent, formal Carroll source, or note the date of the quote and acknowledge that the physics case has been developed further.

## Counterarguments to Address

### The Born Rule Violation Problem
- **Current content says**: Consciousness selects among quantum-permitted outcomes without injecting energy
- **A critic would argue**: Any systematic bias away from Born rule predictions is, in principle, empirically detectable. If consciousness biases outcomes, it must do so by altering the probability distribution—which means violating the Born rule. Null results in quantum randomness tests (which are extensive) constrain how much biasing could occur.
- **Suggested response**: Acknowledge this constraint explicitly. Quantify it if possible—what upper bound do existing quantum randomness tests place on any systematic deviation from Born rule predictions? This would make the framework's empirical situation clearer rather than leaving it vague.

### The Selection Mechanism's Physical Instantiation
- **Current content says**: The selection framework "provides a model where causation can occur without energy injection"
- **A critic would argue**: Any physical change—including a change in which outcome occurs—must correspond to a change in the physical state. If consciousness changes which outcome actualises without changing anything physical, then it changes nothing. If it does change something physical, that change should be detectable.
- **Suggested response**: This may be the deepest objection the article faces. Consider addressing it head-on: either selection changes the physical state (in which case, what physical change occurs and is it detectable?) or it doesn't (in which case, what has consciousness actually done?).

## Unsupported Claims

| Claim | Location | Needed Support |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| "All possible outcomes are already present in the wavefunction with their associated energies" | Selection Without Injection | Needs demonstration that neural quantum states involved have degenerate (equal) energies; this is not obvious |
| "If outcomes A, B, and C each have probability 1/3 and identical energy" | Consciousness as Selector | The "identical energy" assumption is doing heavy lifting; it's unclear whether relevant neural quantum states are energetically degenerate |
| "Recent work by philosophers of physics demonstrates" | Opening paragraph | "Demonstrates" is too strong for philosophical arguments; these are arguments, not demonstrations |
| "Physics doesn't explain *why* one particular outcome occurs" | The Causal Gap at Measurement | Some interpretations (e.g., superdeterminism, objective collapse theories) would dispute this; the claim presupposes a particular reading of the measurement problem |

## Language Improvements

| Current | Issue | Suggested |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| "demonstrates that this objection rests on misunderstandings" | Too strong—"demonstrates" implies proof | "argues that this objection rests on misunderstandings" |
| "This is quite different from" | Slightly casual | "This differs substantially from" |
| "the conservation equation fails at those neural locations" | Stated as fact; this is the dualist hypothesis, not established physics | "under the dualist hypothesis, the conservation equation would fail at those neural locations" |
| "Conservation can fail *here* while holding *everywhere else*" | Asserts what needs arguing—that conservation does fail in brains | "Conservation *could* fail here while holding everywhere else" |

## Strengths (Brief)

Despite the above criticisms, the article has significant strengths worth preserving:

1. **Intellectual honesty**: The "Any Selection Mechanism Would Be Detectable" section openly acknowledges the framework's vulnerabilities. This is rare in partisan philosophical writing and should be retained.

2. **Strong opening**: The first paragraph is well-structured, front-loaded with the core claim, and survives truncation. It accurately characterises both the objection and the response.

3. **Clean argument structure**: The progression from stating the objection to showing why it fails to offering the selection alternative is logically clear and easy to follow.

4. **Proper attribution**: The article cites specific works by Pitts, Cucu, Carroll, Tegmark, and Hagan et al. These are real scholars making real arguments, not straw men.

5. **Appropriate scope**: The article addresses conservation specifically rather than trying to solve all problems for interactionist dualism at once. The "Objections and Responses" section engages with genuine difficulties rather than dismissing them.

6. **Style guide compliance**: The article follows the writing style guide well—front-loaded information, self-contained content, explicit tenet connection, proper references section. The "Relation to Site Perspective" section is substantive and connects to multiple tenets.
