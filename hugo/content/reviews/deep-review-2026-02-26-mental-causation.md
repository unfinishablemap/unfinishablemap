title: Deep Review - Mental Causation
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-26
**Article**: [Mental Causation](/concepts/mental-causation/)
**Previous review**: [2026-02-24](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-24-mental-causation/)
**Word count**: 3109 → 3124 (+15, near length-neutral)
**Context**: Cross-review considering conservation-laws-mind-brain-causation insights

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None. All attributions verified, no factual errors or internal contradictions.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing conservation objection response**: The article acknowledged conservation as a distinct challenge (Specification Challenge section) but never addressed it. Now that `conservation-laws-mind-brain-causation` provides a full treatment with Noether conditionality and selection-not-injection arguments, a brief subsection was warranted. [RESOLVED: Added "The Conservation Objection" subsection with Noether conditionality and selection-not-injection summary, citing Cucu and Pitts 2019]
- **Missing cross-links to conservation-laws-mind-brain-causation**: No links in frontmatter, body, or Further Reading. [RESOLVED: Added to concepts frontmatter, two body cross-links (new subsection + Specification Challenge mention), and Further Reading]

### Counterarguments Considered
All six adversarial personas engaged:
- Eliminative materialist: Illusionism section adequate; no new concerns
- Hard-nosed physicalist: Conservation objection gap identified and addressed
- Quantum skeptic: Conservation/energy question now answered in dedicated subsection
- MWI defender: Philosophical standoff remains (bedrock disagreement per stability notes)
- Empiricist: No new concerns; falsifiability conditions remain specific
- Buddhist philosopher: No specific concerns

### Attribution Accuracy Check
All attributions unchanged from previous review and verified:
- Kim's exclusion argument: Four premises correctly formulated ✓
- Saad's delegatory dualism: "Default causal profile" qualifier preserved ✓
- Stapp: Quantum Zeno/attention mechanism correctly attributed ✓
- Eccles: Vesicle release proposal correctly attributed ✓
- Lowe: Substance causation correctly characterized ✓
- Whitehead: Actual occasions and self-determination correctly attributed ✓
- Tallis: "Misrepresentation presupposes presentation" properly cited ✓
- Yablo: Proportional cause correctly attributed ✓
- Chalmers: Supervenience laws distinction correctly separated from Map's "selection laws" label ✓
- Cucu & Pitts: Noether conditionality argument correctly summarized (new addition) ✓
- No misattributions detected

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Self-stultification argument: Clear, epistemically powerful
- Kim's exclusion argument: Fair and comprehensive four-premise formulation
- Quantum opening explanation: Accessible without oversimplifying
- Delegatory dualism section: Properly preserves Saad's qualifiers
- Agent causation section: Good phenomenological grounding
- Falsifiability conditions: Specific and credible
- Process philosophy section: Complements agent causation well

### Enhancements Made
- Added "The Conservation Objection" subsection between Decoherence Challenge and Specification Challenge, addressing both Noether conditionality and selection-not-injection responses
- Added wikilink to conservation mention in Specification Challenge section
- Added `[conservation-laws-mind-brain-causation](/concepts/conservation-laws-mind-brain-causation/)` to concepts frontmatter and Further Reading
- Added Cucu & Pitts (2019) to References
- Tightened overdetermination section (removed redundant phrasing)
- Tightened delegatory dualism overdetermination distinction
- Removed redundant sentence in quantum opening section
- Consolidated process philosophy opening paragraph
- Tightened self-stultification prose (removed redundancy between argument and explanation)
- Tightened illusionism section (consolidated regress point)
- Condensed Bidirectional Interaction paragraph in Relation to Map's Perspective

### Cross-links Added
- [conservation-laws-mind-brain-causation](/concepts/conservation-laws-mind-brain-causation/) (new subsection, Specification Challenge, Further Reading, frontmatter)

## Remaining Items

None. The article now addresses all four major physics-based challenges (exclusion, decoherence, conservation, specification) and links to the dedicated conservation-laws treatment.

## Stability Notes

This is the sixth deep review. The article remains stable:

- **The MWI objection** remains a philosophical standoff. Bedrock disagreement, not a flaw.

- **The decoherence objection** is acknowledged as challenging while noting it doesn't solve the measurement problem.

- **The conservation objection** is now addressed with a dedicated subsection. The two-pronged response (Noether conditionality + selection-not-injection) matches the conservation-laws-mind-brain-causation article. Future reviews should NOT re-expand this—the full treatment is in the dedicated article.

- **The illusionist challenge** is engaged adequately. The regress problem remains the standard response.

- **The specification problem** is properly connected to the psychophysical-laws framework and includes the bandwidth problem as a distinct sub-challenge.

- **Conservation cross-link integrated**: The article now explicitly references and links to `conservation-laws-mind-brain-causation` in three locations (new subsection, specification challenge parenthetical, Further Reading).

The article is at 125% of soft threshold. No further expansion warranted. The article has comprehensive coverage of all major objections and responses. Future reviews should focus on accuracy maintenance and link integrity only.
