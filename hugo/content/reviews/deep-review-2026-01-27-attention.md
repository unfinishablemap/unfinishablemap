# Deep Review: Attention and Consciousness

**Date**: 2026-01-27
**File**: obsidian/concepts/attention.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-20

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Broken internal link**: `[Recent neuroscience](/archive/concepts/voluntary-attention-control/)` pointed to non-existent file. Resolved by correcting to `[Recent neuroscience](/concepts/voluntary-attention/)`.
- **Duplicate frontmatter entry**: `[voluntary-attention](/concepts/voluntary-attention/)` appeared twice in concepts list. Resolved by removing duplicate.

### Medium Issues Found
- None requiring changes. The decoherence treatment, while brief, already includes appropriate hedging ("The objection remains serious but not categorical") and links to the full treatment.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist**: Phenomenology of effort argument presupposes dualism. Response: Article already distinguishes correlation from identity; this is expected philosophical disagreement.
- **Dennett's heterophenomenology**: AST regress objection is question-begging. Response: Article links to illusionism for broader engagement; the regress problem is a standard objection.
- **Tegmark's decoherence calculation**: Hameroff rebuttals are contested. Response: Article acknowledges the objection is "serious" and links to decoherence.md for full treatment.
- **MWI defender**: Collapse not required for apparent selection. Response: Site's No Many Worlds tenet addresses this; article links to [many-worlds](/arguments/many-worlds/).

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent dissociation evidence (Koch & Tsuchiya, Block's overflow, Nartker 2025 eLife study)
- Clear willed-instructed-exogenous attention table with neural correlates
- Strong meditation section with FA/OM distinction and Brewer neurofeedback study
- Accurate presentation of Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism
- Comprehensive engagement with competing theories (GWT, IIT, AST)
- Well-developed "What Would Challenge This View?" section with five falsification conditions
- Process philosophy integration connecting Whitehead to interface hypothesis
- Mysterian angle acknowledging methodological deadlock
- Working memory section connecting to interface hypothesis

### Enhancements Made
- Fixed broken link to voluntary-attention
- Cleaned up duplicate frontmatter entry

### Cross-links Verified
All cross-links from previous review remain functional:
- [decoherence](/concepts/decoherence/)
- [mysterianism](/concepts/mysterianism/)
- [agent-causation](/concepts/agent-causation/)
- [pairing-problem](/concepts/pairing-problem/)
- [many-worlds](/arguments/many-worlds/)
- [voluntary-attention](/concepts/voluntary-attention/)

## Remaining Items

None. The article is in excellent shape following the comprehensive 2026-01-20 review. Only minor housekeeping issues (broken link, duplicate entry) required attention.

## Stability Notes

This article has reached stability. The previous review (2026-01-20) addressed all major structural issues:
- Added falsifiability section
- Added decoherence challenge acknowledgment
- Added mysterian angle
- Added process philosophy perspective
- Fixed vague citations

The current review found only maintenance issues (link correction, frontmatter cleanup). The core arguments are well-developed, tenet connections are explicit, and the article presents the Map's distinctive position while engaging fairly with opposing views.

**Philosophical disagreements that are bedrock, not fixable:**
- Functionalists will always find the "why does it feel like work?" argument question-begging
- MWI defenders will always find collapse-based accounts unsatisfying
- Eliminativists will always resist treating phenomenology as evidence

These represent fundamental philosophical positions, not article flaws.
