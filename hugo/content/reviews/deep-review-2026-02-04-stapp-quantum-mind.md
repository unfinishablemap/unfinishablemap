**Date**: 2026-02-04
**Article**: [Stapp's Quantum Mind Model](/concepts/stapp-quantum-mind/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-22](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-22-stapp-quantum-mind/)
**Context**: Cross-review considering attention-motor-quantum-interface insights

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The article has stabilized since the 2026-01-22 review, which addressed 3 critical and 5 medium issues.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Missing reference for cryptochrome paper** — The decoherence section (line 109) mentioned "2024 Nature Communications" evidence for quantum Zeno in cryptochrome but the reference wasn't in the References section.
   - **Resolution**: Added full citation: Denton, M.C.J., et al. (2024). Magnetosensitivity of tightly bound radical pairs in cryptochrome is enabled by the quantum Zeno effect. *Nature Communications*, 15, 10760.

### Counterarguments Considered

All six adversarial personas engaged:
- **Eliminative Materialist**: No new issues; effort phenomenology presented appropriately as "consistent with" framework
- **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: Previous review addressed willed/instructed distinction
- **Quantum Skeptic**: Decoherence section remains honestly qualified with "contested" language
- **Many-Worlds Defender**: Bedrock disagreement acknowledged; debate remains open
- **Empiricist**: Falsifiability predictions remain quantified and testable
- **Buddhist Philosopher**: Meditation/witness consciousness treatment is balanced

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- **Phenomenological precision**: Effort/effortlessness distinction remains well-grounded
- **James section**: Historical depth connecting Stapp to 1890 questions about effort
- **Conservation law satisfaction**: Lines explaining how mechanism avoids energy injection
- **Intellectual honesty**: Georgiev objection, decoherence challenge presented fairly
- **Quantified falsifiability**: Six testable predictions with specific thresholds

### Enhancements Made

1. **Unified attention-motor substrate** — Added paragraph in "Attention-as-Interface Extension" section connecting to Rizzolatti's premotor theory of attention (PMTA). The insight: attention and motor planning share neural substrates, so if Zeno works for attention, it should work identically for motor selection.

2. **Neural signatures reference** — Added mention of shared signatures (frontal theta, ~280-300ms timing, bidirectional coherence) that appear in both willed attention and willed action.

3. **Cross-link to attention-motor-quantum-interface** — Added to related_articles, connecting this concept article to the newer synthesis.

4. **Cryptochrome reference** — Added proper citation for the 2024 Nature Communications paper (Denton et al.) demonstrating quantum Zeno effect in biological magnetosensitivity.

### Cross-links Added

- [attention-motor-quantum-interface](/attention-motor-quantum-interface/) in related_articles and body text

## Remaining Items

None. The article is stable and well-integrated with the broader attention-motor-quantum framework.

## Stability Notes

This article has reached convergence after two review cycles. The previous review (2026-01-22) made substantial improvements; this cross-review adds integration with newer content but finds no structural issues. Key stability markers:

- **Philosophical disagreements acknowledged as such**: MWI, epiphenomenalism responses presented as defensible positions, not claimed victories
- **Decoherence treated honestly**: "contested," "remains active area of investigation" language appropriate
- **Attribution accuracy**: All claims properly sourced; cryptochrome reference now complete

Future reviews should NOT re-flag:
- The fundamental MWI disagreement (bedrock philosophical stance)
- Decoherence timescale uncertainty (honestly presented as unresolved)
- Epiphenomenalist alternatives (fair hearing given before defending causal account)

## Word Count

Before: 1976 words (79% of 2500 soft threshold)
After: ~2050 words (82% of soft threshold)

The modest expansion for attention-motor integration keeps the article well within limits.
