# Deep Review: Conscious vs Unconscious Processing

**Date**: 2026-01-25
**File**: obsidian/topics/conscious-vs-unconscious-processing.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Materialist conflation**: The article's core argument could be read as compatible with physicalism—showing that certain neural patterns (conscious) enable functions other patterns (unconscious) don't. **Resolution**: Added new section "The Physicalist Reading and Why It Fails" that directly addresses this objection, linking to the knowledge argument and qualia to show why the materialist redescription fails to answer the explanatory question.

2. **GNW is a physicalist theory**: The article cited Dehaene's Global Workspace Theory without noting it's a physicalist theory that claims consciousness *is* global broadcasting. **Resolution**: Added clarifying paragraph in "Relation to Site Perspective" explaining that the Map accepts the empirical findings while rejecting the reductive conclusion.

3. **Lieberman reference accuracy**: The claim about cognitive load specifically impairing logical reasoning cited a general review paper. **Resolution**: Softened the claim to "Research in social cognitive neuroscience suggests..." and corrected the publication year (2007, not 2008).

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Access vs. phenomenal consciousness**: The article admitted that access consciousness does the functional work, which a critic could use to argue this is fully describable in neural terms. **Resolution**: Added paragraph explaining that access consciousness is still consciousness—the distinction is epistemic, not ontological.

2. **Neural signatures are physical**: The neural signatures described (late amplification, synchronization, recurrent processing) are all physical, tacitly supporting physicalism. **Resolution**: Addressed through the new section explaining why physical correlates don't undermine dualism.

### Counterarguments Considered

1. **The materialist can accept all empirical findings**: Response added—the materialist redescription changes words without answering why global broadcasting enables what local processing cannot.

2. **GNW is not a dualist-friendly theory**: Response added—the Map uses the data, not the interpretation.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Excellent front-loaded opening with concrete empirical hook (2025 meta-analysis)
- Clear three-part functional structure (working memory, novel combinations, voluntary action)
- Phenomenological grounding ("you are reading these words")
- Epistemically humble treatment of failed neural markers
- Strong connection to epiphenomenalism critique in conclusion

### Enhancements Made

- Added "The Physicalist Reading and Why It Fails" section
- Strengthened access/phenomenal consciousness discussion
- Added clarification about GNW being a physicalist theory
- Added cross-link to free-will in voluntary action section
- Updated frontmatter with additional concept links

### Cross-links Added

- [qualia](/concepts/qualia/) (in new physicalist response section)
- [knowledge-argument](/concepts/knowledge-argument/) (in new physicalist response section)
- [free-will](/topics/free-will/) (in voluntary action section and related_articles)

## Word Count

- Before: 1544 words (51% of 3000 soft threshold)
- After: 1909 words (64% of 3000 soft threshold)
- Change: +365 words

## Remaining Items

None. All critical and medium issues addressed.
