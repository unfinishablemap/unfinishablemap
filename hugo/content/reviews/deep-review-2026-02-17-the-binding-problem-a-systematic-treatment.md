**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

- **Broken concept links to archived articles**: `[multimodal-binding](/concepts/phenomenal-binding-and-holism/)`, `[autonoetic-consciousness](/concepts/autonoetic-consciousness/)`, and `[neural-binding-mechanisms](/concepts/phenomenal-binding-and-holism/)` were all archived but still referenced in frontmatter and body text. Fixed: replaced with `[phenomenal-binding-and-holism](/concepts/phenomenal-binding-and-holism/)`, `[episodic-memory](/concepts/episodic-memory/)`, and updated body wikilinks accordingly.

- **Bayne & Chalmers attribution precision**: Article stated "This is Bayne and Chalmers's 'conjoint phenomenology' applied to thought" — implying they made this extension. Fixed: rephrased to "Extending Bayne and Chalmers's concept of 'conjoint phenomenology' from perception to thought" to make clear this is the Map's extension.

- **Filling-in claim misleading**: Original stated filling-in "produces phenomenal unity without corresponding computational binding at the retinal level" — conflating absence of retinal input with absence of computational binding (cortical processing does the binding). Fixed: rephrased to accurately describe the phenomenon as seamless experience despite absent sensory data.

### Medium Issues Found

- **NREM sleep claim overstated**: Original claimed brain "maintains neural synchrony" during NREM — misleading since NREM is characterized by reduced gamma synchrony. Fixed: changed to "substantial information processing — consolidating memories, replaying hippocampal sequences, integrating learned patterns."

- **Missing engagement with functionalist deflation**: Dennett's Multiple Drafts model denies unified experience requires explanation beyond functional coordination. Fixed: added brief paragraph in Classical Approaches section engaging with this response and pointing to the dissociation evidence as counter.

- **Quantum holism presented as interpretation-independent fact**: "Genuine holism where the whole is prior to parts" depends on realist interpretation of QM. Fixed: added parenthetical acknowledging interpretation-dependence and noting the Map adopts the realist reading.

- **Speculative quantum-collapse/agent-causation claim insufficiently hedged**: The cognitive binding section connected quantum collapse, agent causation, and parsing selection without hedging markers. Fixed: prefaced with "One speculative possibility" and restructured as conditional.

- **Missing cross-links**: Added `[downward-causation](/concepts/downward-causation/)` and `[prehension](/concepts/prehension/)` to concepts list. Added `[downward-causation](/concepts/downward-causation/)` to Further Reading. Removed broken `[multimodal-binding](/concepts/phenomenal-binding-and-holism/)` from Further Reading.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Eliminativist challenge** (phenomenal unity as folk-psychological construct): Deferred — the concept-level `[binding-problem](/concepts/binding-problem/)` article engages with this directly. The systematic treatment appropriately assumes the reality of phenomenal unity as its working framework.

- **Functionalist deflation** (Dennett's Multiple Drafts): Addressed — added brief engagement in Classical Approaches section pointing to dissociation evidence.

- **Quantum realism dependence** (Tegmark): Addressed — added interpretation caveat to quantum alternative section.

- **Buddhist anatta challenge** (subject binding assumes what it proves): Deferred — the `[split-brain-consciousness](/topics/split-brain-consciousness/)` article includes a Buddhist Complication section. Subject binding section in this article correctly identifies the presupposition without claiming to resolve it.

- **MWI branch-local definiteness** (each branch has definite binding): Noted but deferred — the No Many Worlds tenet connection uses the same argument found across the Map's other articles. Strengthening this specific argument is a site-wide concern, not specific to this article.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- **BP1/BP2 scaffold applied consistently** across all five varieties — the parallel structure builds a cumulative convergence argument that makes the conclusion feel inevitable
- **"Correlation is not identity"** — four-word distillation of the core dualist argument about binding (line 67)
- **Temporal binding phenomenology** — captures the specious present and temporal arc with genuine phenomenological fidelity
- **Subject binding formulation** — "The self is not another content that gets bound to other contents; it is the perspective from which binding is experienced" avoids homunculus regress
- **Restrained quantum presentation** — quantum holism appears as one of three theoretical positions, not as the centerpiece
- **Dissociation section as empirical backbone** — double dissociation (BP1 without BP2, BP2 exceeding available information) provides rigorous grounding
- **Tenet connections arising naturally** from preceding analysis rather than being tacked on

### Enhancements Made

- Fixed 3 broken archived concept links in frontmatter and body
- Corrected Bayne & Chalmers attribution to clarify the Map's extension of their framework
- Added functionalist deflation engagement in Classical Approaches
- Added quantum realism interpretation caveat
- Added hedging to speculative agent-causation claim
- Corrected NREM sleep characterization
- Fixed misleading filling-in claim
- Added cross-links: `[downward-causation](/concepts/downward-causation/)`, `[prehension](/concepts/prehension/)`
- Replaced broken `[multimodal-binding](/concepts/phenomenal-binding-and-holism/)` Further Reading entry with `[downward-causation](/concepts/downward-causation/)`

### Cross-links Added

- [downward-causation](/concepts/downward-causation/) (concepts list and Further Reading)
- [prehension](/concepts/prehension/) (concepts list)
- [episodic-memory](/concepts/episodic-memory/) (replaced archived [autonoetic-consciousness](/concepts/autonoetic-consciousness/))
- [phenomenal-binding-and-holism](/concepts/phenomenal-binding-and-holism/) (replaced archived [multimodal-binding](/concepts/phenomenal-binding-and-holism/) and [neural-binding-mechanisms](/concepts/phenomenal-binding-and-holism/))

## Remaining Items

- The "Unity as Primitive" section is the thinnest of three theoretical positions — could benefit from brief development connecting to [combination-problem](/concepts/combination-problem/) and process philosophy, but article is at 91% of soft threshold so expansion deferred.
- Sensory processing latency numbers (vision ~50ms, audition ~10ms, touch ~15ms) and temporal recalibration claim lack citations — broadly correct but could benefit from references in a future pass.
- The No Many Worlds tenet connection could engage with the branch-local definiteness response from MWI defenders — deferred as a site-wide concern across multiple articles.

## Stability Notes

- The six adversarial personas disagree with the article's dualist framework, its treatment of phenomenal unity as a datum, and its quantum alternative — these are bedrock philosophical disagreements, not flaws to fix. Future reviews should not re-flag "eliminativists reject phenomenal unity" or "functionalists deny the BP1/BP2 distinction" as issues requiring response.
- The Nagel quote ("too much unity to say 'two', yet too much separation to say 'one'") is used in its shortened form consistently across the Map. The full version with "in the specially contrived laboratory situations" appears in the research notes and split-brain-consciousness article. This is an acceptable editorial convention, not a misquotation.
