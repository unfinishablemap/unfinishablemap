title: Deep Review - Developing Phenomenal Value Realism
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Article**: [Developing Phenomenal Value Realism](/archive/topics/phenomenal-value-realism-development/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. No critical issues identified in this review.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **MWI "dilution" framing** (line 182-183): The article characterized many-worlds as "diluting" value across branches. This is misleading—each branch has its own value in MWI. **Resolution**: Replaced with the stronger indexical incoherence argument, which is the actual problem for token-based value.

2. **Value-experience dissociation engagement** (lines 165-167): The article mentioned depersonalization as a potential challenge but dismissed it too quickly without engaging with the clinical literature. **Resolution**: Added nuanced discussion noting that these cases typically involve altered phenomenal character rather than unchanged pleasure with detached value, while acknowledging more investigation would strengthen the position.

3. **Supervenience vs. irreducibility** (lines 111-113): The claim that value "inherits" irreducibility from consciousness could be clearer. **Resolution**: Added explanation that valence is constitutive of phenomenal states, not a higher-level property that supervenes on them—pain's badness is intrinsic to what pain is, not added separately.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Eliminative Materialist**: Challenged the phenomenological access claim—but the illusionist response section already addresses this adequately.
- **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: Challenged the Open Question closure claim as conflating epistemic access with metaphysical identity—this is a genuine philosophical standoff, not a fixable flaw.
- **Buddhist Philosopher**: Challenged the "experienced as intrinsic" response to emptiness—noted as a bedrock disagreement (see Stability Notes).
- **Empiricist**: Noted some falsifiability criteria are vague—but this reflects genuine philosophical difficulty, not poor argumentation.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

1. The clear structure: metaethics → hedonism extension → irreducibility implications → challenges
2. The table of phenomenal value features (lines 83-90)—makes abstract concepts concrete
3. The systematic tenet connections in "Relation to Site Perspective"
4. The nuanced incommensurability discussion ("no algorithmic answer")
5. Strong opening summary that survives truncation
6. Well-developed "What Would Challenge This View?" section

### Enhancements Made

1. Strengthened the supervenience/irreducibility argument with constitutive framing
2. Improved MWI discussion with indexical incoherence argument
3. Added engagement with depersonalization disorder as test case

### Cross-links Added

None new—article already has appropriate cross-links to concept article, tenets, and related articles.

## Remaining Items

None. All medium-priority issues were addressed.

## Stability Notes

- **Buddhist emptiness critique**: The article's response ("value is experienced as intrinsic") may not satisfy Buddhist philosophers who hold that nothing has intrinsic nature. This represents a genuine philosophical standoff between phenomenal realism and Madhyamaka Buddhism—it is a bedrock disagreement, not a flaw to fix in future reviews.

- **Functionalist/eliminativist objections**: The adversarial personas (Churchland, Dennett) will always find phenomenal value realism unsatisfying—that's expected philosophical disagreement, not an indication that the article needs revision.

- **MWI value problem**: The indexical incoherence argument is the strongest available. MWI defenders may respond that indexical questions are confused, but this is a clash of frameworks, not a weakness in the article's presentation.
