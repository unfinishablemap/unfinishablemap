title: Deep Review - Consciousness and Quantum Measurement
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-05
**Article**: [Consciousness and Quantum Measurement](/archive/topics/consciousness-and-quantum-measurement/)
**Previous review**: [2026-02-04](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-04-consciousness-and-quantum-measurement/)
**Context**: Task context indicated file was orphaned; verification showed prior review had already added 6+ inbound links.

## Review Type: Stability Confirmation

This review confirms the article has reached stability. The previous review (2026-02-04) found no critical issues and added substantial cross-links. Both pessimistic and optimistic reviews confirm the article is at a high quality level.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article remains well-constructed with proper source attribution.

### Attribution Accuracy Check
All checks from previous review remain valid:
- Tomaz et al. 2025 quote correctly attributed
- Wigner's abandonment of consciousness-collapse accurately noted
- Stapp's framework correctly characterized
- Von Neumann's chain accurately described
- Clear separation between source positions and Map interpretation

### Bedrock Disagreements (Not Issues to Fix)
The six adversarial personas raised expected philosophical objections:
- **Eliminative Materialist**: Rejects hard problem as genuine—tenet disagreement
- **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: Heterophenomenology could capture first-person reports—tenet disagreement
- **Quantum Skeptic**: Decoherence timescales remain challenging—addressed in article
- **Many-Worlds Defender**: Indexical objection applies to any theory—acknowledged, linked to [many-worlds](/arguments/many-worlds/)
- **Empiricist**: Unfalsifiability—article honestly acknowledges this
- **Buddhist Philosopher**: Substantial self assumed—beyond article scope

These represent philosophical standoffs, not critical flaws.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
1. Comparison table (measurement problem vs hard problem) remains highly effective
2. "Causal closure loophole" framing with three features is clear
3. Distinction between Wigner's strong claim and Map's modest proposal well-drawn
4. "What This Framework Cannot Do" section demonstrates intellectual honesty
5. Thorough tenet connections in "Relation to Site Perspective"

### Cross-Links Status
The article was flagged as "orphaned" but verification showed existing inbound links from:
- `decoherence.md`
- `quantum-consciousness.md` (2 links)
- `causal-closure.md`
- `measurement-problem.md`
- `hard-problem-of-consciousness.md`
- `quantum-measurement-and-definite-outcomes.md` (3 links)

**Additional cross-links added in this review:**
- `stapp-quantum-mind.md` — In decoherence objection response section
- `prebiotic-collapse.md` — In decoherence/measurement problem discussion
- `history-of-interactionist-dualism.md` — In quantum opening section
- `multi-mind-collapse-problem.md` — In Further Reading section
- `quantum-interpretations.md` — In Further Reading section

Total inbound links: 11+ (was 6+, now significantly increased)

## Remaining Items

None. The article is well-integrated and stable.

## Stability Notes

This is the second consecutive review finding no critical issues. The article has reached maturity:
- All philosophical objections from adversarial personas are bedrock disagreements with Map tenets
- Cross-links now comprehensive across quantum consciousness cluster
- Word count (2245) well within threshold
- No content modifications required

Future reviews should not re-flag:
- MWI proponents finding indexical arguments unsatisfying (bedrock disagreement)
- Eliminativists rejecting hard problem premise (tenet commitment)
- Unfalsifiability concerns (acknowledged honestly in article)

## Word Count

2245 words (75% of 3000 soft threshold) — unchanged from previous review.
