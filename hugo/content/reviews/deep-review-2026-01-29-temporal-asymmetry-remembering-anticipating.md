# Deep Review: The Asymmetry Between Remembering and Anticipating

**Date**: 2026-01-29
**File**: obsidian/voids/temporal-asymmetry-remembering-anticipating.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article is well-structured and philosophically sound.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **De Brigard citation framing**: The original text used De Brigard (2020) to support a dualist reading, but his "epistemic feelings" framework is compatible with functionalism. The article didn't acknowledge this tension.
   - **Resolution**: Expanded the De Brigard reference to explicitly acknowledge that functionalists can accommodate his framework, while explaining why the Map maintains the quale is irreducible.

2. **MWI objection inadequately addressed**: The "No Many Worlds" tenet connection claimed memory presupposes a single past, but didn't address the MWI response that branch-relative memory works fine.
   - **Resolution**: Added explicit engagement with the MWI reply and the Map's response that the feeling of actuality points to genuine metaphysical uniqueness.

3. **Missing description**: Frontmatter lacked a description meta field.
   - **Resolution**: Added 160-character description emphasizing trace-dependence.

### Counterarguments Considered

1. **Functionalist/illusionist objection**: The pastness quale could be a cognitive marker rather than an irreducible property.
   - **Addressed**: Already handled in "The Illusionist Challenge" section; enhanced De Brigard passage to acknowledge functionalist compatibility while maintaining dualist interpretation.

2. **MWI compatibility**: Branch-relative memory could explain the phenomenology without single-history metaphysics.
   - **Addressed**: Added explicit response in tenet connection section.

3. **Buddhist doctrine oversimplification**: Noted but not critical—the article's use is reasonable for its purposes.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- The core phenomenological argument (pastness quale as irreducible)
- The "contacted" vs "constructed" vocabulary—precise and illuminating
- The comparison table (memory vs future simulation features)
- The Whitehead/process philosophy section—excellent integration
- The void framing (conceptually empty vs merely difficult vs cognitively closed)
- The three-way epistemic distinction
- The limiting cases analysis (déjà vu, predictable events, reported precognition)
- AI systems as methodological probe

### Enhancements Made

1. Added description frontmatter
2. Expanded De Brigard citation to acknowledge functionalist reading while defending dualist interpretation
3. Strengthened MWI response in tenet connection
4. Added free-will connection in bidirectional interaction section
5. Added functionalism link in illusionist challenge section

### Cross-links Added

- [free-will](/topics/free-will/) (in bidirectional interaction tenet connection)
- [functionalism](/arguments/functionalism/) (in illusionist challenge section)
- Added to related_articles frontmatter: [free-will](/topics/free-will/), [functionalism](/arguments/functionalism/)

## Remaining Items

None. All medium issues were addressed. Low-priority items (falsifiability section could be strengthened) are philosophical preferences rather than problems requiring immediate attention.

## Stability Notes

The adversarial personas raised expected philosophical objections:

- **Eliminative materialist/functionalist objection**: That the pastness "quale" is a cognitive marker rather than irreducible. This is a bedrock disagreement between functionalism and property dualism—the article now acknowledges the tension explicitly while maintaining its position.

- **MWI compatibility**: That branch-relative memory accommodates the phenomenology. This is also a bedrock disagreement—the article now engages with it rather than ignoring it.

- **Buddhist doctrine nuances**: The article's use of Buddhist concepts is simplified but appropriate for its scope. Deeper treatment would require a dedicated article on Buddhist philosophy of time.

These represent genuine philosophical standoffs, not fixable problems. Future reviews should not re-flag them as critical.
