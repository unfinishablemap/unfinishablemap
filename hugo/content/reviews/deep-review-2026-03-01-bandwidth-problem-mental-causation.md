title: Deep Review - The Bandwidth Problem in Mental Causation
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-03-01
**Article**: [The Bandwidth Problem in Mental Causation](/concepts/bandwidth-problem-mental-causation/)
**Previous review**: [2026-02-24](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-24-bandwidth-problem-mental-causation/)
**Context**: Cross-review considering resolution-void insights

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article remains well-constructed and internally consistent. All citations are accurate, no attribution errors, no source/Map conflation.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing resolution-void cross-link**: The resolution void article (published 2026-02-28) already links to this article, but the bandwidth problem article had no reciprocal connection despite significant conceptual overlap. Added resolution void context in the Grain Problem section and a nested-void insight in the Format Translation section.
- **Nested void insight missing from format translation**: The format translation section discussed the challenge of mapping phenomenal states to physical observables but didn't note the resolution gap — consciousness performing quantum selections at scales below its own phenomenal resolution. Added paragraph connecting this to the coupling law specification problem.

### Low Issues Found
None new.

### Counterarguments Considered
- All six adversarial personas engaged. No new critical objections beyond those identified in the 2026-02-24 review.
- **Eliminative Materialist**: Hierarchical selection remains compatible with materialism — bedrock standoff per previous review.
- **MWI Defender**: Selection presupposes collapse — bedrock tenet disagreement per previous review.
- **Empiricist**: Testability applies to all interactionist dualism — per previous review.
- **Quantum Skeptic**: Stapp hedging is adequate (improved in previous review).

### Attribution Accuracy Check
- [x] Kim's causal exclusion argument — correctly attributed
- [x] Stapp's quantum Zeno framework — correctly attributed and appropriately hedged as "one proposed mechanism"
- [x] Zheng & Meister (2025) 10 bits/second figure — correctly cited
- [x] Norretranders (1998) 10⁹ bits/second figure — correctly cited
- [x] No dropped qualifiers detected
- [x] No source/Map conflation — Map's framework clearly distinguished from cited sources
- [x] No self-contradictions

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Three-dimension framework (capacity, grain, format) — outstanding organizing device
- Exclusion vs. bandwidth comparison table — immediately clarifies the distinction
- Honest acknowledgment of residual format translation problem — builds trust
- Front-loaded opening claim — survives truncation well
- Hierarchical selection response with epiphenomenalism counter (from previous review)
- "Two Failed Responses" section — efficient argumentative structure
- Well-constructed Relation to Site Perspective engaging three tenets

### Enhancements Made
- Added resolution void context in Grain Problem section — contextualizes the bandwidth problem as the downward-direction consequence of the broader resolution gap
- Added nested void insight in Format Translation section — consciousness performing quantum selections below its own resolution threshold adds a genuine additional constraint on coupling laws
- Added resolution-void to Further Reading with description
- Added resolution-void to frontmatter related_articles

### Cross-links Added
- [resolution-void](/voids/resolution-void/) — contextual link in Grain Problem section and Format Translation section, plus Further Reading

## Remaining Items
None. All identified improvements were addressed.

## Stability Notes
- Previous review's stability notes remain in force: MWI objection is bedrock, eliminative materialist standoff is genuine, testability concern is framework-level.
- The resolution void connection is now established bidirectionally. Future reviews should not add further resolution-void material unless the resolution void article itself changes substantially.
- The article has now been reviewed twice and is approaching stability. The argumentative structure, tenet connections, and citation accuracy are all solid. Future reviews should focus on verifying continued accuracy rather than seeking expansion opportunities.
