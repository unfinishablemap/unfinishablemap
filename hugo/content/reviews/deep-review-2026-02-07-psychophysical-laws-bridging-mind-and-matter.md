topics: []

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Article**: [Psychophysical Laws: Bridging Mind and Matter](/topics/psychophysical-laws-bridging-mind-and-matter/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-27](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-27-psychophysical-laws/) (pre-coalescence version)

## Context

This article was coalesced on 2026-02-07 from three separate articles (chalmers-psychophysical-coupling, psychophysical-laws-framework, psychophysical-coupling-law-mechanisms). The previous review was on the pre-coalescence concept article, so this review treats the coalesced article as substantially new content.

## Attribution Verification

Thorough source verification against three research notes (chalmers-psychophysical-laws-2026-01-17, psychophysical-coupling-problem-2026-01-15, psychophysical-coupling-law-mechanisms-2026-01-23) and three archived source articles. Results:

- **All attributions verified**: Chalmers, Saad, Stapp, Eccles correctly attributed
- **Qualifier preservation**: Excellent — "research program worth exploring" not overstated, scope of double-aspect theory marked as open
- **Source/Map separation**: Clear throughout — "The Map's divergence:", "The Map's engagement:" markers
- **No false shared commitments**: Article explicitly notes Chalmers-McQueen sympathy for MWI vs Map's commitment to collapse
- **Minor year discrepancy**: Research notes say Meister (2024), article says Zheng & Meister (2025) — likely publication timing, not substantive

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The coalesced article passes all attribution checks, has no factual errors, no internal contradictions, and all required sections are present.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Testability gap not explicit**: Article claimed framework is testable while admitting no current tests exist. Made this tension explicit in the specification problem section.
   - **Resolution**: Rewrote final paragraph of specification section to acknowledge gap between "testable in principle" and "currently testable."

2. **Missing cross-link to downward-causation concept**: The Upward-Downward Asymmetry section discussed downward causation without linking the dedicated concept page.
   - **Resolution**: Added `[downward-causation](/concepts/downward-causation/)` link and added to concepts frontmatter.

3. **Missing cross-link to coupling-modes concept**: Candidate mechanisms section didn't reference the coupling modes taxonomy.
   - **Resolution**: Added `[coupling-modes](/concepts/coupling-modes/)` parenthetical and added to concepts frontmatter.

### Low Issues Found
1. **William James citation incomplete**: "The essential phenomenon of will" quote lacked source work.
   - **Resolution**: Added *The Principles of Psychology* (1890) citation inline.

### Counterarguments Considered
- Eliminativist critique: Presupposes hard problem is genuine — bedrock disagreement (Map tenet)
- MWI proponent critique: Rejection of Many-Worlds is a tenet-level commitment
- Empiricist testability concern: Addressed by making testability gap explicit rather than papering over it

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent opening summary with front-loaded core claim
- Tiered mechanism ranking — unique analytical contribution
- Three candidate discriminators for Stapp's mechanism — novel specification
- "What Would Challenge This View?" — six honest, specific conditions
- Pain asymbolia example — concrete, empirically grounded
- Convergence problem section — philosophically sophisticated
- Clear Source/Map separation markers throughout

### Enhancements Made
1. Testability gap made explicit (intellectual honesty improvement)
2. Cross-link to [downward-causation](/concepts/downward-causation/) added
3. Cross-link to [coupling-modes](/concepts/coupling-modes/) added
4. William James citation completed

### Cross-links Added
- [downward-causation](/concepts/downward-causation/) (Upward-Downward Asymmetry section + concepts frontmatter)
- [coupling-modes](/concepts/coupling-modes/) (Candidate Coupling Mechanisms section + concepts frontmatter)

## Word Count

- Before: 3173 words (106% of 3000 target)
- After: 3214 words (107% of 3000 target)
- Change: +41 words (additions partially offset by prose tightening)

Article remains above soft threshold but within acceptable range. Changes were approximately length-neutral with compensating trims.

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues were addressed.

## Stability Notes

This is the first review of the coalesced article. The coalescence was done responsibly — all attributions verified against source material, epistemic hedging preserved from refined source articles.

The following represent fundamental philosophical disagreements rather than fixable problems:
- **Eliminativist critique**: The article presupposes the hard problem is genuine (Map tenet)
- **MWI proponent critique**: Rejection of many-worlds is a tenet-level commitment
- **Phenomenology skepticism**: The Map holds first-person evidence is indispensable (bedrock disagreement)
- **Functionalist critique of haecceity**: The Map's rejection of strong organizational invariance is a philosophical commitment, not a fixable flaw

Future reviews should focus on new evidence or content integration rather than re-examining these settled positions.
