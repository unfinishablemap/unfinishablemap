title: Deep Review - Idealism
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-01-20
**Article**: [Idealism](/concepts/idealism/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Missing explicit "Relation to Site Perspective" section**: The article had content serving this function dispersed throughout but lacked the required section header. Resolution: Added explicit section consolidating The Unfinishable Map's position.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Limited cross-linking to newer content**: The article predated `dualism.md` and `analytic-idealism.md` concept pages. Resolution: Added cross-links to both in frontmatter and body text.
- **Opening summary buried key site position**: The distinction from site framework was in paragraph 2 rather than front-loaded. Resolution: Strengthened opening to state site position immediately after defining idealism.
- **Missing concept links**: `explanatory-gap`, `agent-causation`, `interactionist-dualism` were referenced but not wikilinked. Resolution: Added wikilinks throughout.

### Counterarguments Considered

**Eliminative Materialist (Churchland)**: The article accepts the explanatory gap without addressing eliminativism's response that folk psychological concepts will be eliminated. *Assessment*: the Map's framework explicitly rejects eliminativism via the Dualism tenet; extensive engagement here would dilute focus. The gap argument is presented as motivation, not proof.

**Quantum Skeptic (Tegmark)**: Quantum consciousness claims presented without decoherence caveats. *Assessment*: The tenets.md page addresses decoherence objections in detail; this article appropriately refers to quantum mechanisms without relitigating the full debate.

**Buddhist Philosophy (Nagarjuna)**: Eastern idealist traditions unmentioned. *Assessment*: The article focuses on Western analytic idealism (Kastrup, Berkeley) as the primary interlocutor. Eastern perspectives are addressed in analytic-idealism.md which explicitly discusses Advaita Vedanta parallels. Adding extensive Eastern coverage here would create redundancy.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear opening summary defining idealism and its relationship to physicalism
- Effective comparison table (idealism vs. site framework)
- Strong treatment of "Crucial Disagreement" section—philosophically precise
- Balanced "Idealism's Advantages" section showing fair engagement
- The "Picture That Emerges" concluding summary effectively frames the choice

### Enhancements Made
- Front-loaded the Map's position in the opening paragraphs
- Added explicit "Relation to Site Perspective" section consolidating the Map's stance
- Strengthened indexical identity argument with agent-causation link
- Added reference to foundational dualism.md article in "Interaction Problem" section
- Expanded Further Reading with all relevant concept pages

### Cross-links Added
- `[dualism](/concepts/dualism/)` — foundational overview
- `[analytic-idealism](/concepts/analytic-idealism/)` — detailed Kastrup treatment
- `[interactionist-dualism](/concepts/interactionist-dualism/)` — site's position on interaction
- `[explanatory-gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/)` — key concept now linked
- `[agent-causation](/concepts/agent-causation/)` — connection to free will and indexical identity

## Remaining Items

None. The article is now well-integrated with newer site content, has explicit tenet connection, and preserves its original strengths while addressing cross-linking gaps.
