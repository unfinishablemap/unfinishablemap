## Executive Summary

This cluster addresses the epistemological foundations of the Map's entire project: Can first-person methods produce genuine evidence? The articles are philosophically sophisticated, cite appropriate sources (Husserl, Varela, Dennett, Nisbett & Wilson, Petitmengin, Fox), and maintain internal coherence. They make a strong case for methodological pluralism and the irreducibility of phenomenological evidence.

However, the cluster exhibits systematic vulnerabilities that undermine its foundational role. First, all three articles argue from the existence of the methodological gap to ontological dualism—but this inference is contested, and the articles don't adequately engage alternative explanations for why the gap persists. Second, the cluster relies heavily on contemplative training to rescue introspection's reliability, but the evidence cited (Fox et al. 2012) is a single cross-sectional study that doesn't establish causal direction. Third, the articles simultaneously defend introspection as reliable for phenomenal content while acknowledging deep structural limits (unobservable self, error-blindness, introspective opacity)—but don't clearly specify which claims about consciousness rest on which supposedly reliable access.

The fundamental problem: these articles provide the *epistemological foundation* for all of the Map's claims about consciousness. If the foundation has cracks—if first-person evidence is less reliable than claimed, or if the inference from methodological to ontological dualism fails—the entire edifice is compromised. The cluster is internally coherent but doesn't adequately address external challenges to its core assumptions.

## Critiques by Philosopher

### The Eliminative Materialist (Patricia Churchland)

"Three articles defending first-person methods as providing genuine evidence about consciousness. Let me trace the assumptions buried in this defense.

The first-person/third-person methodology article claims the persistent need for dual methodologies 'is best explained by ontological dualism.' But this assumes methodological gaps require ontological explanation. Consider: why isn't physics unified with biology? We need different methods to study atoms and ecosystems. Nobody concludes atoms and organisms are ontologically distinct categories requiring dualism. The methodological gap between first-person and third-person approaches might simply reflect the practical difficulty of studying complex systems from the inside—an epistemic limit, not an ontological discovery.

The article invokes neurophenomenology's 'mutual constraint' as evidence for bidirectional interaction. But mutual constraint is *methodological*—it says phenomenology constrains which neuroscientific theories are adequate, not that phenomenology *causes* neural events. Methodological feedback loops don't require ontological dualism. When psychology constrains neuroscience (this theory must explain this behavior), we don't conclude behavior is ontologically distinct from brain states.

The phenomenological evidence article claims introspection becomes reliable 'when gathered through rigorous methods.' But the evidence cited is Fox et al. 2012—a single cross-sectional study of meditation practitioners showing correlation between practice and introspective accuracy. Cross-sectional studies can't establish causation. Maybe people with better introspective accuracy are drawn to meditation. Maybe both are caused by personality traits the study didn't measure. The article treats this as vindicating trained introspection when it shows only correlation.

The introspection article distinguishes mental *processes* (inaccessible) from mental *contents* (accessible). But this distinction does all the work while remaining vague. What counts as 'content' versus 'process'? The article says phenomenal character—'what it's like'—is content. But we confabulate about *what it's like* all the time. People misremember dreams; people can't report peripheral phenomenology reliably; people disagree about their inner speech. The process/content distinction doesn't cleanly separate reliable from unreliable introspection."

### The Hard-Nosed Physicalist (Daniel Dennett)

"Let me examine the rhetorical strategies across this cluster.

The first-person/third-person article criticizes heterophenomenology for 'treating first-person authority as authority about what subjects claim, not about what exists.' But this is precisely what scientific caution requires. When a patient reports 'I see purple spots,' we record the report. We then investigate whether there are actual purple spots, or whether the patient is hallucinating, or whether they mean something idiosyncratic by 'purple.' The Map wants to skip directly from 'subjects report phenomenal experience' to 'phenomenal experience exists as subjects report it.' This is exactly the inferential leap that heterophenomenology refuses to make—and for good reason.

The phenomenological evidence article claims heterophenomenology 'brackets the very features that need explaining.' But what features? If phenomenal properties are real, they should have effects that third-person methods can detect. The methodological problem the article describes—that phenomenology resists objective description—is precisely what we'd expect if phenomenal properties as independently existing entities don't exist. The article treats the methodological difficulty as evidence for dualism when it's equally evidence for eliminativism.

The introspection article invokes the 'regress response' to illusionism: if phenomenal consciousness is an illusion, the seeming to have it must be explained, and 'seeming to be in pain is a form of conscious experience.' But this begs the question. Illusionists explain the seeming without postulating phenomenal properties over and above the neural representations that produce the seeming. The 'seeming' isn't a different thing from the neural activity; it *is* what neural activity does. The regress stops at the physical processes that produce the reports—there's no further 'what it's like' requiring explanation.

The introspection article also claims that illusionism is 'self-undermining' because 'how do illusionists know they've understood their own arguments?' But this applies equally to dualists. If introspection is reliable, how do dualists know their introspection of phenomenal properties isn't itself an error? The self-undermining argument proves too much."

### The Quantum Skeptic (Max Tegmark)

"These articles don't directly invoke quantum mechanics, but they set up the epistemological framework the Map uses to justify quantum consciousness claims. Let me examine whether that framework can bear the weight.

The first-person/third-person article claims phenomenal properties are 'not logically entailed by third-person observable facts.' But 'logical entailment' is a high bar. Consciousness might be metaphysically necessitated by physical facts even without logical entailment—just as water being H₂O isn't logically entailed by chemical analysis but is metaphysically necessary. The article slides from 'not logically entailed' to 'ontologically distinct' without engaging the distinction between conceivability and metaphysical possibility.

The introspection article claims trained meditators provide reliable data about phenomenal experience. But what makes their reports reliable? The answer can't be 'they accurately report phenomenal properties'—that's circular. The answer must be either: (a) their reports predict independent measures (neural correlates), or (b) their reports converge with other trained observers. Both criteria are third-person validation criteria. The supposedly first-person evidence gains credibility only through third-person methods.

This matters for quantum consciousness claims. If the Map invokes first-person evidence to support claims about quantum processes in the brain, that evidence must eventually connect to measurable predictions. The introspection article acknowledges that introspection can't access causal processes—only content. But quantum consciousness claims are precisely claims about causal processes: that consciousness collapses wavefunctions, that quantum effects underlie phenomenal unity. First-person methods can't access these processes by the article's own admission. The epistemological framework these articles provide *doesn't support* the quantum claims the Map makes elsewhere."

### The Many-Worlds Defender (David Deutsch)

"These methodological articles don't explicitly invoke No Many Worlds, but the introspection article claims 'introspective reports uniformly describe singular, determinate experiences' as evidence against superposition.

But this is exactly what MWI predicts. Each branch contains observers who have determinate experiences and report them as singular. The branch-relative phenomenology is as determinate as the dualist claims—within each branch. The 'singularity' of experience that introspection reveals is branch-relative singularity, perfectly compatible with there being other branches with other equally singular experiences.

The article's claim that 'no contemplative tradition reports phenomenology consistent with superposition' proves only that introspection can't distinguish between MWI (many branches, each with singular experience) and Copenhagen (one branch, singular experience). This is an *epistemic limit* of introspection, not evidence for collapse. MWI predicts that introspection would reveal exactly what it does reveal—because introspection is a physical process that decoheres along with everything else.

The methodological claim that first-person methods access something third-person methods can't is challenged by MWI's explanation of why phenomenology seems private: decoherence prevents information transfer between branches. The 'privacy' of first-person experience that the articles treat as evidence for dualism is explained by MWI as a consequence of decoherence—no dualism required.

This connects to the quantum skeptic's point: if introspection can't access causal processes, it can't distinguish between collapse interpretations (consciousness involved) and no-collapse interpretations (decoherence sufficient). The first-person epistemology these articles develop doesn't support the interpretation-dependent claims the Map makes elsewhere."

### The Empiricist (Karl Popper's Ghost)

"Let me assess falsifiability across this cluster.

The first-person/third-person article claims the explanatory gap's persistence is 'evidence for ontological dualism.' But what would falsify this? If neuroscience eventually explained phenomenal consciousness in third-person terms, the dualist could always retreat: 'that explains the functions, not the phenomenal properties.' The article acknowledges this: 'If neuroscience developed explanations that genuinely addressed phenomenal character—not just functional correlates—rather than changing the subject from consciousness to information processing, the abductive case for dualism would weaken.' But this presupposes we can distinguish 'explaining phenomenal character' from 'explaining functional correlates'—and the dualist criterion for that distinction guarantees neuroscience can never meet it.

The phenomenological evidence article lists conditions that make reports reliable: temporal stability, predictive power, structural coherence, independence from theory, resistance to suggestion. These are operationalizable criteria—good. But the article doesn't explain what would count as phenomenological evidence *against* dualism. Trained meditators converge on certain descriptions; what if their convergence supported physicalism? The article assumes convergent phenomenology supports dualism, but convergent phenomenology is equally consistent with physicalist explanations (trained observers report brain states accurately).

The introspection article's process/content distinction is unfalsifiable as stated. When introspection fails (choice blindness, confabulation), that's process failure. When introspection succeeds (trained phenomenological reports), that's content access. But no criterion specifies in advance which is which. Any failure can be attributed to process; any success can be attributed to content. The distinction is preserved come what may.

The articles' core claim—that first-person methods provide evidence for dualism—faces the same problem: what first-person evidence would count against it? If introspective reports supporting physicalism are dismissed as 'accessing the wrong domain,' and reports supporting dualism are privileged as 'accessing content,' the evidential framework is rigged."

### The Buddhist Philosopher (Nagarjuna)

"These articles defend first-person methods while acknowledging the unobservable self. Let me explore the tension.

The introspection article quotes Hume: 'I can never catch myself at any time without a perception.' It acknowledges 'the observer cannot observe itself observing' and that 'the content that *is* current observing cannot be observed without transforming into past content.' This is the key insight of dependent origination: there is no observer apart from the observing, no self apart from the stream.

Yet the first-person/third-person article claims 'epistemic asymmetry reflects ontological asymmetry' between phenomenal and physical properties. But if there is no substantial self to be the locus of first-person access, what does 'first-person' mean? The articles treat 'first-person perspective' as primitive, when careful phenomenological analysis shows it to be constructed from the stream of experience.

The phenomenological evidence article claims trained contemplatives provide reliable data. But which contemplatives? Buddhist contemplatives report no-self as a phenomenological discovery. Hindu contemplatives report a witnessing Self. The articles assume convergence, but the traditions diverge on precisely the point most relevant to dualism: whether there is a substantial subject.

The Map tries to preserve 'subject' without 'substance': 'What persists... is not a *substance* but a *subject*—the indexical fact that these experiences are *this* consciousness's experiences.' But 'this' presupposes the very continuity Buddhist analysis deconstructs. Careful introspection reveals that 'this consciousness' is itself a construction—arising in dependence on memory, expectation, and conceptual elaboration. The first-person epistemology assumes what rigorous first-person investigation dissolves.

The introspection article treats Buddhist phenomenology as 'complicating' the picture. But Buddhist phenomenology doesn't merely complicate—it *undermines* the reified 'first-person perspective' these articles presuppose. First-person methods, rigorously applied, reveal the emptiness of the first person."

## Critical Issues

### Issue 1: Methodological-to-Ontological Inference Undefended

- **Files**: All three articles, especially `first-person-third-person-methodology.md`
- **Location**: Opening (36), Epistemic Asymmetry section (107-113), Relation to Site Perspective (127-135)
- **Problem**: The articles argue from methodological dualism (needing both first-person and third-person methods) to ontological dualism (consciousness and physical processes are distinct kinds). But this inference is contested. Physics and biology require different methods without implying different ontologies. The methodological gap might reflect practical epistemic limits, not ontological distinctness. The articles present the inference as if it were straightforward when it requires substantial additional argument.
- **Severity**: High
- **Recommendation**: Explicitly address alternative explanations for the methodological gap. Why is the first-person/third-person gap evidence for ontological dualism rather than evidence for epistemic complexity in studying integrated systems? What distinguishes this gap from other methodological divisions in science? The abductive case for dualism needs stronger argument about why alternative explanations fail.

### Issue 2: Training Evidence Overstated

- **Files**: `phenomenological-evidence-methodology.md`, `introspection.md`
- **Location**: phenomenological:60-61, introspection:69-70
- **Problem**: Both articles cite Fox et al. 2012 as evidence that training improves introspective reliability. But this single cross-sectional study shows correlation between meditation experience and introspective accuracy—not causation. The study can't rule out selection effects (accurate introspectors are drawn to meditation) or confounds (personality traits affect both). The articles present this as establishing that 'meditation experience predicts introspective accuracy' following a 'learning curve,' but cross-sectional data can't establish learning curves—that requires longitudinal study.
- **Severity**: High
- **Recommendation**: Acknowledge the evidential limitations: 'Fox et al. 2012 found correlation between meditation experience and introspective accuracy, though cross-sectional design can't establish causal direction.' If other evidence exists (longitudinal studies, experimental interventions), cite it. Currently the training argument leans heavily on one correlation study.

### Issue 3: Process/Content Distinction Does Excessive Work

- **Files**: `introspection.md`
- **Location**: Process vs Content section (52-67), throughout
- **Problem**: The distinction between inaccessible mental *processes* and accessible mental *contents* carries the article's central argument. But the boundary is never clearly specified. What exactly counts as 'content' versus 'process'? When introspection fails (choice blindness), it's process failure. When introspection succeeds (trained phenomenological reports), it's content access. This risks being unfalsifiable: any failure can be attributed to process domain; any success to content domain. The distinction needs independent specification.
- **Severity**: High
- **Recommendation**: Provide clearer criteria for the process/content distinction. Are there cases where content access fails? How would we recognize content-access failure versus process-access failure? What would falsify the claim that content access is reliable? Without answers, the distinction protects the reliability claim from empirical challenge.

### Issue 4: Structural Limits Undermine Reliability Claims

- **Files**: `introspection.md`
- **Location**: Unobservable Self (132-139), Error-Blindness (142-146), throughout
- **Problem**: The article acknowledges profound structural limits: the observer cannot observe itself, being wrong about introspective reports feels exactly like being right, introspection modifies its target. Yet the article maintains that phenomenal content access is 'reliable.' These acknowledgments seem to undermine rather than support reliability. If error-blindness means 'introspection is the tool we use to check our introspective reports, but if the tool is producing errors, it cannot detect them,' how can introspection be trusted for any domain? The article doesn't resolve how 'content access' survives these structural limits.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Recommendation**: Explicitly reconcile the structural limits with the reliability claim. If the observer cannot observe itself and error-blindness prevents error detection, what remains reliable? Be specific about which claims the Map makes rest on which supposedly reliable introspective access. Currently the limits and the reliability claim sit uneasily together.

### Issue 5: Heterophenomenology Mischaracterized

- **Files**: `first-person-third-person-methodology.md`, `phenomenological-evidence-methodology.md`
- **Location**: first-person:52-63, phenomenological:117-123
- **Problem**: Both articles present heterophenomenology as 'officially neutral about phenomenology's ontological status' but then criticize it for 'bracketing' phenomenal reality. But heterophenomenology *is* officially neutral—it neither affirms nor denies phenomenal properties. The criticism that it 'systematically brackets the very features that need explaining' assumes those features exist as the Map describes them—which is precisely what heterophenomenology declines to assume. The articles criticize heterophenomenology for not sharing the Map's assumptions rather than engaging it on its own terms.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Recommendation**: Engage heterophenomenology more fairly. Dennett's point is that science can proceed without settling the metaphysical question. If the Map disagrees—if it thinks science *cannot* proceed without affirming phenomenal realism—provide the argument. Currently the criticism amounts to 'heterophenomenology doesn't assume what we assume.'

### Issue 6: Quantum Claims Don't Follow From This Epistemology

- **Files**: All three articles (indirectly)
- **Location**: Throughout, especially introspection:149-155
- **Problem**: The introspection article claims first-person reports support No Many Worlds because 'introspective reports uniformly describe singular, determinate experiences.' But the articles also acknowledge introspection can't access causal processes—only content. If introspection can't access causal processes, it can't tell us whether experience results from collapse or decoherence. The singularity of reported experience is compatible with MWI (branch-relative singularity). The epistemological framework these articles develop doesn't support the quantum-interpretation claims the Map makes elsewhere.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Recommendation**: Either strengthen the connection (explain how first-person methods can access facts about quantum processes) or acknowledge the limit (introspection reveals experiential structure but can't adjudicate between physical interpretations of that structure). Currently the No Many Worlds support claimed in the introspection article exceeds what the epistemological framework established by the cluster can provide.

## Counterarguments to Address

### The Deflationary Explanation of the Gap

- **Current content says**: The persistent methodological gap between first-person and third-person approaches 'is best explained by ontological dualism.'
- **A critic would argue**: The gap is better explained by the complexity of studying recursive systems from inside. The brain studying itself faces unique challenges—not because brain and mind are ontologically distinct, but because the measuring instrument *is* the measured system. Similar methodological difficulties arise whenever a system models itself (Gödel, Turing). The gap may be epistemic/practical rather than ontological.
- **Suggested response**: The articles could engage this deflationary explanation directly. Why is the consciousness gap evidence for dualism when the Gödel gap isn't evidence for the irreducibility of mathematics to logic? What's distinctive about the consciousness case? Chalmers's argument about logical supervenience addresses this but isn't developed in these methodology articles.

### The Circularity of Training Validation

- **Current content says**: Trained contemplatives provide reliable phenomenological evidence because their reports predict neural correlates and converge across traditions.
- **A critic would argue**: Both validation criteria are third-person. If first-person evidence is irreducible to third-person evidence, why does first-person evidence need third-person validation? If first-person evidence doesn't need third-person validation, how do we distinguish genuine insight from shared delusion? The training argument seems either circular (first-person evidence validated by first-person reports that it's reliable) or self-undermining (first-person evidence actually validated by third-person convergence).
- **Suggested response**: Clarify the relationship between first-person methods and third-person validation. Perhaps first-person methods provide *different* evidence that happens to be corroborated by third-person methods. But then acknowledge this is methodological pluralism, not first-person primacy. The epistemological claims in these articles seem to oscillate between 'first-person methods are irreducible' and 'first-person methods are validated by third-person convergence.'

### The Buddhist Challenge to First-Person Perspective

- **Current content says**: First-person perspective provides access to phenomenal properties that third-person methods systematically miss.
- **A critic would argue**: Rigorous first-person investigation (Buddhist phenomenology) reveals that 'first-person perspective' is itself constructed, not primitive. There is no observer apart from the stream of observations; no experiencer apart from experiences. The very notion of 'first-person access' reifies what careful introspection deconstructs. If Buddhist phenomenology is reliable (as the Map's appeals to contemplative traditions suggest), it undermines the reified 'first-person' the articles presuppose.
- **Suggested response**: The articles briefly acknowledge this ('Buddhist phenomenology complicates this picture') but don't resolve it. Either argue that Buddhist phenomenology is unreliable in this domain, or explain how first-person epistemology survives the deconstruction of the first person. The introspection article's 'subject without substance' resolution is gestured at but not developed.

### The Self-Stultification Symmetry

- **Current content says**: Illusionism is self-undermining because if phenomenal consciousness is illusory, we can't trust our grasp of the illusionist argument.
- **A critic would argue**: The same argument applies symmetrically to dualism. If introspection can be wrong about causal processes, why can't it be wrong about the very existence of phenomenal properties? The dualist says we have direct access to phenomenal content; but what if that sense of 'direct access' is itself constructed? The self-stultification argument proves too much—or nothing at all.
- **Suggested response**: The articles could address this symmetry directly. What makes the dualist's introspective confidence in phenomenal properties different from the illusionist's intellectual grasp of the argument? Both rely on some form of cognitive access. If one is trustworthy and the other isn't, explain the difference.

## Unsupported Claims

| Claim | Location | Needed Support |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| "The persistent need for dual methodologies—first-person phenomenology alongside third-person neuroscience—is best explained by ontological dualism" | first-person:129 | This is abductive inference requiring comparison with alternatives. Why is dualism the *best* explanation rather than one explanation among several? |
| "Fox et al. (2012) demonstrated that meditation experience predicts introspective accuracy following a logarithmic learning curve" | phenomenological:60-61 | The study shows correlation, not causation. 'Learning curve' requires longitudinal data; this was cross-sectional. |
| "We are *acquainted* with phenomenal content—directly presented with what experience is like—without necessarily having *descriptive* knowledge of the processes producing it" | introspection:55-56 | The acquaintance/description distinction is asserted, not argued. What establishes that phenomenal access is acquaintance rather than another form of representation? |
| "Introspective reports uniformly describe singular, determinate experiences... This suggests consciousness involves collapse to definite outcomes" | introspection:155-156 | MWI also predicts singular reports (branch-relative singularity). Phenomenological singularity can't distinguish collapse from no-collapse interpretations. |
| "The choice isn't between perfect introspection and no introspection—it's between careful use of fallible methods and abandoning the only direct access to consciousness we have" | introspection:161 | This presupposes introspection provides 'direct access'—but that's the contested claim, not a premise. |
| "Phenomenological evidence is irreplaceable precisely because it describes what needs explaining" | phenomenological:33 | Third-person behavioral and neural evidence also describes what needs explaining. What makes phenomenological evidence *uniquely* irreplaceable? |

## Language Improvements

| Current | Issue | Suggested |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| "is best explained by ontological dualism" (first-person:129) | Presents contested inference as established | "provides evidence for ontological dualism, though alternative explanations remain" |
| "demonstrated that meditation experience predicts introspective accuracy" (phenomenological:60) | Overstates correlation study | "found correlation between meditation experience and introspective accuracy" |
| "the very need for phenomenological methodology—distinct from and irreducible to third-person neuroscience—reflects the irreducibility of consciousness" (phenomenological:129) | Assumes what it argues for | "the very need for phenomenological methodology suggests—though doesn't establish—the irreducibility of consciousness" |
| "heterophenomenology's methodological neutrality cannot be the final word on consciousness" (first-person:62) | Assumes dualist conclusion | "heterophenomenology's methodological neutrality leaves open questions the Map aims to address" |
| "phenomenal content access, though fallible, provides genuine evidence" (introspection:159) | 'Genuine' begs the question | "phenomenal content access, though fallible, provides evidence the Map treats as genuine" |
| "the explanatory gap's persistence... suggests the gap is in nature rather than merely in our current theories" (first-person:105) | Overstates abductive inference | "the explanatory gap's persistence is compatible with a gap in nature, though also with a gap in our current understanding" |

## Style Guide Observations

### Front-Loading
All three articles front-load effectively. First-person/third-person opens with the methodological divide and dualist interpretation. Phenomenological evidence opens with the evidential status question. Introspection opens with the reliability debate and the content/process distinction.

### Tenet Connections
All three have explicit 'Relation to Site Perspective' sections connecting to tenets. The connections are substantive—Dualism (methodological gap → ontological gap), Bidirectional Interaction (mutual constraint), Occam's Razor Has Limits (introspection difficulty ≠ unreality). However, the connections sometimes assume what the articles are meant to establish.

### Citation Quality
Strong citation practices throughout. Key sources: Dennett, Varela, Husserl, Nisbett & Wilson, Petitmengin, Fox et al., Chalmers, Levine. References sections are complete with publication details.

### Structural Coherence
The three articles form a coherent cluster: methodology establishes the first-person/third-person divide, phenomenological evidence specifies reliability criteria, introspection addresses the reliability debate directly. Cross-references link them appropriately.

### Named-Anchor Pattern
First-person/third-person uses named anchors for heterophenomenology (#heterophenomenology) and explanatory gap (#explanatory-gap). This supports forward-reference pattern in the writing style guide.

## Strengths (Brief)

Despite criticisms:

1. **Genuine philosophical engagement.** The articles engage seriously with opposing views (heterophenomenology, introspection critics, illusionism) rather than strawmanning. Dennett's view is presented fairly, not caricatured.

2. **Methodological specificity.** The phenomenological evidence article provides concrete reliability criteria (temporal stability, predictive power, structural coherence, theory independence, resistance to suggestion). This operationalizes claims that often remain vague.

3. **Honest about limits.** The introspection article acknowledges structural limits (unobservable self, error-blindness) that other treatments gloss over. The intellectual honesty strengthens credibility even if it creates tension with reliability claims.

4. **Historical depth.** The articles situate contemporary debates in their intellectual history (Husserl's epoché, Russell's acquaintance/description, James on introspection). This contextualizes the Map's position within ongoing philosophical conversation.

5. **Practical implications.** The phenomenological evidence article connects abstract methodology to concrete practices (microphenomenology, contemplative training). This makes the methodology actionable rather than purely theoretical.

6. **Internal coherence.** The three articles form a unified treatment of methodological foundations. Each addresses a distinct aspect (methodology, evidence, reliability) while connecting to the others through explicit cross-references.

The fundamental vulnerability: the cluster provides *epistemological foundations* for the Map's entire project. If the inference from methodological to ontological dualism fails, if training evidence is weaker than claimed, if the process/content distinction is ad hoc, the foundations are compromised. The articles are internally coherent but assume rather than argue for several key premises that critics would contest.
