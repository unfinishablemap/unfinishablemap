## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **"Sub-millisecond timescale" factual error (line 87)**: The article claimed constancy computations operate at "sub-millisecond timescale." No evidence supports this—chromatic adaptation operates on tens-of-milliseconds timescales, and ERP studies place colour categorisation at 100-200ms. **Resolution**: Replaced with "tens of milliseconds" and specified "retinal adaptation and lateral inhibition" as the relevant early processes.
- **Straw physicalism in core argument (lines 55-57)**: The article argued against physicalism by noting qualia should vary with retinal inputs if identical to "sensory transduction states." No serious physicalist identifies qualia with retinal states; they identify them with cortical representations. **Resolution**: Restructured the entire "Constancy as Evidence" section. Now explicitly acknowledges the physicalist cortical-representation response, then argues that stable cortical representations still face the hard problem. The inverted qualia argument follows as a deeper challenge.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing engagement with predictive processing**: The article mentioned "Bayesian accounts" in passing but did not engage with the dominant predictive processing framework. **Resolution**: Added a sentence in the Computational Account section introducing predictive processing with Clark (2013) and Hohwy (2013) citations.
- **Missing cross-links to closely related articles**: The article did not link to philosophy-of-perception-under-dualism (which extensively references this article), consciousness-and-temporal-integration, phenomenal-transparency, conscious-vs-unconscious-processing, or predictive-processing-and-the-maps-framework. **Resolution**: Added all five cross-links at natural insertion points throughout the text, plus four new entries in Further Reading.
- **Thermostat analogy begs the question**: Noted but preserved—the analogy illustrates the dualist position effectively for the target audience. The restructured core argument now makes the harder case directly, reducing dependence on the analogy.
- **No phenomenology of constancy breakdown**: The article claimed painters can break constancy but did not describe the experience. **Resolution**: Added a vivid phenomenological description of constancy breakdown (orange cast on candlelit walls, blue-violet shadows on snow, the instability when default reasserts).
- **300ms voluntary attention claim uncited**: The figure is well-established but the article's References section lacked attention literature. **Deferred**: The figure appears in the Map's own structure-of-attention article. Adding another citation was deprioritised given other changes.
- **"Orders of magnitude" imprecision**: Visible wavelengths span less than one order of magnitude. **Resolution**: Changed to "spectral composition differs enormously."
- **Palmer (1999) orphaned reference**: Listed in References but never cited in text. **Resolution**: Added inline citation where psychophysics findings are summarised.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Representationalist response**: Representationalism (Dretske, Tye) holds phenomenal character IS representational content. If constancy mechanisms produce stable representations, stable phenomenal character follows. The restructured core argument now addresses this by noting that stable cortical representations are still physical processes subject to the hard problem.
- **Predictive processing account**: Now acknowledged explicitly in the Computational Account section. The article notes that predictive processing explains the computational mechanism but not the phenomenal dimension.
- **"Just more computation" objection to attentional selection**: The distinction between computational speed and phenomenal continuity is preserved as evidence; deferred deeper engagement for future review.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- The thermostat analogy—isolates phenomenal dimension from computational achievement
- "The stability is not just computed; it is *undergone*"—precise, memorable formulation
- Husserlian adumbration analysis—"we see the circle *in* the trapezoid" is phenomenologically exact
- Concrete psychophysical examples (banana, door, coal) ground abstract argument
- Temporal dissociation argument (100ms computation vs. sustained phenomenal stability)
- Measured, cautious tenet connections—especially quantum interaction hedging

### Enhancements Made
- Restructured core argument to engage with real (not straw) physicalism
- Added vivid phenomenology of constancy breakdown
- Added predictive processing engagement with citations
- Added conscious/unconscious processing distinction
- Added phenomenal transparency cross-link at natural point
- Added temporal integration cross-link
- Added philosophy-of-perception-under-dualism cross-link
- Fixed spectral composition phrasing for precision
- Alphabetised and expanded References section

### Cross-links Added
- [philosophy-of-perception-under-dualism](/topics/philosophy-of-perception-under-dualism/)
- [predictive-processing-and-the-maps-framework](/topics/predictive-processing-and-the-maps-framework/)
- [phenomenal-transparency](/concepts/phenomenal-transparency/)
- [conscious-vs-unconscious-processing](/concepts/conscious-vs-unconscious-processing/)
- [consciousness-and-temporal-integration](/topics/temporal-structure-of-consciousness/)

## Remaining Items

- **300ms attention deployment citation**: The figure is correct and used in other Map articles but lacks a primary citation here. Low priority.
- **Blindsight and constancy**: The optimistic review identified this as a strong expansion opportunity—do blindsight patients exhibit computational constancy without phenomenal constancy? This would sharpen the dissociation argument. Deferred for future work.
- **What Would Challenge This View section**: The pessimistic review suggested adding an explicit falsifiability/challenge section. Deferred—the article is still below threshold and this could be added in a future review.
- **Meditator constancy shifts**: The claim that meditators can access the "machinery of constancy" lacks citation. Low priority but should eventually be supported or softened.

## Stability Notes

- The six adversarial personas all disagreed with the article's dualist conclusions, as expected. This is philosophical disagreement, not a flaw. The Eliminative Materialist and Hard-Nosed Physicalist raised the strongest objections (straw physicalism, thermostat question-begging); both were addressed. The Quantum Skeptic's concern about the sub-millisecond claim was the only genuine factual error. The Empiricist's unfalsifiability concern and the Buddhist's challenge to the stability of phenomenal properties are bedrock philosophical disagreements that future reviews should not re-flag as critical.
