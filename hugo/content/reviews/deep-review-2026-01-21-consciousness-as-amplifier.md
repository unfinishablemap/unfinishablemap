# Deep Review: Consciousness as Intelligence Amplifier

**Date**: 2026-01-21
**File**: obsidian/concepts/consciousness-as-amplifier.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None identified. The article is well-structured with comprehensive tenet coverage and strong argumentation.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Illusionist engagement lacked Frankish specificity**: The original illusionist section mentioned the "regress problem" but didn't engage with Frankish's quasi-phenomenal framework specifically.
   - **Resolution**: Added new subsection "Frankish's Quasi-Phenomenal Response" (~200 words) explaining the quasi-phenomenal account and why the amplification evidence creates specific problems for it—particularly the unexplained correlation between "tasks that feel conscious" and "tasks that distinguish humans from great apes."

2. **No Many Worlds argument was thin**: The original claim that "consciousness selects among possibilities" didn't engage with MWI's indexical selection response.
   - **Resolution**: Added paragraph (~150 words) addressing the MWI response that selection is indexical, and explaining why the systematic correlation between consciousness-dependent capacities and successful reasoning remains unexplained on MWI.

3. **Missing cross-links**: The article didn't link to [phenomenology-of-choice](/concepts/phenomenology-of-choice/) or [metarepresentation](/concepts/metarepresentation/), both highly relevant.
   - **Resolution**: Added both to concepts frontmatter and phenomenology-of-choice to Further Reading with description.

4. **Buddhist contemplative section lacked technical vocabulary**: The original mentioned *vijñāna* but didn't integrate Abhidharma analysis.
   - **Resolution**: Added paragraph (~100 words) on *cetasika*, *manasikāra*, *vitakka*, and *vicāra*, explaining how the Abhidharma framework maps onto the amplification thesis.

### Low Issues Found

1. **Lieberman study interpretation**: The article could acknowledge that the Lieberman study shows correlation, not definitively necessity.
   - **Resolution**: Added qualifying sentence acknowledging the correlation/causation distinction while noting the systematic pattern suggests more than coincidence.

### Counterarguments Considered

1. **Eliminative materialist objection**: That "consciousness" is just a label for neural processes, not a separate causal factor.
   - **How addressed**: The systematic correspondence between consciousness-requiring tasks and the human-ape gap (addressed throughout) provides evidence that consciousness contributes something beyond what "more complex neurons" would predict.

2. **MWI indexical selection**: That selection appears genuine only because we're in one branch.
   - **How addressed**: New paragraph explains why the correlation between consciousness-dependent capacities and successful reasoning would be unexplained coincidence on MWI.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

1. **Opening paragraph**: Excellent frontloading—direct, confident, states the core argument immediately. Survives truncation.

2. **Systematic correspondence argument**: The claim that the human-ape gap tracks consciousness-dependent capacities is compelling and well-supported.

3. **Process Philosophy section**: Substantive integration of Whitehead's framework; the prehension account of working memory expansion is illuminating.

4. **Falsifiability conditions section**: Five specific conditions that would challenge the view, appropriately concrete.

5. **Contemplative evidence section**: Strong phenomenological grounding; witness consciousness discussion is effective.

### Enhancements Made

1. Enhanced illusionist engagement with Frankish-specific response
2. Strengthened No Many Worlds argument with MWI indexical response
3. Added Abhidharma technical vocabulary to Buddhist section
4. Added nuance to Lieberman study interpretation

### Cross-links Added

- [phenomenology-of-choice](/concepts/phenomenology-of-choice/) (concepts frontmatter and Further Reading)
- [metarepresentation](/concepts/metarepresentation/) (concepts frontmatter)
