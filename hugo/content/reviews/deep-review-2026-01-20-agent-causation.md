**Date**: 2026-01-20
**Article**: [Agent Causation](/concepts/agent-causation/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None critical; article was already well-structured

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing falsifiability section**: No "What Would Challenge This View?" section existed. [Resolution: Added comprehensive falsifiability section with six testable conditions]
- **Decoherence objection not addressed**: Article invoked quantum Zeno mechanism without engaging Tegmark's decoherence timescale objection. [Resolution: Added "The Decoherence Challenge" subsection addressing this directly]
- **Illusionist response unengaged**: Phenomenology of effort argument vulnerable to illusionist counter. [Resolution: Added paragraph engaging illusionism and noting self-stultification problem]
- **Missing cross-links**: Pairing problem, many-worlds, downward-causation, mental-causation not linked despite direct relevance. [Resolution: Added all four to concepts frontmatter and Further Reading]

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist**: "Consciousness" may not be a natural kind; folk psychology categories may be eliminable. [Response: Article already frames consciousness non-reductively; this is a broader disagreement about dualism]
- **Quantum skeptic**: Decoherence timescales rule out quantum effects. [Response: Added subsection addressing this]
- **Many-worlds defender**: If all outcomes occur, there's no selection. [Response: Added cross-link to many-worlds article; site's rejection of MWI is foundational]
- **Buddhist philosopher**: What grounds the "substance" exercising causal powers? [Response: Added Whitehead process philosophy section offering alternative metaphysical framing]

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Two-domain convergence argument (attention + motor selection)
- Kane's 2024 evolution treatment
- Phenomenology of directing vs being captured distinction
- Creative generation section (Bergson, Boden, Hausman)
- Skill delegation and choking phenomenon evidence

### Enhancements Made
1. **New "What Would Challenge This View?" section**: Six falsifiability conditions covering neural prediction, quantum effects, effort-outcome correlation, willed/instructed distinction, hard problem, and many-worlds
2. **New "The Decoherence Challenge" subsection**: Addresses Tegmark's objection directly, notes quantum biology counter-evidence
3. **New illusionism engagement**: Paragraph addressing illusionist response to phenomenology argument
4. **New "Process Philosophy and Actual Occasions" subsection**: Whitehead's panexperientialism as complementary perspective
5. **New pairing problem connection**: Links agent causation to spatial location at interface

### Cross-links Added
- [many-worlds](/concepts/many-worlds/)
- [pairing-problem](/concepts/pairing-problem/)
- [downward-causation](/concepts/downward-causation/)
- [mental-causation](/concepts/mental-causation/)
- [decoherence](/concepts/decoherence/)
