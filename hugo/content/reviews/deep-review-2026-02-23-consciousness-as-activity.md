title: Deep Review - Consciousness as Activity Rather Than Property
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-23
**Article**: [Consciousness as Activity Rather Than Property](/topics/consciousness-as-activity/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Whirlpool analogy supports materialism if taken at face value**: The whirlpool IS reducible to fluid dynamics, so the analogy inadvertently suggests consciousness is reducible to neural activity. **Resolution**: Added explicit caveat paragraph acknowledging the analogy's limits and explaining why consciousness-as-activity makes a stronger irreducibility claim.

2. **Missing Tenet 2 (Minimal Quantum Interaction) in Relation to Site Perspective**: Only four of five tenets were connected. **Resolution**: Added paragraph connecting the activity framing to the quantum interaction tenet — consciousness biases quantum outcomes as something it *does*, not a force it *exerts*.

3. **Nagel not credited for "something it is like"**: The phrasing was attributed solely to Chalmers's formulation. **Resolution**: Reworded to credit both Nagel's "something it is like" and Chalmers's hard problem.

4. **Sciences section underdeveloped**: Four frameworks name-dropped without citations or substantive engagement. **Resolution**: Added specific citations (Clark 2013/2016 for predictive processing, Dehaene & Changeux 2011 for global workspace, strengthened enactivism paragraph with Noë and embodied cognition link).

5. **References outdated**: All pre-2010, no recent cognitive science despite claiming alignment. **Resolution**: Added Clark (2013), Clark (2016), Dehaene & Changeux (2011), and Nagel (1974).

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Churchland/Eliminativist**: Whirlpool analogy cuts for materialism; activities don't require non-physical agents. Addressed via caveat on analogy limits; agent-dependence argument preserved as a philosophical commitment, not a deduction from the analogy.
- **Dennett/Physicalist**: Predictive processing, enactivism etc. are materialist theories being co-opted. Acknowledged by noting these frameworks are "activity-first" without claiming they entail dualism — the article uses them to show the activity category is scientifically productive, then argues separately for irreducibility.
- **Nagarjuna/Buddhist**: Activity framing reifies a substantial self. Not addressed in text — this is a bedrock philosophical disagreement between Buddhist non-self and the Map's commitment to agent-causation.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening paragraph with memorable dancing-to-legs analogy
- Four ontological commitments (temporal constitution, agent-dependence, causal engagement, irreducibility of practice) — well-structured and original
- Philosophical roots section — efficient engagement with Whitehead, Bergson, James
- Hard problem reframing with four candidate features
- Strong tenet connections (especially Dualism and Bidirectional Interaction)
- Bold-keyword paragraph structure in "What Activity Means Here" — clear and scannable

### Enhancements Made
- Whirlpool caveat paragraph — addresses the strongest materialist objection head-on
- Tenet 2 connection — completes all five tenet mappings
- Sciences section substantially strengthened with citations and conceptual engagement
- Nagel properly credited
- References expanded from 7 to 11 entries spanning 1889-2016

### Cross-links Added
- [embodied-cognition](/concepts/embodied-cognition/)
- [predictive-processing](/concepts/predictive-processing/)
- [downward-causation](/concepts/downward-causation/)
- [consciousness-and-agency](/apex/consciousness-and-agency/)

## Remaining Items

None. All medium issues addressed. The article is now well-rounded at 2158 words, comfortably within the 3000-word soft threshold for topics.

## Stability Notes

- The Buddhist non-self objection (Nagarjuna) represents a bedrock disagreement with the Map's agent-causation commitment. Future reviews should NOT re-flag this as critical — it is an expected philosophical standoff.
- The materialist objection that activity frameworks (predictive processing, enactivism) don't entail dualism is acknowledged. The article uses these frameworks to motivate the activity category, not to derive dualism from them. This separation is deliberate and should be preserved.
- The MWI argument ("activities cannot be copied without becoming different activities") in the tenet section is thin but philosophically defensible as an intuition pump. Strengthening it further risks overcomplicating a section that works at its current depth.
