# Deep Review: Baseline Cognition

**Date**: 2026-01-29
**File**: obsidian/concepts/baseline-cognition.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-27
**Context**: Cross-review considering counterfactual-reasoning insights

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Six adversarial personas reviewed the document with attention to the newly published counterfactual-reasoning article:

### Eliminative Materialist (Churchland)
- The baseline/conscious distinction presupposes phenomenal consciousness does real work
- *Assessment*: Previously addressed in illusionism section with argument from reason; opening now explicitly distinguishes phenomenal from access consciousness

### Hard-Nosed Physicalist (Dennett)
- Procedural/declarative distinction could be reframed as functional differences without invoking phenomenal states
- *Assessment*: Bedrock disagreement; illusionism section provides the Map's response but won't satisfy committed functionalists

### Quantum Skeptic (Tegmark)
- Quantum mechanisms appropriately hedged ("doesn't require quantum mechanisms")
- *Assessment*: No issues

### Many-Worlds Defender (Deutsch)
- The "settling" argument in the tenet connection remains a philosophical standoff
- *Assessment*: N/A (fundamental disagreement about what selection means, not a fixable flaw)

### Empiricist (Popper)
- Lieberman et al. appropriately hedged; De Neys citation provides convergent evidence
- *Assessment*: Low; hedging appropriate

### Buddhist Philosopher (Nagarjuna)
- Contemplative Perspectives section engages substantively with vijñāna/cetasika distinction
- *Assessment*: No issues; appropriately nuanced about consciousness admitting degrees/kinds

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article has been reviewed three times previously and critical issues were resolved.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Cross-reference to counterfactual-reasoning**: The "Counterfactual Thinking" section lacked a link to the newly published [counterfactual-reasoning](/concepts/counterfactual-reasoning/) article, which provides substantial elaboration on this theme.
   - *Resolution*: Added cross-link and tightened prose for length-neutral integration

### Counterarguments Considered
All major counterarguments (epiphenomenalism, illusionism) remain adequately addressed from prior reviews.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

Six sympathetic personas reviewed with attention to integration opportunities from counterfactual-reasoning:

### Property Dualist (Chalmers)
- Opening clearly distinguishes phenomenal from access consciousness
- Systematic correspondence argument between consciousness-requiring capacities and human-ape gap is well-articulated

### Quantum Mind Theorist (Stapp)
- Appropriately cautious about quantum mechanisms while preserving the option

### Phenomenologist (Nagel)
- "Experience without experiencing that they experience" remains a strong phenomenological formulation
- The procedural/declarative distinction captures the phenomenological difference effectively

### Process Philosopher (Whitehead)
- Contemplative Perspectives section engages Whitehead's "high-grade occasions" substantively

### Libertarian Free Will Defender (Kane)
- Free will implications section explicit about counterfactual reasoning's role
- The newly published counterfactual-reasoning article strengthens this thread significantly

### Mysterian (McGinn)
- Appropriate epistemic humility about mechanisms while maintaining substantive claims

### Strengths Preserved
- Core hypothesis articulation in opening paragraph
- Domain-by-domain evidence structure (tool use, social reasoning, metacognition)
- Clear procedural/declarative tables
- All five tenet connections in Relation to Site Perspective
- Illusionism and epiphenomenalism challenge sections

### Enhancements Made
- Added [counterfactual-reasoning](/concepts/counterfactual-reasoning/) to concepts frontmatter
- Added cross-link in Counterfactual Thinking section with introductory context
- Added entry in Further Reading section
- Tightened prose in Counterfactual Thinking section to maintain length neutrality

### Cross-links Added
- [counterfactual-reasoning](/concepts/counterfactual-reasoning/) — now linked from Counterfactual Thinking section and Further Reading

## Length Check

**Before**: 3296 words (132% of 2500 soft threshold)
**After**: 3301 words (132% of 2500 soft threshold)
**Status**: Soft warning (below hard threshold of 3500)

Operated in length-neutral mode: cross-link addition balanced by tightening prose in same section. Minimal net change (+5 words).

## Remaining Items

None. This cross-review confirms the article's stability while integrating the new counterfactual-reasoning content appropriately.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed four times (2026-01-22, 2026-01-25, 2026-01-27, 2026-01-29). The article is stable with no critical issues. This cross-review added integration with the newly published counterfactual-reasoning article.

Key philosophical disagreements noted in prior reviews remain bedrock standoffs:

- **MWI proponents** will find the "settling" argument unsatisfying—this reflects fundamental disagreement about what selection means
- **Eliminative materialists** object that "consciousness" may not carve nature at joints—the illusionism response addresses this but cannot resolve ontological disagreements
- **Hard physicalists** can always retreat to "functional all the way down"—the argument from reason provides the Map's response

The counterfactual-reasoning article now provides a dedicated treatment of the consciousness-requirement for counterfactual thinking that baseline-cognition references; future reviews should verify this bidirectional integration remains coherent.
