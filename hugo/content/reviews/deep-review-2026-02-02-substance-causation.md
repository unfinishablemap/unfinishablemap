title: Deep Review - Substance Causation
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Article**: [Substance Causation](/concepts/agent-causation/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Incorrect citation**: O'Connor (2021) referenced for neo-Aristotelian agent causation work, but the actual source is Jacobs & O'Connor (2013). Resolution: Corrected to "Jonathan Jacobs and Timothy O'Connor's work (2013)" and updated references section.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Apparent contradiction "uncaused events caused by agent"**: Could sound self-contradictory. Resolution: Clarified to "uncaused by events" with explanation that agent-causes are distinct from event-causes.
- **No mention of decoherence challenge**: Quantum claims needed acknowledgment of the decoherence objection. Resolution: Added paragraph acknowledging decoherence and linking to Map's treatment.
- **Falsifiability concern not addressed**: Resolution: Added response in Challenges section explaining that metaphysical frameworks are evaluated by explanatory power and fit with data, not unique predictions.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Substances may reduce to event patterns** (Dennett-style critique): Not directly addressed—the article presents Lowe's argument that the reverse reduction fails. This is a bedrock philosophical disagreement.
- **Decoherence eliminates quantum gaps**: Now acknowledged with link to Map's response.
- **What would falsify substance causation?**: Now addressed in new paragraph.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear front-loaded thesis establishing substance causation's role in the Map's framework
- Elegant dissolution of the "anomaly" objection (consciousness causing things is same type as all causation)
- Phenomenological sensitivity ("When you act, *you* cause the action")
- Strong historical context (Aristotle through Lowe and contemporary neo-Aristotelians)
- Epistemic humility about what substance causation doesn't solve
- Comprehensive Relation to Site Perspective section connecting multiple tenets

### Enhancements Made
- Clarified Lowe's technical distinction between event-causes and agent-causes
- Added acknowledgment of decoherence challenge with links to Map's response
- Added response to falsifiability concern
- Corrected Jacobs & O'Connor citation

### Cross-links Added
- [decoherence](/concepts/decoherence/)
- [quantum-decoherence-objection](/concepts/decoherence/)

## Remaining Items

None. All critical and medium issues addressed.

## Stability Notes

Several philosophical disagreements identified are bedrock disputes, not fixable problems:

- **Eliminativist challenge**: Folk psychology may be eliminable—but the Map explicitly endorses consciousness as irreducible (Dualism tenet), so this is a tenet-level disagreement.
- **MWI challenge**: The argument assumes single quantum outcomes, which MWI denies. The Map explicitly rejects MWI (No Many Worlds tenet), so this is acknowledged.
- **Substance/event priority dispute**: Whether substances reduce to event patterns or vice versa is a fundamental metaphysical disagreement that won't be resolved by further editing.

Future reviews should not re-flag these as critical issues requiring fixes.
