title: Deep Review - Prehension
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-14
**Article**: [Prehension](/concepts/prehension/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Broken wikilink `[phenomenal-unity](/concepts/phenomenal-binding-and-holism/)`**: No such file exists. Replaced with `[phenomenal-binding-and-holism](/concepts/phenomenal-binding-and-holism/)` in both frontmatter and Further Reading section.
- **Attribution imprecision**: Article stated Whitehead called prehensions "feelings" without qualification. Corrected: Whitehead called *positive* prehensions "feelings" (*Process and Reality*, Part III); negative prehensions are "eliminations." Added citation reference.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Panpsychism tension**: Article used prehension sympathetically while claiming Map doesn't adopt panpsychism, without explaining the selective borrowing. Resolution: Added a paragraph in Relation to Site Perspective explicitly addressing the tension and justifying the Map's restricted use of prehension's relational structure.
- **Eliminativist "vocabulary inflation" critique underengaged**: The Criticisms section acknowledged explanatory opacity but didn't address the materialist challenge directly. Resolution: Added eliminative materialist objection that neural causation is all prehension describes, with the response that prehension has value only if it illuminates structure causal language misses.
- **Missing concrete example**: Article was entirely abstract. Resolution: Added melody example after opening summary illustrating prehension in everyday auditory experience.
- **Combination problem circularity**: Article admits the response to the unity objection may be circular. Deferred — this is an honest acknowledgment rather than a fixable flaw.
- **Concrescence/collapse parallel undergrounded**: The structural parallel is asserted speculatively. Retained with appropriate hedging ("speculates," "may reflect"). This is the Map's distinctive contribution, not a factual claim.
- **Buddhist non-reification critique unaddressed**: A Madhyamaka Buddhist would challenge reification of process itself. Deferred — adding this would require expanding a section already adequately balanced.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist (Churchland)**: Prehension as vocabulary inflation over neuroscience. Addressed in expanded Criticisms.
- **Hard-nosed physicalist (Dennett)**: Prehension reifies the intentional stance. Noted but not separately addressed — overlaps with explanatory opacity criticism already present.
- **Quantum skeptic (Tegmark)**: Concrescence/collapse parallel lacks mathematical formalization. The article's hedging ("speculates," "may") is appropriate.
- **Many-Worlds defender (Deutsch)**: Prehension's dependence on collapse begs the question against MWI. The No Many Worlds tenet section addresses this directly.
- **Empiricist (Popper)**: Unfalsifiable metaphysics. Addressed by existing "Empirical untestability" criticism.
- **Buddhist (Nagarjuna)**: Process-reification. Deferred for future review.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent opening summary: direct, front-loaded, clear
- Strong etymological grounding ("prehendere," "concrescere")
- Honest, balanced Criticisms section
- Clear tenet connections in Relation to Site Perspective
- Good cross-linking to related concepts (process-philosophy, panpsychism, intentionality, etc.)
- Active voice throughout most of the article
- Autonoetic consciousness connection (memory as re-prehension)

### Enhancements Made
- Added concrete melody example for accessibility
- Clarified "feelings" attribution to positive prehensions with Process and Reality citation
- Added "vacuous actuality" citation to Process and Reality preface
- Expanded Relation to Site Perspective with explicit justification for selective borrowing from panpsychist framework
- Strengthened eliminativist engagement in Criticisms
- Added `[causal-closure](/concepts/causal-closure/)` cross-link in Further Reading

### Cross-links Added
- [causal-closure](/concepts/causal-closure/)
- [phenomenal-binding-and-holism](/concepts/phenomenal-binding-and-holism/) (replacing broken [phenomenal-unity](/concepts/phenomenal-binding-and-holism/))

## Remaining Items

- Buddhist non-reification critique could be addressed in a future review
- Combination problem circularity is honestly acknowledged but unresolved — this reflects genuine philosophical difficulty, not a writing flaw
- Intentionality section could be expanded to compare Brentano vs. Whitehead on directedness

## Stability Notes

The six adversarial personas raise objections that are largely expected philosophical disagreements rather than fixable problems:

- MWI defenders will always find prehension's dependence on definite outcomes question-begging — this is a bedrock disagreement between collapse and no-collapse interpretations.
- Eliminative materialists will always reject process vocabulary as redundant over neuroscience — this reflects the materialist/non-materialist divide, not a flaw in exposition.
- Empiricists will always flag metaphysical categories as untestable — the article already acknowledges this honestly.
- The panpsychism tension is now explicitly addressed rather than papered over, but process philosophers who insist on universal prehension will reject the Map's restriction. This is a principled disagreement, not an error.
