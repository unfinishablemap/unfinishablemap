title: Deep Review - The Metaphysics of Information Under Dualism
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-03-01
**Article**: [The Metaphysics of Information Under Dualism](/concepts/metaphysics-of-information-under-dualism/)
**Previous review**: [2026-02-23](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-23-metaphysics-of-information-under-dualism/)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. Second review confirms article stability. All attributions remain accurate (Shannon 1948, Chalmers 1996, Landauer 1961, Zheng & Meister 2025). No internal contradictions. All required sections present and substantive.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing cross-links to intentionality and symbol-grounding-problem**: The syntax-semantics section discusses meaning and aboutness without linking to the site's dedicated articles on these topics → Added inline links to [intentionality](/concepts/intentionality/) and [symbol-grounding-problem](/concepts/symbol-grounding-problem/) in the syntax-semantics section, and added both to concepts frontmatter.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Dennett's functionalist objection** (understanding IS complex information processing): Previous review noted the thermostat argument addresses this. No change needed — the hard problem article develops this fully.
- **Decoherence challenge**: Already addressed in previous review with cross-links. No re-flagging.
- **Empirical testability**: "Information as interface medium" vs "information is physical" remains empirically underdetermined. Acknowledged in previous review as applying to all four options equally.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening paragraph front-loading the core question
- Four-option taxonomy treating each position fairly
- Translator analogy ("neither French nor English")
- Syntax-semantics divide as the article's strongest philosophical contribution
- Epistemic vs ontological indeterminacy distinction in causal exclusion section
- "What Information Cannot Be" section — clean constraints
- All five tenets addressed substantively with specific informational consequences
- Zheng & Meister 10 bits/s finding as empirical constraint on interface bandwidth

### Enhancements Made
- Added cross-links to [intentionality](/concepts/intentionality/) and [symbol-grounding-problem](/concepts/symbol-grounding-problem/) in the syntax-semantics section, connecting the abstract syntax-semantics argument to the Map's concrete treatments of these problems
- Added both concepts to frontmatter

### Cross-links Added (Orphan Integration — Primary Focus)

## Remaining Items

None. The article is stable and now well-integrated into the site's navigation network.

## Stability Notes

This is the second deep review. The first (2026-02-23) found no critical issues and made targeted refinements (decoherence acknowledgment, 10 bits/s context, cross-links). This second review confirms stability — no critical issues, no medium issues requiring structural change.

The adversarial personas' objections remain bedrock philosophical disagreements: eliminative materialists reject dualism; functionalists dispute the syntax-semantics gap; quantum skeptics challenge the mechanism; MWI defenders reject collapse. These are expected standoffs given the Map's tenet commitments, not article-specific flaws.

The article's primary weakness was orphan status (no inbound links). This review addressed it by adding 10 inbound cross-references from the most thematically relevant articles across the site. Future reviews should not need to revisit this — the article is now well-connected.

Word count: 2085 → 2113 (+28 words, from two added sentences in the syntax-semantics section).
