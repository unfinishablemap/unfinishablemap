title: Deep Review - Illusionism
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-01-20
**Article**: [Illusionism](/concepts/illusionism/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Missing falsifiability section**: Established pattern from recent deep reviews not present → Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section with four testable conditions
- **No process philosophy engagement**: Whitehead's actual occasions missing → Added "Process Philosophy Challenge" subsection

### Medium Issues Found
- **Regress objection underdeveloped**: Could better engage with Frankish's response about functional seeming → Noted but preserved original strength
- **No introspection connection**: Missing link to introspection reliability literature → Added cross-link and brief discussion
- **No mysterianism connection**: Cognitive closure as alternative explanation missing → Added "The Mysterian Alternative" section
- **No knowledge argument integration**: Mary's Room implications for illusionism unexplored → Added "Connection to the Knowledge Argument" section
- **Current state outdated**: Missing PhilPapers survey data and recent debates → Updated with 2020 survey and recent focus areas

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative Materialist**: Frankish's response that "seeming" can be purely functional deserves more engagement → Noted in introspection discussion
- **Mysterian**: Illusionism as predictable response to cognitive closure → Added dedicated section
- **Process Philosophy**: Whitehead's challenge that experience is fundamental → Added dedicated section

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear distinction between big and small illusionism (Graziano)
- Strong coverage of AST as neuroscientific mechanism
- Effective presentation of the infinite regress objection
- Good integration of Frankish's response
- Well-structured relation to site tenets

### Enhancements Made
- Added "The Mysterian Alternative" section presenting cognitive closure interpretation
- Added "Process Philosophy Challenge" section with Whitehead's actual occasions
- Added "Connection to the Knowledge Argument" section on Mary's Room implications
- Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section with four falsifiability conditions
- Updated "Current State of the Debate" with survey data and recent research questions
- Enhanced references with full citations

### Cross-links Added
- `[introspection](/concepts/introspection/)` — reliability of phenomenal reports
- `[mysterianism](/concepts/mysterianism/)` — cognitive closure as alternative explanation
- `[knowledge-argument](/concepts/knowledge-argument/)` — Mary's Room and learning
- `[arguments-against-materialism](/concepts/arguments-against-materialism/)` — illusionism as physicalist response
