title: Deep Review - Galilean Exclusion
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-21
**Article**: [Galilean Exclusion](/concepts/galilean-exclusion/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Thompson citation imprecision**: The original text attributed a specific Galilean argument to Thompson's *Mind in Life* (2007), but the most explicit articulation appears in his later *The Blind Spot* (2024, with Frank and Gleiser). Resolution: Broadened the attribution to reference Thompson's work across both texts and added Husserl as the originator of the critique.
- **No acknowledgment that methodology has evolved**: The article implied the Galilean framework is static, ignoring that cognitive neuroscience incorporates subjective reports. Resolution: Added a paragraph addressing the functionalist/cognitive science objection and explaining why it operates within, rather than transcends, the Galilean framework.

### Low Issues Found
- Functionalist could argue the exclusion succeeded because secondary qualities *are* higher-level descriptions of physical facts. Deferred — the article now links to [functionalism](/arguments/functionalism/) and addresses the objection briefly. A full response belongs in the functionalism article.
- Empiricist could charge the thesis with unfalsifiability (what would count as materialist success?). Deferred — the article's balanced conclusion already acknowledges the hard problem is "no less real" regardless of its source.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist**: Science has evolved beyond Galileo; cognitive neuroscience uses subjective data. Response added: subjective reports enter as third-person data *about* experience, not experience itself.
- **Functionalist**: The exclusion worked because secondary qualities are functional states. Partially addressed via cross-link to functionalism article.
- **Empiricist**: The thesis risks unfalsifiability. Low priority — the article makes a structural/historical claim, not an empirical prediction.

## Attribution Accuracy Check

- Galileo's *Assayer* (1623), feather/tickling analogy: **Verified accurate**
- Descartes's *res extensa*/*res cogitans*: **Accurate**, with note that primary/secondary terminology came from Boyle and Locke (added to article)
- Chalmers's hard problem formulation from *The Conscious Mind* (1996): **Verified accurate** (faithful paraphrase)
- Thompson's Galilean critique: **Broadened** to cite both *Mind in Life* (2007) and *The Blind Spot* (2024), with Husserl as originator
- No misattributions, dropped qualifiers, overstated positions, source/Map conflation, or self-contradictions found

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- The "Not a Discovery but a Decision" section — the article's strongest and most distinctive contribution
- The sieve metaphor — memorable and effective
- Balanced conclusion cutting against both materialism and mysterianism
- Clean separation between historical exposition and Map interpretation
- Strong opening summary that survives truncation

### Enhancements Made
- Added Husserl's *Crisis of European Sciences* as philosophical predecessor (the most important articulation of this critique)
- Added Whitehead's "bifurcation of nature" as related concept from process philosophy
- Added paragraph addressing the functionalist/cognitive science objection
- Added historical note on Boyle/Locke terminology for primary/secondary qualities
- Broadened Thompson citation for accuracy

### Cross-links Added
- [functionalism](/arguments/functionalism/) — added to body text, frontmatter, and Further Reading
- [process-philosophy](/concepts/process-philosophy/) — added to body text, frontmatter, and Further Reading

### New References Added
- Husserl, E. (1936/1970). *The Crisis of European Sciences*
- Frank, A., Gleiser, M., & Thompson, E. (2024). *The Blind Spot*
- Whitehead, A. N. (1925). *Science and the Modern World*

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues were addressed.

## Stability Notes

- The adversarial personas' philosophical disagreements with the article's dualist position are expected and not fixable. The eliminative materialist will always object that science has moved beyond Galileo; the functionalist will always argue that the exclusion reveals rather than hides. These are bedrock disagreements, not article flaws.
- The article makes a structural/historical argument rather than an empirical claim, so the empiricist's unfalsifiability concern is a category issue rather than a genuine weakness.
