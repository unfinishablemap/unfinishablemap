**Date**: 2026-01-25
**Article**: [Conservation Laws and Mind-Brain Causation](/topics/conservation-laws-and-mind/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Six adversarial philosopher personas examined the article:

### Critical Issues Found

1. **No engagement with Tegmark's decoherence objection**: The article mentioned decoherence but didn't address Tegmark's specific calculations showing decoherence times far too short for neural processes.
   - *Resolution*: Added detailed discussion of Tegmark (2000), the Hagan et al. (2002) response, and explicit engagement with the decoherence timescale problem.

2. **Misleading entanglement analogy**: The original analogy suggested entanglement involves "selection" like consciousness would—but entanglement produces correlations deterministically without any selector.
   - *Resolution*: Replaced with "Causation Without Energy Transfer" section using boundary conditions and chaotic systems as more accurate analogies.

3. **Unfalsifiability dismissed too casually**: The original response to "any selection mechanism would be detectable" was special pleading.
   - *Resolution*: Rewrote to acknowledge the genuine methodological challenge honestly, noting that compatibility ≠ proof and the positive case comes from philosophical arguments.

4. **No acknowledgment of MWI**: The article assumed collapse without noting that many-worlds interpretation eliminates the causal gap entirely.
   - *Resolution*: Added new objection/response section on MWI, linking to the No Many Worlds tenet.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **"Something determines" framing begs the question**: Assuming outcomes need a "determiner" loads the dice.
   - *Resolution*: Added acknowledgment that whether a determiner is needed "is itself contested" and instrumentalists may deny explanation is required.

2. **Collins reference lacked academic credentials**: Source was "New Dualism Archive" without clarification.
   - *Resolution*: Clarified as "Unpublished manuscript" to set appropriate expectations.

### Counterarguments Considered

1. **MWI eliminates need for collapse**: Addressed with new section explaining Map's independent reasons for rejecting MWI.

2. **Tegmark's decoherence calculations**: Addressed with Hagan et al. response and clarification that selection doesn't require sustained coherence.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

Six sympathetic philosopher personas identified strengths:

### Strengths Preserved

- **Opening summary**: Excellent front-loading of key claim about conservation objections resting on misunderstandings—left unchanged
- **"Selection not injection" framework**: The article's distinctive contribution—preserved throughout
- **Objections-and-responses structure**: Effective pedagogical format—maintained and expanded
- **Epistemic humility**: Article appropriately distinguishes what it proves from what it doesn't—strengthened
- **Noether's theorem explanation**: Clear and accurate—preserved

### Enhancements Made

- Added explicit engagement with decoherence objection (Tegmark 2000, Hagan 2002)
- Added new MWI objection/response section
- Improved honesty about unfalsifiability concern
- Better philosophical framing of "what determines outcomes" question
- Added Tegmark and Hagan references

### Cross-links Added

- [decoherence](/concepts/decoherence/) (added to concepts)
- [explanatory-gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/) (added to concepts)
- [quantum-decoherence-objection](/concepts/decoherence/) (added to related articles)

## Remaining Items

None. All critical and medium issues addressed. The article is now more philosophically honest about its limitations while maintaining its core argument that the conservation objection fails.
