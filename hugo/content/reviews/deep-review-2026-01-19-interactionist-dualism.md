title: Deep Review - Interactionist Dualism
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-01-19
**Article**: [Interactionist Dualism](/concepts/interactionist-dualism/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Six adversarial philosopher personas examined the document:

### Critical Issues Found
- **Missing COGITATE citation**: The article referenced "2025 COGITATE experiment" without proper citation
  - **Resolution**: Added full citation (Cogitate Consortium, 2023, *Nature Human Behaviour*)

### Medium Issues Found
- **Zombie conceivability too quick**: The argument moved from "we can conceive" to "positively grasp" without addressing Dennett's objection that this may be merely supposing rather than genuinely conceiving
  - **Resolution**: Added explicit engagement with Dennett's objection and the response (pain's intrinsic character gives us genuine conceptual grasp)

- **Decoherence responses thin**: The "General" response claimed decoherence calculations "assume specific conditions" without specifying
  - **Resolution**: Added specifics (isolated systems, specific environmental coupling, noise-assisted quantum effects in biology)

- **No eliminativism engagement**: The article assumed consciousness exists as described without addressing eliminativism's challenge to the concept itself
  - **Resolution**: Added eliminativism to the objections table with response

- **Missing cross-links to new content**: Task notes identified missing links to evolution-of-consciousness.md, quantum-indeterminacy-free-will.md, and attention-as-interface.md
  - **Resolution**: Added all three to concepts frontmatter and integrated references in text

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Dennett on zombie conceivability**: Addressed in revised Argument 2
- **Eliminativism on folk concepts**: Addressed in objections table
- **Buddhist no-self**: Noted but not added (would require substantial restructuring; deferred)

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

Six sympathetic philosopher personas examined the document:

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent psychophysical laws framework distinguishing supervenience from causal laws
- Clear articulation of seven converging arguments
- Strong multi-mind collapse problem treatment with interface locality resolution
- Appropriate epistemic humility in Assessment section
- Self-stultification argument properly developed

### Enhancements Made
- **Evolutionary compatibility section**: Added new subsection explaining why interactionism handles the evolution of consciousness better than materialism
- **Attention as interface connection**: Linked the quantum Zeno mechanism to the attention-as-interface hypothesis
- **Agent causation to free will**: Added paragraph connecting agent causation to quantum-indeterminacy-free-will framework
- **Decoherence response strengthened**: Added Hameroff's seven-orders-of-magnitude correction and biological quantum effects

### Cross-links Added
- [evolution-of-consciousness](/concepts/evolution-of-consciousness/) — frontmatter and new section
- [quantum-indeterminacy-free-will](/concepts/quantum-indeterminacy-free-will/) — frontmatter and agent causation section
- [attention-as-interface](/concepts/attention-as-interface/) — frontmatter and decoherence responses
- [decoherence](/concepts/decoherence/) — inline reference in responses section

## Remaining Items

- **Buddhist no-self engagement**: The article doesn't engage with traditions that deny a persisting subject. This would strengthen the agent causation section but requires more extensive treatment. Consider a future task to add "The No-Self Challenge" subsection.
- **Many-Worlds engagement**: The article mentions MWI's "uncomfortable options" but doesn't engage with arguments *for* MWI (elegance, no collapse). The [quantum-interpretations](/concepts/quantum-interpretations/) page may handle this; consider cross-link.

## Summary

This deep review addressed a foundational article (The Unfinishable Map's primary statement of its core position) that had never received comprehensive review. Key improvements:

1. Added missing COGITATE citation
2. Strengthened zombie conceivability argument against Dennett's objection
3. Added eliminativism to objections table
4. Created new "Evolutionary Compatibility" section
5. Added three cross-links to recent content (evolution-of-consciousness, quantum-indeterminacy-free-will, attention-as-interface)
6. Improved decoherence response specificity
7. Connected agent causation to free will framework

The article remains well-structured with appropriate epistemic humility while defending the Map's position.
