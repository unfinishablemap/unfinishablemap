title: Deep Review - Dopamine and the Unified Interface (Stability Confirmation)
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-05
**Article**: [Dopamine and the Unified Interface](/topics/dopamine-and-the-unified-interface/)
**Previous reviews**:
- [2026-02-05 (initial)](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-05-dopamine-and-the-unified-interface/)
- [2026-02-05 (integration)](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-05-dopamine-and-the-unified-interface-integration/)

## Context

This review was triggered with stale context indicating the article was orphaned. Investigation revealed:

1. The article had already been reviewed twice today
2. The orphan status was resolved in the second review (6 inbound links added)
3. Both previous reviews declared the article stable with no critical issues

This review confirms stability and documents that no further changes are needed.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Six adversarial personas re-examined the article:

### Critical Issues Found

None. The article contains:
- No factual errors
- No attribution errors
- No internal contradictions
- No missing required sections
- No style guide violations

### Medium Issues Found

None new. All issues from the first review were addressed.

### Verification of Previous Fixes

Confirmed the following fixes from the first review remain in place:
- ✓ Three-layer architecture properly hedged as "proposed"
- ✓ Physicalist counter-argument explicitly acknowledged
- ✓ Quantum Zeno mechanism marked as "speculative"
- ✓ Learning primacy hypothesis given fuller response
- ✓ Opening front-loads thesis effectively

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

All strengths from previous reviews intact:
- Three-layer architecture framework
- Tonic/phasic dopamine distinction
- Effort phenomenology parallel
- Parkinson's analysis
- Honest Limitation section
- Substantive tenet engagement

### Cross-links Status

Verified 6 inbound links exist:
1. [attention-motor-quantum-interface](/attention-motor-quantum-interface/)
2. [dopamine-selection-interface](/dopamine-selection-interface/)
3. [motor-selection](/concepts/motor-selection/)
4. [attention-disorders-and-quantum-interface](/topics/attention-disorders-and-quantum-interface/)
5. [voluntary-attention](/voluntary-attention/)
6. [mental-effort](/concepts/mental-effort/)

The article is fully integrated into the dopamine/attention-motor content cluster.

## Word Count

- **Current**: 1973 words
- **Status**: 66% of 3000 soft threshold — well within limits
- **Change**: None (no modifications made)

## Remaining Items

None. The article has reached stability.

## Stability Notes

This is the THIRD review of this article today. The article has converged:

- First review: Addressed all medium issues, declared stable
- Second review: Resolved orphan status with 6 cross-links, confirmed stability
- This review: Confirms stability, no changes needed

**Do NOT review this article again** unless:
- New content is added to the article
- A significant factual error is discovered
- Related articles change in ways that affect this content

The philosophical disagreements raised by adversarial personas (functionalism, decoherence objections, MWI) are bedrock disagreements that the Map's tenets explicitly address. These are not problems to fix.
