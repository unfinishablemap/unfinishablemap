title: Deep Review - Selection Laws
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Article**: [Selection Laws](/concepts/selection-laws/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article is internally consistent, well-structured, and contains no factual errors or broken references.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Functionalist response underaddressed**: The article dismissed epiphenomenalism via self-stultification but didn't engage with functionalist accounts that explain reports about consciousness without positing downward causation. **Resolution**: Added a paragraph explaining the functionalist response and why the Map's hard problem argument counters it.

- **Empirical falsifiability unclear**: The article lacked clarity on what experiments would distinguish genuine selection from apparent selection. **Resolution**: Added a paragraph in "What Would Challenge This View?" specifying empirical predictions (willed vs. instructed attention signatures, meditation training effects, bandwidth constraints).

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Functionalist account of mental reports**: That mental reports can be accurate because they track functional states, not because phenomenal properties cause them. **How addressed**: Added engagement explaining this returns us to the hard problem—if phenomenal properties are distinct from functional properties (as the Map holds), accurate reports about them require causal connection.

### Low Issues Noted
- Schaffer "t-shirt problem" terminology unexplained (deferred—readers can follow the reference)
- Decoherence challenge relatively brief for an article about quantum selection (acceptable—detailed treatment exists in psychophysical-coupling article)

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear supervenience/selection law distinction (the article's central contribution)
- Four-question framework for specifying selection laws (mental variables, physical variables, bandwidth, scope)
- Phenomenologically grounded mental variables (attention, intention, effort, valence)
- Honest acknowledgment of the specification problem and "t-shirt problem"
- Strong tenet integration in "Relation to Site Perspective"
- Effective comparative table (lines 91-98)

### Enhancements Made
- Added engagement with functionalist response to self-stultification argument
- Added empirical testability section with specific predictions
- Added connection to free will and agent causation (new cross-links)

### Cross-links Added
- [free-will](/topics/free-will/)
- [agent-causation](/concepts/agent-causation/)

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues were addressed.

## Stability Notes

The article's position on selection laws is philosophically contentious—eliminative materialists, hard-nosed physicalists, and MWI defenders will continue to disagree. This represents bedrock philosophical disagreement, not fixable flaws. Future reviews should not re-flag "functionalists disagree" or "MWI provides an alternative" as critical issues—these are acknowledged as the tenets-based positions the Map takes.

The decoherence challenge is engaged briefly here but treated in depth in [psychophysical-coupling](/concepts/psychophysical-laws/). If reviewers find this treatment thin, the appropriate response is cross-linking, not duplication.
