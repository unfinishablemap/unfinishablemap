**Article**: [Episodic Memory](/concepts/episodic-memory/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Missing illusionist engagement**: The article made strong claims about irreducible phenomenology without addressing the most sophisticated physicalist challenge.
   - **Resolution**: Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section with three-part response (regress problem, phenomenology of introspection, functional asymmetry).

2. **Incomplete tenet coverage**: Only 4 of 5 tenets addressed in "Relation to Site Perspective."
   - **Resolution**: Expanded section to include Minimal Quantum Interaction and Occam's Razor Has Limits with substantive connections.

3. **No falsifiability conditions**: Claims about memorial phenomenology were presented without criteria for what would challenge them.
   - **Resolution**: Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section with 5 specific falsifiability conditions.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **No Process Philosophy perspective**: Article missed opportunity to connect constructive memory to Whitehead's metaphysics.
   - **Resolution**: Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section connecting memory to actual occasions, prehension, and concrescence.

2. **Missing contemplative evidence**: No engagement with meditation traditions' insights on memory phenomenology.
   - **Resolution**: Added "Contemplative Evidence" section covering witness consciousness, jhana states, and cessation contrast.

3. **Thin quantum connection**: Binding discussion didn't engage with decoherence challenges.
   - **Resolution**: Added decoherence acknowledgment in Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet connection.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Illusionist challenge**: Re-experiencing is mere misrepresentation
  - Addressed with regress argument, introspection intensification, functional asymmetry

- **Eliminative materialist**: Pastness quale is folk-psychological description
  - Addressed through phenomenology of introspection argument

- **Buddhist challenge**: Extended self contradicts anatta
  - Addressed indirectly through witness consciousness framing

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Excellent encoding/retrieval/consolidation analysis with clear dissociation table
- Strong phenomenological descriptions of pastness quale and double presence
- Effective remember/know distinction presentation
- Good personal identity connection with Locke discussion
- Solid hippocampal binding discussion

### Enhancements Made

2. Added "Contemplative Evidence" section (3 subsections)
3. Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section (3 subsections)
4. Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section (5 conditions)
5. Expanded "Relation to Site Perspective" from 4 to 5 tenets
6. Added 7 new concept cross-links to frontmatter
7. Added 6 new Further Reading entries
8. Added 5 new References
