**Date**: 2026-01-29
**Article**: [Neuroplasticity](/concepts/neuroplasticity/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article is well-structured, cites its sources appropriately, has the required "Relation to Site Perspective" section, and makes appropriately hedged claims throughout.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Stapp's mechanism presented too credulously**: The quantum Zeno mechanism was presented as a "specific proposal" without sufficient acknowledgment of its highly speculative status and the scepticism most physicists have about quantum coherence in biological systems.
   - **Resolution**: Added explicit language noting it is "highly speculative" and that "most physicists remain sceptical that quantum coherence survives long enough in warm biological tissue."

2. **Reference typo**: The Davidson & Lutz (2008) reference had reversed page numbers (176-174 instead of 176-184).
   - **Resolution**: Corrected to 176-184.

3. **Missing falsifiability acknowledgment**: The article didn't specify what evidence would count against the interactionist interpretation.
   - **Resolution**: Added paragraph noting that if purely mechanical interventions could replicate all effects of cognitive therapy, the interactionist interpretation would be weakened.

### Counterarguments Considered

1. **Eliminative materialist objection**: Folk psychological terms like "mental effort" and "consciousness" are placeholders for neural processes, not primitive explanatory categories.
   - **How addressed**: The article already acknowledges this in the "Epiphenomenalist Response" section, noting the alternative account that "the pathway is *neural intention* → *neural attention* → *neural reorganisation*." The article engages with this rather than ignoring it.

2. **Physicalist objection (Dennett-style)**: The therapy consists of physical interventions; the "feeling of effort" is just a functional state.
   - **How addressed**: The article acknowledges this is a possible interpretation but argues it fails to explain why effort phenomenology tracks genuine cognitive difficulty. This remains a philosophical standoff, not a fixable flaw.

3. **Quantum skeptic objection**: Decoherence times are too short for quantum effects in neural tissue.
   - **How addressed**: Now made more explicit with added language about physicist scepticism. The article appropriately notes this is speculative while preserving the general point that attention bridges consciousness and neural change.

4. **MWI objection**: The quantum Zeno mechanism requires collapse, which MWI rejects.
   - **Bedrock disagreement**: The Map explicitly rejects MWI in its tenets. This is a foundational philosophical difference, not a flaw.

5. **Buddhist nondualist objection**: The framework presupposes a clear distinction between consciousness and brain.
   - **Bedrock disagreement**: The Map is committed to interactionist dualism. Different metaphysical frameworks will disagree at this level.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- **Balanced epistemics**: The "What Neuroplasticity Shows (and Doesn't)" section maintains appropriate humility about what the evidence can and cannot demonstrate.
- **Phenomenological argument**: The critique of epiphenomenalism via the "why does effort phenomenology track difficulty" argument is sound and well-articulated.
- **Comprehensive tenet connection**: The article connects to four of the five tenets (Dualism, Bidirectional Interaction, Minimal Quantum Interaction, Occam's Limits), each with substantive explanation.
- **Clear structure**: Front-loaded summary, modular sections, proper references.
- **Appropriate hedging**: Claims are calibrated to evidence ("harder to square with" rather than "proves").

### Enhancements Made

1. Added explicit scepticism about quantum mechanisms in the "Attention as the Mechanism" section.
2. Fixed reference page number typo.
3. Added falsifiability paragraph to "What Neuroplasticity Shows" section.

## Remaining Items

None. All medium issues have been addressed. The philosophical disagreements identified (MWI, Buddhist nondualism, eliminative materialism) represent bedrock differences with the Map's tenets, not fixable flaws.

## Stability Notes

The following represent fundamental philosophical disagreements, not issues requiring correction in future reviews:

- **MWI proponents will find the collapse assumption unsatisfying**—the Map explicitly rejects MWI in its tenets. This is an intentional philosophical commitment.
- **Eliminative materialists will reject the explanatory role of folk psychology**—but the article engages with this objection rather than ignoring it. The phenomenological argument stands as a response.
- **Quantum sceptics may find even the hedged treatment of Stapp too generous**—but the Map's Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet requires engaging with possible mechanisms. The added scepticism language should suffice; further hedging would undermine the article's purpose.

## Word Count

Before: 1648 words
After: ~1710 words (+62 words, 68% of 2500 soft threshold)

The modest additions remain well within length guidelines.
