title: Deep Review - Time-Symmetric Physics
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-04
**Article**: [Time-Symmetric Physics](/concepts/time-symmetric-physics/)
**Previous review**: [2026-02-03](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-03-time-symmetric-physics/)
**Context**: Orphan integration focus—article had no inbound links

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article remains stable after two prior reviews (2026-02-02, 2026-02-03).

### Medium Issues Found
None. Previous reviews resolved all medium-priority concerns:
- Decoherence response expanded
- Mathematical vs. causal symmetry distinction added to Price's Argument
- Cross-link to presentiment-and-retrocausality added

### Attribution Check
All source attributions verified correct:
- Cramer (1986) transactional interpretation
- Aharonov, Bergmann, Lebowitz (1964) TSVF
- Wheeler-Feynman (1945) absorber theory
- Price (1996, 2012) time-symmetry arguments
- Kastner (2012) possibilist extension

### Orphan Status Analysis
The article was well-written but **completely orphaned**—no content articles linked to it. This is problematic because:
1. Users cannot discover this article by navigating from related content
2. The time-symmetric physics foundation supports many Map arguments but was invisible in the navigation graph
3. LLMs crawling the site would miss the connection between retrocausality claims and their physics grounding

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Comprehensive T-symmetry coverage (classical, EM, QM, gravity)
- Clear explanations of TI and TSVF frameworks
- Strong Libet resolution section
- Well-connected to all five tenets
- Appropriate epistemic humility ("indistinguishability cuts both ways")
- 1914 words (77% of 2500 threshold)—no length concerns

### Cross-Links Added (Primary Focus of This Review)
Added inbound links from six articles that discuss time-symmetric concepts:

1. **[retrocausality](/concepts/retrocausality/)** — Added link in "Retrocausality in Physics" section where time-symmetric equations are discussed
2. **[collapse-and-time](/concepts/collapse-and-time/)** — Added link in "Time-Symmetric Interpretations: Atemporal Collapse" section header
3. **[philosophy-of-time](/concepts/philosophy-of-time/)** — Added link in Quantum Mechanics subsection on time-symmetric interpretations
4. **[quantum-interpretations](/concepts/quantum-interpretations/)** — Added introductory sentence to TI/TSVF section referencing the physics foundation
5. **[libet-experiments](/concepts/libet-experiments/)** — Made "Time-symmetric physics" a wikilink in the Retrocausal Resolution section
6. **[free-will](/topics/free-will/)** — Added link in temporal problem section grounding retrocausality in fundamental physics

### Files Modified

## Remaining Items

None. The article has reached stability after three reviews. The orphan status has been resolved through cross-linking.

## Stability Notes

This article is stable. Previous reviews identified fundamental philosophical disagreements that are not flaws:
- Eliminative materialists will always object to consciousness in physics
- Many-worlds defenders prefer MWI's avoidance of collapse
- Strict empiricists object to interpretation being unfalsifiable

These are bedrock disagreements, not issues requiring further revision.

The article now has inbound links from all major articles that discuss time-symmetric physics concepts. Future reviews should NOT:
- Re-flag the philosophical disagreements as critical
- Add more content (article is appropriately sized at 77% of threshold)
- Seek additional cross-links (major navigation paths now established)
