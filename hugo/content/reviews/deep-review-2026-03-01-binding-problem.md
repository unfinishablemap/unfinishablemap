**Date**: 2026-03-01
**Article**: [The Binding Problem](/concepts/binding-problem/)
**Previous review**: [2026-02-24](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-24-binding-problem/)
**Context**: Cross-review considering entanglement-binding-hypothesis.md insights (created 2026-03-01)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Broken wikilinks to non-existent articles**: `[quantum-binding-and-phenomenal-unity](/topics/quantum-holism-and-phenomenal-unity/)` (2 occurrences) and `[quantum-coherence-and-binding-evidence](/concepts/quantum-neural-mechanisms-and-coherence/)` (1 occurrence) referenced articles that don't exist. With the new `entanglement-binding-hypothesis.md` covering the structural argument, experimental evidence, and limitations, all three links redirected to `[entanglement-binding-hypothesis](/concepts/entanglement-binding-hypothesis/)`. The duplicate Further Reading entry was consolidated into one.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Unattributed quote** (line 66): "As researchers note, 'A unified conscious moment...'" used vague attribution violating the style guide. Rephrased as the article's own argument, removing the unattributed quote while preserving the substantive point.
2. **Missing cross-link to entanglement-binding-hypothesis**: The new article is the most detailed treatment of quantum binding on the site. Added to frontmatter concepts list and integrated into the quantum section body text.
3. **`[why-phenomenal-unity-resists-explanation](/topics/quantum-holism-and-phenomenal-unity/)` still doesn't exist** (line 90): Deferred from previous review. This planned article is referenced consistently across multiple articles and should be created or redirected systematically. Not changed in this review.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Eliminativist (Churchland)**: BP1/BP2 distinction presupposes phenomenal unity. Bedrock disagreement — article engages via illusionism subsection. Not re-flagged.
- **Physicalist (Dennett)**: Illusionist response adequate with infinite regress and argument from reason. Not re-flagged.
- **Quantum skeptic (Tegmark)**: Quantum section remains properly hedged. Not re-flagged.
- **MWI defender (Deutsch)**: Indexical argument in tenet section adequate. Not re-flagged.
- **Empiricist (Popper)**: Testable commitments section adequate. Unattributed quote fixed.
- **Buddhist (Nagarjuna)**: Deferred in previous reviews for potential dedicated article. Not re-flagged.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- **BP1/BP2 distinction** (lines 60-70): Clear, pedagogically excellent. Foundational.
- **Sleep dissociation argument** (lines 114-119): Original Map contribution. Unique insight.
- **Cross-domain binding** (lines 108-123): Temporal, memory, and language binding extending the problem.
- **Quantum section hedging**: Core argument explicitly survives if quantum hypothesis fails.
- **Testable commitments** (lines 153-170): Both supporting and undermining predictions. Intellectually honest.
- **Mysterian caveat** (lines 147-153): Well-placed epistemic humility.
- **Illusionist engagement** (lines 72-77): Two clear objections (infinite regress, argument from reason).

### Enhancements Made

1. **Entanglement-binding-hypothesis integration**: Quantum section now links to the new dedicated article, pointing readers to the structural argument (non-separability of entangled states), experimental evidence, and acknowledged limitations.
2. **Broken links resolved**: Three references to non-existent articles replaced with links to `entanglement-binding-hypothesis`, which covers the same territory.
3. **Unattributed quote fixed**: Vague "as researchers note" replaced with the article's own formulation of the same point.
4. **Frontmatter updated**: Added `[entanglement-binding-hypothesis](/concepts/entanglement-binding-hypothesis/)` to concepts list, establishing the bidirectional cross-reference.

### Cross-Links Added/Strengthened

- [entanglement-binding-hypothesis](/concepts/entanglement-binding-hypothesis/) — now linked in frontmatter concepts, quantum section body text, and Further Reading

## Remaining Items

- **[why-phenomenal-unity-resists-explanation](/topics/quantum-holism-and-phenomenal-unity/)** doesn't exist but is referenced at line 90. Deferred from 2026-02-24 review. Should be created or references redirected systematically across all referencing articles.

## Stability Notes

This article has reached stability. Three previous deep reviews (2026-01-22, 2026-02-24) plus a 2026-02-09 refinement addressed all major structural, argumentative, and attribution issues. This review's changes are targeted cross-review improvements prompted by the new entanglement-binding-hypothesis article — resolving broken links and establishing cross-references, not restructuring.

**Bedrock disagreements (do not re-flag):**
- Illusionists will always reject the BP1/BP2 distinction as question-begging. The article engages the objection; further expansion is not warranted.
- Buddhist no-self challenge was explicitly deferred in the 2026-01-22 review for a potential dedicated article.
- MWI defenders will find the indexical argument unsatisfying. Fundamental philosophical disagreement.
- Quantum skeptics will remain unconvinced by preliminary evidence. The article already hedges appropriately.
