title: Deep Review - Psychophysical Coupling
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-01-30
**Article**: [Psychophysical Coupling](/psychophysical-coupling/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-29](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-29-psychophysical-coupling/)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Six adversarial personas applied. Given the previous review was just yesterday and marked several items as resolved or bedrock disagreements, this review focused on identifying any NEW issues.

### Eliminative Materialist (Churchland)
- Folk-psychological categories presupposed — **Previous review: bedrock disagreement, not re-flagged**

### Hard-Nosed Physicalist (Dennett)
- Illusionism section noted as "thin" — **Previous review: deferred as adequate for scope**
- Heterophenomenology not fully engaged — **Previous decision stands**

### Quantum Skeptic (Tegmark)
- Decoherence responses cite disputed Hameroff calculations — **Previous review: acknowledged as ongoing dispute**
- No new issues

### Many-Worlds Defender (Deutsch)
- Law Family 4 MWI distinction — **Resolved in previous review**
- Ontological distinction now clear and adequate

### Empiricist (Popper)
- Testable predictions somewhat vague — **Previous review: "inherent limitation of early-stage theory"**
- No new issues

### Buddhist Philosopher (Nagarjuna)
- Assumes self-subsisting conscious subject — **Previous review: "beyond scope"**

### Critical Issues Found
None.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Citation incomplete**: Reference 7 cited "Meister 2024, Caltech" but the research was published in *Neuron* as Zheng & Meister 2024. **Resolved**: corrected citation and in-text reference.

### Counterarguments Considered
All major counterarguments were addressed in previous review. No new philosophical objections identified.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

Six sympathetic personas applied.

### Property Dualist (Chalmers)
- Chalmers' three psychophysical principles well-treated
- Upward/downward direction distinction remains a useful contribution

### Quantum Mind Theorist (Stapp)
- Attention-as-observation mechanism section is strong
- James phenomenology connection insightful

### Phenomenologist (Nagel)
- Contemplative Evidence section provides valuable experiential grounding
- First-person data treated as legitimate evidence

### Process Philosopher (Whitehead)
- Bandwidth constraint captures processual nature of selection
- Policy-level selection appropriately dynamic

### Libertarian Free Will Defender (Kane)
- Libet treatment nuanced
- Policy-level selection coherent for libertarian free will

### Mysterian (McGinn)
- Appropriate epistemic humility maintained
- Coupling law framed as research program, not solved problem

### Strengths Preserved
- Chalmers framework treatment (comprehensive and accurate)
- Bandwidth constraint analysis (empirically grounded)
- Comparative analysis table (excellent at-a-glance summary)
- Five candidate mechanisms section (systematic, appropriately qualified)
- Contemplative evidence section (unique contribution)
- Relation to Site Perspective (thorough tenet alignment)

### Enhancements Made
- Corrected Zheng & Meister citation to proper journal format
- Updated in-text reference to match corrected citation

### Cross-links Added
None needed — article already extensively cross-linked.

## Remaining Items

None. Article has reached stability.

## Stability Notes

This article was reviewed yesterday (2026-01-29). The current review confirms stability:

1. **No new critical issues** — The previous review found none; this review confirms
2. **Bedrock disagreements remain bedrock** — Eliminativist, MWI, and decoherence objections are philosophical standoffs, not fixable problems
3. **Previous improvements hold** — MWI distinction, post-decoherence clarification still adequate
4. **Minimal changes made** — Only the citation fix was warranted

**Convergence assessment**: This article has stabilized. Future reviews should confirm stability rather than seeking new changes. The article comprehensively covers psychophysical coupling, engages major objections honestly, and aligns well with site tenets.
