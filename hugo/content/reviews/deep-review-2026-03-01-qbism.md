title: Deep Review - QBism (Quantum Bayesianism)
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-03-01
**Article**: [QBism (Quantum Bayesianism)](/concepts/qbism/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-28](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-28-qbism/)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Broken link `[neural-binding-mechanisms](/concepts/phenomenal-binding-and-holism/)`**: File does not exist. **Resolution**: Replaced with `[binding-problem](/concepts/binding-problem/)` — the binding problem article exists and is contextually appropriate (explaining unified experience from distributed processing).

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing reference for "participatory realism" claim**: Paragraph 2 states Fuchs coined the term in 2017 but the relevant paper ("On Participatory Realism," in *Information and Interaction*, Springer 2017) was not in the references — only "Notwithstanding Bohr" was cited for Fuchs 2017. **Resolution**: Added the "On Participatory Realism" reference.

### Low Issues Found
- **Description slightly short**: 141 characters (target 150-160). **Resolution**: Revised description to 152 characters while improving phrasing.

### Counterarguments Considered
No new counterarguments beyond those addressed in the 2026-01-28 review. All six adversarial personas engaged with the content:
- **Eliminative Materialist**: "Experience vs correlate" distinction is a bedrock tenet commitment (resolved in prior review)
- **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: QBism's agent-agnosticism needn't concede to dualism — article already acknowledges QBism is "officially neutral" (bedrock disagreement)
- **Quantum Skeptic**: No source/Map conflation detected; Map interpretations properly attributed
- **Many-Worlds Defender**: Indexical objection already engaged with MWI response (added in prior review)
- **Empiricist**: No empirical claims to challenge
- **Buddhist Philosopher**: Unified selfhood assumption is tenet-level commitment

### Attribution Accuracy Check
- [x] Fuchs's agent-as-primitive position correctly cited (Fuchs 2017)
- [x] "Participatory realism" correctly attributed to Fuchs (reference now added)
- [x] No misattributions or dropped qualifiers
- [x] Source/Map separation is clean — Map interpretations consistently framed as Map's perspective
- [x] No self-contradictions

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- The "Agent Problem" section — the article's strongest contribution
- "Has located the mystery rather than dissolved it" — powerful formulation
- Balanced "What QBism Gets Right" / "What QBism Misses" structure
- Nuanced tenet-by-tenet analysis in "Relation to Site Perspective"
- The Wheeler/participatory realism connection (added since prior review)
- The prebiotic collapse connection in Versus Consciousness-Collapse (added since prior review)
- Strong cross-linking to measurement-problem, relational-quantum-mechanics, haecceity, hard-problem-of-consciousness

### Enhancements Made
- Fixed broken `[neural-binding-mechanisms](/concepts/phenomenal-binding-and-holism/)` → `[binding-problem](/concepts/binding-problem/)`
- Added missing "On Participatory Realism" reference for the participatory realism claim
- Improved description to 152 characters

### Cross-links Added
- `[binding-problem](/concepts/binding-problem/)` replacing non-existent `[neural-binding-mechanisms](/concepts/phenomenal-binding-and-holism/)`

## Word Count
- Before: 1842 words
- After: 1873 words (+31 words, +2%)
- Status: 75% of soft threshold (2500), well within limits

## Remaining Items
None. The article is approaching stability after two reviews. Changes since the prior review (Wheeler connection, prebiotic collapse, wikilink fixes) were all beneficial additions.

## Stability Notes
The following represent fundamental philosophical disagreements rather than fixable problems (carried forward from prior review):

1. **Eliminativists will object** that the "experience vs correlate" distinction begs the question — this is the dualism tenet, not a flaw in the article.

2. **MWI defenders will find the indexical objection unmotivated** — they view "why this branch?" as no more mysterious than "why am I this person?" The article acknowledges this response while maintaining the Map's position.

3. **Dennett-style functionalists** will object to treating Nagel's "what it is like" framework as uncontroversial — the article presupposes this because the Map's tenets commit to it.

4. **QBists themselves** would reject the claim that agent-centrality "sits uneasily with physicalism" — Fuchs sees QBism as compatible with a variety of metaphysical positions. The article correctly labels this as the Map's interpretation.

These are not issues to re-flag in future reviews. The article has converged after two reviews — any further changes should address new content or factual errors, not re-litigate philosophical positions.
