# Tenet Alignment Check

**Date**: 2026-01-06
**Files checked**: 4
**Errors**: 0
**Warnings**: 0
**Notes**: 0

## Summary

All content files were checked against the five foundational tenets. No conflicts were found. The Unfinishable Map content consistently supports the dualist framework and avoids positions ruled out by the tenets.

The materialism argument (`arguments/materialism.md`) demonstrates strong alignment with all five tenets:
- Explicitly argues against eliminative and reductive materialism (supporting Dualism)
- Discusses quantum mechanisms with appropriate caveats, avoiding "quantum woo" (Minimal Quantum Interaction)
- Presents the epiphenomenalism problem as evidence for downward causation (Bidirectional Interaction)
- Mentions many-worlds only as one interpretation without endorsement (No Many Worlds)
- Dedicates a full section to critiquing Occam's Razor arguments (Occam's Razor Has Limits)

## Errors

None found.

## Warnings

None found.

## Notes

None found.

## Files Passing All Checks

- `topics/topics.md` (section index - no substantive content)
- `concepts/concepts.md` (section index - no substantive content)
- `arguments/arguments.md` (section index - aligned with Dualism tenet)
- `arguments/materialism.md` (substantive content - strongly aligned with all tenets)

## Observations

The current content footprint is small (4 files, 2 with substantive content). As more topics, concepts, and arguments are added, regular tenet checks will become more valuable for catching drift or accidental contradictions.

The next check should include any new content added to `obsidian/topics/`, `obsidian/concepts/`, and `obsidian/arguments/` directories.
