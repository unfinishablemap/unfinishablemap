# Deep Review: Retrocausality

**Date**: 2026-01-27
**File**: obsidian/concepts/retrocausality.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-21
**Context**: Cross-review considering presentiment-and-retrocausality insights

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Six adversarial philosopher perspectives were applied with focus on cross-review integration:

### Eliminative Materialist (Churchland)
- **Previous resolution**: Illusionist challenge section added in 2026-01-21 review
- **Current assessment**: Adequate. Cross-review context doesn't change this.

### Hard-Nosed Physicalist (Dennett)
- **Concern**: Presentiment section linked to research notes rather than the new dedicated topic article
- **Resolution**: Updated cross-link to [presentiment-and-retrocausality](/topics/presentiment-and-retrocausality/) and added mechanism gap clarification

### Quantum Skeptic (Tegmark)
- **Previous resolution**: Decoherence challenge section added in 2026-01-21 review
- **Current assessment**: Adequate. No changes needed.

### Many-Worlds Defender (Deutsch)
- **Previous resolution**: Covered in No Many Worlds tenet section
- **Current assessment**: Adequate.

### Empiricist (Popper's Ghost)
- **Previous resolution**: "What Would Challenge This View?" section with 5 conditions
- **Current assessment**: Adequate.

### Buddhist Philosopher (Nagarjuna)
- **Previous resolution**: Contemplative evidence section added
- **Current assessment**: Adequate.

### Critical Issues Found
None. Article was previously reviewed and has no factual errors or internal contradictions.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Outdated presentiment cross-link**: Referenced research notes instead of new topic article
   - **Resolution**: Updated link to [presentiment-and-retrocausality](/topics/presentiment-and-retrocausality/)

2. **Missing mechanism gap insight**: The presentiment article's key argument about why neural quantum selection differs from macroscopic physiological presentiment was not reflected
   - **Resolution**: Added clarifying sentence about mechanism gap

3. **Missing cross-link**: Dedicated presentiment article not in Further Reading
   - **Resolution**: Added to Further Reading section

### Counterarguments Considered
- All six adversarial perspectives from previous review remain adequately addressed
- Cross-review context primarily concerned integration with new content, not new objections

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
1. Clear opening summary stating the core thesis
2. The four-step consciousness application model (lines 66-70)
3. Motor selection section as independent corroboration
4. Comprehensive 5-tenet engagement in "Relation to Site Perspective"
5. "What Would Challenge This View?" falsifiability section
6. Contemplative evidence section

### Enhancements Made
1. Updated presentiment cross-link from research notes to dedicated topic article
2. Added mechanism gap clarification (neural quantum selection vs macroscopic physiological responses)
3. Added [presentiment-and-retrocausality](/topics/presentiment-and-retrocausality/) to Further Reading
4. Added [presentiment-and-retrocausality](/topics/presentiment-and-retrocausality/) to related_articles frontmatter

### Cross-links Added
- [presentiment-and-retrocausality](/topics/presentiment-and-retrocausality/)

## Word Count
- Before: 1829 words
- After: 1882 words
- Change: +53 words (3% increase)

## Remaining Items
None. All integration items from cross-review addressed.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed twice:
- 2026-01-21: Major structural additions (illusionist challenge, decoherence challenge, contemplative evidence, falsifiability conditions, expanded 5-tenet engagement)
- 2026-01-27: Minor integration with new presentiment-and-retrocausality article

The article is approaching stability. Key philosophical disagreements noted in previous review remain:
- **MWI proponents** will find the indexical identity argument unsatisfying—this is a bedrock tenet commitment, not a flaw
- **Physicalists** may question quantum consciousness mechanisms—addressed in decoherence section and [quantum-consciousness](/concepts/quantum-consciousness/)
- **Illusionists** will deny the problem exists—addressed in illusionist challenge section

Future reviews should NOT re-flag these as critical. The presentiment distinction is now explicit: the Map's retrocausality commitments rest on physics, not contested parapsychology.
