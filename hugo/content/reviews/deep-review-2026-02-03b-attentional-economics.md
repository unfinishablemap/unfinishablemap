title: Deep Review - Attentional Economics (Cross-Review)
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Article**: [Attentional Economics](/concepts/attentional-economics/)
**Previous review**: [2026-02-03](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-03-attentional-economics/) (earlier today)
**Context**: Cross-review triggered by habituation void research insights

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article remains well-constructed with appropriate hedging on speculative mechanisms and accurate tenet connections. Previous reviews (2026-01-31, 2026-02-03) addressed all identified issues. This third review confirms stability.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Falsifiability concern** (Empiricist persona): The framework risks unfalsifiability since any outcome could be interpreted as consistent with it. However, this is inherent to philosophical frameworks, and the article appropriately points to the argument from reason as providing additional support.

### Counterarguments Considered
All six adversarial personas engaged:
1. **Eliminative Materialist**: "Conscious bandwidth" could be global workspace broadcasting—philosophical disagreement, appropriately hedged with "within the Map's framework"
2. **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: Phenomenology as evidence is heterophenomenologically suspect—bedrock disagreement from previous review
3. **Quantum Skeptic**: Zeno mechanism speculative—already hedged with "if it's the mechanism"
4. **MWI Defender**: Indexical scarcity under MWI—bedrock disagreement from previous review
5. **Empiricist**: Falsifiability concern—genuine but reflects nature of frameworks
6. **Buddhist Philosopher**: Reification of attention/agent—bedrock disagreement reflecting Map's dualist commitments

All represent expected philosophical standoffs rather than fixable problems.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Novel reframing of agency (sustained attention allocation over time)
- Economic table mapping (scarcity, allocation, investment, return, opportunity cost)
- Four-element phenomenological analysis (felt alternatives, selection effort, opportunity awareness, investment temporality)
- Three-level structure (selection, witness mode, meta-level agency)
- Appropriate hedging on quantum mechanisms
- Moral responsibility nuances (scaling, cultivation, structural factors)

### Enhancements Made

**New section added: "Habituation and the Boundaries of the Attentional Economy"**

This cross-review with the habituation void research revealed a natural extension: habituation creates a *structural boundary* on the attentional economy by removing contents from phenomenal awareness. The enhancement:

1. **Explains habituation as attentional contraction** — The familiar drops out of the phenomenal field, shrinking the set of options available for allocation
2. **Three-tier attentional status table** — Novel/salient (full economy), familiar but attendable (reduced liquidity), fully habituated (outside economy)
3. **De-habituation as agency expansion** — Meditation and "beginner's mind" work partly by restoring habituated content to conscious access
4. **Why sustained practice is necessary** — Habituation is structural and reasserts automatically; maintaining expanded economy requires continuous counteraction

This connects attentional economics to the forthcoming habituation void article and strengthens the account of why contemplative practices require ongoing effort.

### Cross-links Added
None needed—article already well-linked. Future link to habituation void article once written.

## Word Count

- Before: 2120 words (85% of threshold)
- After: 2409 words (96% of threshold)
- Change: +289 words

## Remaining Items

None. The article is stable and enhanced.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed three times (2026-01-31, 2026-02-03 twice). The pessimistic review found no new issues; all concerns are bedrock philosophical disagreements that previous reviews correctly identified as not requiring fixes.

**Bedrock disagreements** (do not re-flag as critical in future reviews):
- Functionalist alternative explanations for effort phenomenology
- MWI defender's indexical response
- Buddhist critique of reified attention/agent
- Empiricist falsifiability concerns (inherent to philosophical frameworks)

The article is now mature. Future reviews should:
1. Check for new cross-linking opportunities as new Map content is added
2. Verify the habituation section links to the habituation void article once it's written
3. Not seek changes to the core argument unless new factual information emerges
