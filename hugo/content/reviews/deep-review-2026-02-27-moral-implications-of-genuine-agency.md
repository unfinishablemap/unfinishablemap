title: Deep Review - Moral Implications of Genuine Agency
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-27
**Article**: [Moral Implications of Genuine Agency](/topics/moral-implications-of-genuine-agency/)
**Previous review**: [2026-02-23](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-23-moral-implications-of-genuine-agency/)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None. The previous review addressed all critical issues effectively.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Wolf attribution imprecision**: "Wolf's reason-responsiveness" used Fischer/Ravizza's term rather than Wolf's distinctive "Reason View." The apex article `consciousness-and-agency.md` correctly uses "Wolf's Reason View." Resolution: fixed to "Wolf's Reason View."
- **Orphan status**: Zero inbound links from any content article despite being a key synthesis piece in the ethics cluster. Resolution: added cross-references from 10 related articles (see below).

### Low Issues Found
- **One remaining "not X but Y" pattern**: Line 45 "not a psychological artefact but an appropriate response." Resolution: rephrased to "responds appropriately to having authored harm."

### Counterarguments Considered
- All six adversarial personas engaged. No new counterarguments beyond those addressed in the 2026-02-23 review. The article's positions represent bedrock philosophical disagreements with eliminative materialism, hard determinism, and MWI—these are expected, not fixable.

## Attribution Accuracy Check

- **d'Holbach as hard determinist**: Correct (System of Nature, 1770)
- **"condemned to be free" from Sartre**: Correct (Being and Nothingness)
- **"ought implies can" attributed to Kant**: Appropriately hedged as "commonly attributed to Kant"
- **Frankfurt's hierarchical desires**: Correct (1971)
- **Fischer and Ravizza's guidance control**: Correct (1998)
- **Wolf's Reason View**: Now correct (was imprecise as "reason-responsiveness")
- **Nagel's moral luck taxonomy**: Correct (1979)
- **Aristotle's hexis**: Correct (Nicomachean Ethics Book II)
- **Mackie's queerness argument**: Correct (1977)
- **Pereboom as hard determinist**: Correct (2001)

No attribution errors found.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening framing connecting genuine agency to "responses to facts about what conscious beings actually do"
- "Peculiar consolation" of determinism and its removal
- Nagel moral luck taxonomy with precise elimination of fourth category
- "The 'ought' has a real addressee" formulation
- Aristotle/hexis integration with Map's metaphysical backing
- Three-part moral theory demands structure (error theory, consequentialism, virtue ethics)
- Comprehensive Relation to Site Perspective (all five tenets substantively engaged)
- Institutional implications insights about agency-constraining vs agency-cultivating institutions
- Compatibilism engagement (Frankfurt, Fischer/Ravizza, Wolf)
- Buddhist moral philosophy acknowledgment
- Falsifiability section

### Enhancements Made
- Fixed Wolf's view from "reason-responsiveness" to "Reason View" for attribution accuracy
- Rephrased "not X but Y" pattern instance for style guide compliance
- Added outbound cross-link to responsibility-gradient-from-attentional-capacity in Further Reading

## Remaining Items

None. The article is in good shape after two reviews. The orphan status has been resolved through comprehensive cross-linking.

## Stability Notes

- The six adversarial personas will always find this article's positions objectionable—it grounds moral categories in agent causation, which eliminative materialists, hard determinists, and MWI defenders reject. These are bedrock philosophical disagreements, not fixable problems.
- The compatibilism engagement is adequate. Compatibilists will always argue their framework is sufficient. The article's response (pragmatic vs metaphysical desert) is a genuine philosophical position, not a gap to be filled.
- The phenomenological claim that "moral seriousness tracks reality" is acknowledged in the falsifiability section as a consistency check rather than evidence. This is an honest limitation, not a flaw to fix.
- The Wolf attribution is now consistent with the apex article's usage. No further review needed on this point.
- The article has reached stability after two reviews. Future reviews should not re-flag bedrock disagreements or previously addressed issues.
