title: Deep Review - Moral Implications of Genuine Agency
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-23
**Article**: [Moral Implications of Genuine Agency](/topics/moral-implications-of-genuine-agency/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Spinoza mischaracterized as "hard determinist"**: Spinoza was a necessitarian with nuanced views on moral emotions, not a hard determinist in the modern (James/Pereboom) sense. Replaced with d'Holbach, a straightforward hard determinist.
- **Quasi-quote inaccuracy**: Direct quotation marks around a paraphrase from moral-responsibility article ("we are not" vs source's "We're not"). Converted to indirect attribution.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Inadequate compatibilism engagement**: Single dismissive sentence about compatibilism was insufficient for a 2000+ word article on moral agency. Expanded to engage Frankfurt, Fischer/Ravizza, and Wolf by name, acknowledging their strengths while articulating the Map's specific disagreement (pragmatic vs metaphysical desert). Resolution: applied.
- **Quantum mechanism stated without qualification**: "consciousness selects among quantum-indeterminate neural states" stated as flat fact, inconsistent with how tenets.md and moral-responsibility.md handle the same claim. Added qualification noting speculative status and linking to minimal quantum interaction tenet. Resolution: applied.
- **Missing Buddhist engagement**: Article claimed genuine agency is necessary for moral seriousness while ignoring a major tradition (Buddhist moral philosophy) that achieves moral seriousness without irreducible agency. Added acknowledgment in character section. Resolution: applied.
- **Error theory argument contained non sequitur**: Moved from "agents are real causes" to "normative claims about agency track facts" without bridging argument. Added the bridging step: agent causation involves reasons-responsive selection, which normative evaluation can target. Also acknowledged Mackie's queerness argument as a separate challenge. Resolution: applied.
- **Overreliance on "not X but Y" pattern**: Six instances of the pattern the style guide warns against. Revised 3 instances to make positive claims directly. Resolution: partially applied.
- **No falsifiability section**: Unlike the moral-responsibility article, no "What Would Challenge This View?" section. Added brief falsifiability section. Resolution: applied.
- **Unused references**: Kane, O'Connor cited but not mentioned in text. Removed and replaced with Fischer/Ravizza and Mackie (now cited in text), plus d'Holbach. Williams integrated into body text. Resolution: applied.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Compatibilism provides everything genuine agency claims**: Addressed by expanding compatibilism engagement and articulating the specific limitation from the Map's perspective (pragmatic vs metaphysical grounding of desert).
- **Buddhist moral cultivation without selfhood**: Addressed by acknowledging the Buddhist counterexample and clarifying what genuine agency adds (authorship, not mere possibility of cultivation).
- **Is-ought gap (agency doesn't entail norms)**: Addressed by adding bridging argument about reasons-responsive selection being a legitimate target of normative evaluation.
- **Error theory's queerness argument**: Acknowledged as a separate challenge genuine agency doesn't directly answer.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening framing ("responses to facts about what conscious beings actually do")
- "Peculiar consolation" of determinism and its removal
- Nagel moral luck taxonomy engagement with precise elimination of fourth category
- "The 'ought' has a real addressee" formulation
- Aristotle/hexis integration
- Three-part moral theory demands structure (error theory, consequentialism, virtue ethics)
- Relation to Site Perspective section (all five tenets substantively applied)
- Institutional implications insights about agency-constraining vs agency-cultivating institutions

### Enhancements Made
- Expanded compatibilism engagement with Frankfurt, Fischer/Ravizza, Wolf
- Added quantum mechanism qualification with tenet cross-link
- Added Buddhist moral philosophy acknowledgment
- Strengthened error theory argument with bridging step and Mackie acknowledgment
- Added falsifiability section
- Reduced "not X but Y" pattern in 3 instances
- Integrated Williams into moral luck body text

### Cross-links Added
- [reasons-responsiveness](/concepts/reasons-responsiveness/) (in Obligation section)
- [tenets](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) (in Obligation section, quantum qualification)
- [consciousness-value-connection](/concepts/consciousness-value-connection/) (in Institutional section)
- [diachronic-agency-and-personal-narrative](/topics/diachronic-agency-and-personal-narrative/) (in Character section)

## Remaining Items

- The phenomenology of moral seriousness section could be deepened with material from phenomenology-of-moral-experience (Simone Weil on attention as moral generosity, temporal phenomenology of deliberation). Deferred as the section is functional and the article is at a good length.
- The institutional implications section could be expanded with connections to process philosophy (Whitehead on education as development of novel experience). Deferred as the section makes its key points effectively.
- No inbound links from other articles yet (article is brand new). Integration will happen naturally as cross-reviews run.

## Stability Notes

- The six adversarial personas will always find this article's positions objectionable—it grounds moral categories in agent causation, which eliminative materialists, hard determinists, and MWI defenders reject. These are bedrock philosophical disagreements, not fixable problems.
- The compatibilism engagement is now adequate but not exhaustive. Compatibilists will always argue their framework is sufficient. The article's response (pragmatic vs metaphysical desert) is a genuine philosophical position, not a gap to be filled.
- The phenomenological claim that "moral seriousness tracks reality" is acknowledged in the falsifiability section as a consistency check rather than evidence. This is an honest limitation, not a flaw to fix.
