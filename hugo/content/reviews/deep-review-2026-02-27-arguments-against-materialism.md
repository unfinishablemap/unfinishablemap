title: Deep Review - Arguments Against Materialism
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-27
**Article**: [Arguments Against Materialism](/topics/arguments-against-materialism/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-20](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-20-arguments-against-materialism/) (article was completely rewritten since; previous additions not present)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Personas Applied

1. **Eliminative Materialist (Churchland)**: Article assumes phenomenal consciousness is real without engaging eliminativist challenge directly. Low issue — the concept articles handle this.
2. **Hard-Nosed Physicalist (Dennett)**: Functionalism was dismissed in a parenthetical; needed expansion. Medium issue — addressed.
3. **Quantum Skeptic (Tegmark)**: Quantum mentions are brief and appropriately constrained to tenet references. No issue for this article's scope.
4. **Many-Worlds Defender (Deutsch)**: MWI not engaged, but appropriately deferred to other articles. Low issue.
5. **Empiricist (Popper)**: No falsifiability section. Medium issue — addressed with "What Would Challenge This View?" section.
6. **Buddhist Philosopher (Nagarjuna)**: Assumes substantial self throughout. Low issue — bedrock philosophical difference with the Map's dualist framework.

### Critical Issues Found

None. All attributions verified accurate:
- PhilPapers 2020 survey: ~52% physicalism (verified against Bourget & Chalmers 2023)
- Plantinga's EAAN: accurately characterised from *Warrant and Proper Function* (1993)
- McGinn's mysterianism: accurately characterised from "Can We Solve the Mind-Body Problem?" (1989)
- All philosopher attributions (Jackson, Kripke, Nagel, Levine) verified against cited works

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Functionalism dismissed in parenthetical**: "redefines it (functionalism)" gave the dominant materialist position no engagement.
   - **Resolution**: Expanded to distinguish functional analysis from qualitative character, added [phenomenal-concepts-strategy](/concepts/phenomenal-concepts-strategy/) as a fourth materialist strategy.

2. **No falsifiability section**: No acknowledgment of what would weaken the convergence case.
   - **Resolution**: Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section with three specific conditions.

3. **Shared-premise objection unaddressed**: The convergence argument could be challenged by claiming the arguments share a common flaw.
   - **Resolution**: Added paragraph explicitly addressing this objection, noting the diversity of premises (information, logic, normativity, unity, qualia).

### Counterarguments Considered

- Shared-premise objection to convergence: addressed with premise-diversity response
- Falsifiability concern: addressed with three specific weakening conditions
- Functionalist response: expanded beyond parenthetical dismissal

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Opening two paragraphs: clear thesis with appropriate scope ("not by detailing each argument... but by examining why the cumulative case is powerful")
- "Persistence of Materialism" section: genuinely original framing (institutional momentum, parsimony illusion, fear of alternative, misplaced confidence)
- "What the Arguments Actually Show": philosophically careful — arguments rule out physicalism, don't prove dualism
- Self-undermining problem: well-structured with appropriate Plantinga connection
- Water/Napoleonic wars analogy: effective and memorable
- Relation to Site Perspective: substantive, connects to multiple tenets

### Enhancements Made

1. **Shared-premise response**: Added paragraph addressing the objection that convergent arguments might share a hidden flaw
2. **Phenomenal concepts strategy**: Added as fourth materialist strategy alongside eliminativism, functionalism, and future science
3. **"What Would Challenge This View?" section**: Three specific conditions that would weaken the anti-materialist case
4. **Causal closure cross-link**: Added [causal-closure](/concepts/causal-closure/) link in self-undermining section

### Cross-links Added

- [phenomenal-concepts-strategy](/concepts/phenomenal-concepts-strategy/)
- [causal-closure](/concepts/causal-closure/)

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues addressed.

## Stability Notes

- The article was completely rewritten on 2026-02-27, replacing the version reviewed on 2026-01-20. The rewrite dropped all previous review additions (expanded illusionism, decoherence section, MWI engagement, falsifiability section, mysterian alternative, introspection section). The new version takes a higher-level survey approach rather than detailed engagement with each objection — this is a valid structural choice that delegates detailed treatment to concept articles.
- Eliminativism and type-B materialism get minimal engagement — these are philosophical standpoint differences handled by the concept articles ([illusionism](/concepts/illusionism/), [materialism](/concepts/materialism/)), not flaws in this survey article.
- Buddhist/process philosophy perspectives will always find the substantial-self assumption unsatisfying — this is a bedrock commitment of the Map's dualist framework.
