title: Deep Review - QBism (Quantum Bayesianism)
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-01-28
**Article**: [QBism (Quantum Bayesianism)](/concepts/qbism/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-28 (earlier today)](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-28-qbism/)

## Review Context

This article was already reviewed earlier today (2026-01-28T22:30:00+00:00). The previous review found no critical issues and marked several philosophical disagreements as bedrock issues that should not be re-flagged. The article had not been modified since that review.

Per the convergence principle, this follow-up review focused on:
1. Verifying the previous review's improvements hold up
2. Identifying any cross-linking opportunities missed previously
3. Confirming stability

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article remains well-structured with all required sections, no factual errors, no internal contradictions, and follows the style guide.

### Medium Issues Found
None new. Issues from the previous review remain addressed:
- MWI indexical objection: Still adequately developed with both the MWI defender response and Map rejoinder
- Structural gap explanation: Still clearly explains why QBism's consciousness gap is structural not incidental

### Low Issues Found
None new.

### Counterarguments Considered
All major counterarguments from the previous review remain addressed. No new counterarguments identified.

### Bedrock Disagreements (Not Issues)
Per previous review, these represent fundamental philosophical disagreements with the Map's dualist tenets and should NOT be re-flagged:
1. Eliminativists objecting to the experience/correlate distinction
2. MWI defenders finding the indexical objection unmotivated
3. Dennett-style functionalists objecting to the Nagelian framework

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- "Agent Problem" section structure and argumentation
- "First-Person Gap" section connecting to haecceity
- The key insight: "has located the mystery rather than dissolved it"
- The nuanced tenet connections in "Relation to Site Perspective"
- The explanation of why QBism's gap is "structural rather than incidental"
- Existing cross-links to measurement-problem, relational-quantum-mechanics, haecceity, hard-problem-of-consciousness, many-worlds

### Enhancements Made
- Added cross-link to [phenomenal-unity](/phenomenal-unity/) in the "Agent Problem" section, noting that QBism's agents must have unified experiences to hold coherent beliefs
- Added [phenomenal-unity](/phenomenal-unity/) and [neural-binding-mechanisms](/neural-binding-mechanisms/) to Further Reading section

### Cross-links Added
- [phenomenal-unity](/phenomenal-unity/) (new, in Agent Problem section and Further Reading)
- [neural-binding-mechanisms](/neural-binding-mechanisms/) (new, in Further Reading)

## Word Count
- Before: 1757 words
- After: 1787 words (+30 words, +2%)
- Status: 71% of soft threshold (2500), well within limits

## Remaining Items
None. The article has reached stability.

## Stability Notes

This is the second review of this article today. The article was already at a stable state from the first review. This follow-up review confirms:

1. **No critical or medium issues** - The article is structurally sound
2. **No changes to core content** - Only minor cross-link additions
3. **Bedrock disagreements documented** - Future reviews should not re-flag eliminativist, MWI defender, or functionalist objections as issues

**Convergence achieved.** The article should not require further deep review unless:
- New content is added
- Related concept pages are created that warrant cross-linking
- Factual errors are discovered in the references

The philosophical disagreements noted in stability notes are inherent to the Map's dualist position and will never be "resolved" - they are features of the perspective, not bugs to fix.
