**Date**: 2026-02-04
**Article**: [Why Attention Schema Theory Fails](/topics/attention-schema-theory-critique/)
**Previous review**: [2026-02-01](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-01-attention-schema-theory-critique/)

## Context

This review was triggered by orphan integration—the article had no inbound links. The focus was on finding related articles that should link to this content and adding cross-references to integrate it into site navigation.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. Previous review addressed all substantive issues.

### Medium Issues Found
None new. The article is well-structured and argumentatively sound.

### Counterarguments Considered
All major objections from the six adversarial personas (eliminative materialist, hard-nosed physicalist, quantum skeptic, many-worlds defender, empiricist, Buddhist philosopher) were considered. The previous review already noted that philosophical disagreements from these perspectives are bedrock standoffs, not flaws to fix.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear four-option regress structure
- Strong phenomenological arguments (effort, witness consciousness)
- Honest "What AST Gets Right" section
- Epistemic humility in "What Would Change This Assessment"

### Enhancements Made
- Updated `last_deep_review` timestamp

### Cross-links Added (Primary Focus)

Added inbound links from 5 articles:

1. **[attention-schema-theory](/concepts/attention-schema-theory/)** — Added to `related_articles` frontmatter; now explicitly links to the critique
2. **[illusionism](/concepts/illusionism/)** — Updated AST section to reference the critique for detailed analysis
3. **[global-workspace-theory](/concepts/global-workspace-theory/)** — Added link in the Attention Schema Theory subsection
4. **[heterophenomenology](/concepts/heterophenomenology/)** — Added link in the illusionism connection section
5. **[attention-as-interface](/concepts/attention-as-interface/)** — Added link in the illusionist challenge section
6. **[mental-effort](/concepts/mental-effort/)** — Added link in the illusionist challenge section

## Remaining Items

None. The article is now well-integrated into the site's navigation structure.

## Stability Notes

This article reached stability after its first review. The philosophical disagreements noted previously remain:

- **Eliminativists will object to "seeming requires a subject"** — Bedrock disagreement about phenomenality's reality
- **Pattern identity defenders will reject haecceity argument** — Philosophical commitment, not oversight
- **Quantum skeptics find Zeno speculation unpersuasive** — Presented as speculation; arguments don't depend on it

No further content changes warranted. Future reviews should focus on maintaining cross-references as new related content is added.

## Word Count

2808 words (94% of 3000 soft threshold) — No changes to word count; cross-reference additions were to other articles.
