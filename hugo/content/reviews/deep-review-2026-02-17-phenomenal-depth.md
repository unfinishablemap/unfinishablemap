title: Deep Review - Phenomenal Depth
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-17
**Article**: [Phenomenal Depth](/concepts/phenomenal-depth/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None. The article is well-structured and factually sound.

### Medium Issues Found
- [Missing References section]: Added references for pain asymbolia (Berthier et al. 1988), contemplative training (Lutz et al. 2008), cognitive phenomenology (Siewert 1998), and the explanatory gap (Levine 1983).
- [Zombie argument under-defended in tenet section]: The article asserted that a zombie would lack depth's downstream influence without engaging the functionalist reply. Added engagement: the functionalist concession that behaviour is identical without depth leads to epiphenomenalism, which faces its own self-undermining problems.
- [Missing cross-links]: Added links to [mysterianism](/concepts/mysterianism/) and [panpsychism](/concepts/panpsychism/) where the article's arguments naturally connect.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist**: Depth may be an artifact of how brains process information, not an ontological feature. Response: the article operates from the site's dualist framework; this is a bedrock disagreement.
- **Dennettian functionalist**: "Depth" and "layers" may be metaphors without precise definition. Response: the examples (orchestra, peach, pain) provide concrete instances that give the concept empirical grounding.
- **Functionalist reply to zombie argument**: If functional profile is identical, behaviour must be identical. Resolution: addressed in revision — this leads to epiphenomenalism, which is self-undermining.
- **Constructivist view of attention**: Attention constructs rather than reveals layers. Response: the article's claim that layers are "present" before attention is a philosophical position consistent with the site's framework.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Orchestra example — vivid and immediately intuitive
- Breadth/depth distinction from phenomenal overflow — genuinely useful conceptual clarification
- Peach example for perceptual depth — concrete and effective
- Pain asymbolia as evidence of dissociable layers
- Gradient framing (depth admits of degree) — avoids binary thinking
- Clean structure: definition → modalities → reduction → access → minimal consciousness → tenets

### Enhancements Made
- Connected inexhaustibility of depth to [mysterianism](/concepts/mysterianism/) — depth provides a concrete way in which consciousness might exceed cognitive grasp
- Connected the depth gradient to [panpsychist](/concepts/panpsychism/) intuitions (while noting the Map doesn't commit to panpsychism)
- Strengthened zombie argument with engagement of the functionalist reply and its epiphenomenalist consequences
- Added References section with four citations supporting factual claims
- Added [mysterianism](/concepts/mysterianism/) to Further Reading and frontmatter concepts
- Added [panpsychism](/concepts/panpsychism/) and [epiphenomenalism](/arguments/epiphenomenalism/) to frontmatter concepts

### Cross-links Added
- [mysterianism](/concepts/mysterianism/)
- [panpsychism](/concepts/panpsychism/)
- [epiphenomenalism](/arguments/epiphenomenalism/)

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues were addressed.

## Stability Notes

- The eliminative materialist and Dennettian objections (that "depth" is a metaphor or cognitive artifact) represent bedrock disagreements with the site's dualist framework. Future reviews should NOT re-flag these as critical.
- The constructivist view of attention (that attention constructs rather than reveals) is a legitimate alternative interpretation. The article's position is defensible within the site's framework and need not be re-argued in future reviews.
