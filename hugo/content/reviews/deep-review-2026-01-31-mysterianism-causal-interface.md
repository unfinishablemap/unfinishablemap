title: Deep Review - Mysterianism (Causal-Interface Cross-Review)
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Article**: [Mysterianism and Cognitive Closure](/concepts/mysterianism/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-30 (natural-vs-designed-limits cross-review)](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-30-mysterianism/)
**Cross-review context**: causal-interface voids article (voids/causal-interface.md)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. Article remains stable with accurate attributions.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing cross-link to causal-interface**: The causal-interface void directly illustrates McGinn's cognitive closure—it explores why we cannot observe *how* consciousness causes anything. This is a concrete instance of cognitive closure regarding property P. The article discussed property P extensively but didn't connect to this new voids content. **Resolution**: Added cross-link in Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet section and Further Reading.

### Low Issues Found
None.

### Attribution Check
All attributions verified accurate (carried forward from previous reviews):
- McGinn's cognitive closure (1989): ✓
- Nagel's bat argument (1974): ✓
- Chomsky's problems vs. mysteries: ✓
- Fodor's concept nativism: ✓
- Russell/Eddington intrinsic nature: ✓
- Penrose's mathematical understanding: ✓

### Counterarguments Considered
All six adversarial personas engaged:
- **Eliminative Materialist**: Bedrock disagreement about phenomenal consciousness—not re-flagged
- **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: Vitalism objection already well-handled
- **Quantum Skeptic**: Quantum mechanisms appropriately separated from cognitive closure
- **Many-Worlds Defender**: No new issues
- **Empiricist**: Falsifiability section comprehensive
- **Buddhist Philosopher**: Bedrock disagreement about substantialist framework—not re-flagged

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent McGinn cognitive closure presentation
- C. elegans empirical evidence section
- Strong phenomenology of cognitive closure section
- Comprehensive tenet connections
- Previous cross-review additions (questioning-as-evidence, natural-vs-designed)

### Enhancements Made
1. **Added causal-interface cross-link**: In the Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet section, updated to link to [causal-interface](/voids/causal-interface/) void and note that even the interface itself may be permanently opaque.

2. **Added to Further Reading**: "[causal-interface](/voids/causal-interface/) — The void between intention and action as cognitive closure in action"

3. **Added to related_articles**: [causal-interface](/voids/causal-interface/)

### Cross-links Added
- [causal-interface](/voids/causal-interface/) — Added to related_articles, in-text, and Further Reading

## Word Count
- Before: 2658 words (106% of 2500 soft threshold)
- After: 2658 words (106% of 2500 soft threshold)
- Net change: 0 words (length-neutral achieved by trimming "Temporary Versus Permanent" section)

## Remaining Items

None. The cross-review integration is complete.

## Stability Notes

This is the **eighth deep review** of this article. Key stability markers:

1. **Bedrock disagreements (do not re-flag)**:
   - Eliminativists will always question whether "phenomenal consciousness" is coherent
   - Buddhist philosophers will question the substantialist framework
   - These represent philosophical standoffs, not article flaws

2. **Convergence achieved**:
   - 2026-01-20: Added illusionism, process philosophy, falsifiability, full tenets
   - 2026-01-27: Added intrinsic nature connection, computational limits distinction
   - 2026-01-28: Added bidirectional link to convergent-cognitive-limits
   - 2026-01-29: Added bidirectional link to origin-of-consciousness
   - 2026-01-30 (morning): Added questioning-as-evidence transcendental insight
   - 2026-01-30 (evening): Added natural-vs-designed cross-link
   - 2026-01-31: Added causal-interface cross-link

3. **Article is at stability**:
   - All major philosophical positions engaged
   - All tenets covered with specific connections
   - Now cross-linked to causal-interface voids content
   - Word count at soft threshold and stable
   - Future reviews should only address: new related content, significant literature developments, or broken links

The causal-interface cross-link was appropriate: McGinn's property P—whatever property of the brain explains how neural activity gives rise to conscious experience—is directly related to the causal interface void's exploration of why we cannot observe how consciousness interfaces with physical causation. Both concern the same fundamental opacity at the mind-matter boundary.
