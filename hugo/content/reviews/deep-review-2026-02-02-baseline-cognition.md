title: Deep Review - Baseline Cognition
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Article**: [Baseline Cognition](/concepts/baseline-cognition/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-27](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-27-baseline-cognition/)
**Context**: Task flagged orphan integration, but article has 27 inbound links—well integrated.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Six adversarial personas reviewed the document:

### Eliminative Materialist (Churchland)
- The baseline/conscious distinction may track functional differences rather than phenomenal states
- *Assessment*: Medium issue; addressed in prior review via illusionism section; response adequate

### Hard-Nosed Physicalist (Dennett)
- Procedural/declarative distinction doesn't necessarily map to unconscious/conscious
- *Assessment*: Medium issue; addressed in illusionism section with argument from reason

### Quantum Skeptic (Tegmark)
- Quantum mechanisms appropriately hedged ("doesn't require quantum mechanisms")
- *Assessment*: Low; no issues

### Many-Worlds Defender (Deutsch)
- "Settling" argument articulated; this remains bedrock disagreement
- *Assessment*: N/A (philosophical standoff, not fixable flaw)

### Empiricist (Popper)
- Randeniya (2025) meta-analysis cited in text but missing from References
- *Assessment*: **Critical issue**—citation gap

### Buddhist Philosopher (Nagarjuna)
- Article acknowledges degrees/kinds of consciousness
- *Assessment*: Low; appropriately nuanced

### Critical Issues Found
1. **Missing citation**: Randeniya (2025) meta-analysis cited in text (line 91) but absent from References section
   - *Resolution*: Added full citation to References

### Medium Issues Found
None new. Prior review issues remain addressed.

### Counterarguments Considered
All major counterarguments were already addressed in prior reviews (illusionism, epiphenomenalism).

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

Six sympathetic personas reviewed the document:

### Property Dualist (Chalmers)
- Opening clearly distinguishes phenomenal from access consciousness
- Systematic correspondence argument well-articulated

### Quantum Mind Theorist (Stapp)
- Appropriately cautious about quantum mechanisms

### Phenomenologist (Nagel)
- Procedural/declarative distinction is phenomenologically precise
- "Experience without experiencing that they experience" is a strong formulation

### Process Philosopher (Whitehead)
- Contemplative Perspectives section engages Whitehead substantively

### Libertarian Free Will Defender (Kane)
- Free will implications section makes connection explicit

### Mysterian (McGinn)
- Epistemic limits acknowledged appropriately
- "What Would Challenge This View?" section demonstrates intellectual honesty

### Strengths Preserved
- Core hypothesis articulation in opening
- Domain-by-domain evidence structure
- Illusionism and epiphenomenalism challenge sections
- All five tenet connections
- Tables for procedural/declarative distinction and theory of mind levels

### Enhancements Made
- Added missing Randeniya (2025) citation to References section

### Cross-links Status
Article has 27 inbound links from content files—not orphaned. Well-integrated into site.

## Length Check

**Before**: 3315 words (133% of 2500 soft threshold)
**After**: ~3330 words (minimal change from citation addition)
**Status**: Soft warning (below hard threshold of 3500)

Operated in length-neutral mode: only added necessary citation.

## Remaining Items

None. The article is stable after four reviews. This review confirmed:
- The only issue was a missing citation, now resolved
- No critical philosophical issues remain
- Counterarguments are adequately addressed
- Tenet connections are complete
- Article is well-integrated (27 inbound links)

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed four times (2026-01-22, 2026-01-25, 2026-01-27, 2026-02-02). The only issue found was a technical citation gap. Key philosophical disagreements noted in previous reviews remain bedrock standoffs:

- **MWI proponents** will continue to find the "settling" argument unsatisfying—this is a bedrock disagreement about what selection means, not a fixable flaw.
- **Eliminative materialists** will object that "consciousness" may not carve nature at joints—the article's illusionism response addresses this but cannot resolve fundamental ontological disagreements.
- **Hard physicalists** can always retreat to "it's functional all the way down"—the argument from reason provides the Map's response but won't convince committed functionalists.

These are expected philosophical standoffs given the Map's tenet commitments. Future reviews should not re-flag them as critical issues. The article has reached maturity.
