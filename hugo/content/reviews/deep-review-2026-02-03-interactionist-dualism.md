title: Deep Review - Interactionist Dualism
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Article**: [Interactionist Dualism](/archive/arguments/interactionist-dualism/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-31](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-31-interactionist-dualism/)
**Review type**: Cross-review considering delegatory dualism insights

## Context

This review was triggered as a cross-review to verify that delegatory dualism insights are properly integrated into the interactionist-dualism concept page. The previous four reviews (2026-01-19, 2026-01-25, 2026-01-29, 2026-01-31) have established article stability.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Six adversarial philosopher personas examined the document:

### Critical Issues Found
**None.** The article accurately represents delegatory dualism and doesn't misattribute claims to Saad.

### Attribution Accuracy Check

Verified the following claims against the delegatory-dualism source article:

| Claim | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Delegatory dualism rejects premise 3 (non-overdetermination) | Accurate |
| Physical states delegate to experiences sharing causal profiles | Accurate |
| Preemption vs. duplication distinction | Accurate |
| Universal vs. observational closure distinction | Accurate |

**Minor note**: "causal profiles" simplifies Saad's "default causal profiles," but this is acceptable for a summary; the link to delegatory-dualism provides full detail.

### Medium Issues Considered (Not Addressed)

- The delegation response could explicitly note that observational closure means no distinctive empirical predictions. However, this is already implicit and would add length to a well-structured section.

### Counterarguments Previously Addressed
All prior resolutions from previous reviews remain intact:
- Dennett's heterophenomenology objection
- Eliminativism
- Decoherence objection
- Conservation law objection
- Exclusion argument (via quantum + delegation responses)

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

Six sympathetic philosopher personas examined the document:

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening summary front-loads core position effectively
- Seven converging arguments structure remains clear
- Psychophysical laws framework (supervenience vs. causal laws)
- Two-response structure to exclusion argument (quantum + delegation)
- Agent causation framing with causal-interface acknowledgment
- Self-stultification argument against epiphenomenalism
- Falsifiability section's honest treatment
- Delegatory dualism integration (accurate attribution to Saad 2025)
- Observational closure cross-link

### Delegatory Dualism Integration Status

The integration from the 2026-01-29 review is complete and accurate:
- Delegatory dualism is listed in frontmatter concepts
- The Causal Closure Argument section includes the delegation response
- Saad is properly credited
- The connection to observational closure is present
- The Further Reading section includes delegatory-dualism

### Potential Enhancements (Deferred)

- The connection between delegation and introspective reliability could reinforce the self-stultification argument. However, this connection is implicit and adding it would not significantly improve the already well-structured article.

## Changes Made

**Content**: None. The article is stable and the delegatory dualism integration is complete.

**Frontmatter only**:
- Updated `ai_modified` timestamp
- Updated `last_deep_review` timestamp

### Word Count
- Current: 2250 words (90% of 2500-word soft threshold)
- Change: No change (frontmatter update only)

## Remaining Items

None. The cross-review objective (verify delegatory dualism integration) confirms the integration is accurate and complete.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed **five times** (2026-01-19, 2026-01-25, 2026-01-29, 2026-01-31, 2026-02-03) and is stable:

- **Delegatory dualism integration complete**: Saad's 2025 theory is accurately represented. Attribution is correct. The delegation/observational-closure framework is properly linked.

- **No content changes needed**: After four substantive reviews and one verification review, the article has converged. Future reviews finding "no issues" is a success, not a failure.

- **Healthy length**: At 2250 words (90% of soft threshold), the article has room for future cross-links if needed.

- **Philosophical disagreements are expected**: Adversarial personas from materialist, physicalist, or MWI perspectives will continue to find the interactionist position unsatisfying. These represent fundamental philosophical standoffs, not fixable flaws.

Future reviews should focus on factual accuracy when new related content is created, not on seeking structural changes to this stable article.
