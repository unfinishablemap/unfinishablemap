title: Deep Review - Consciousness and Pain

**Date**: 2026-02-27
**Article**: [Consciousness and Pain](/topics/why-pain-hurts/)
**Previous review**: [2026-02-18](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-18-consciousness-and-pain/)

## Status: Archived Article — Link Cleanup

The article `consciousness-and-pain.md` was **archived on 2026-02-22** and coalesced into [Why Pain Hurts: Phenomenal Character and Causal Power](/topics/why-pain-hurts/). The archive metadata shows:

- `archived: true`
- `superseded_by: "/topics/why-pain-hurts/"`
- `archive_reason: "Coalesced into Why Pain Hurts: Phenomenal Character and Causal Power"`

The "orphan" status flagged by the automation was caused by stale wikilinks — live content files were still linking to the old `[consciousness-and-pain](/topics/why-pain-hurts/)` path instead of the replacement `[why-pain-hurts](/topics/why-pain-hurts/)`.

## Stale Links Found and Fixed

### Content Files Updated (6 files, 12 link instances)

1. **concepts/pain-asymbolia.md** — Updated topics frontmatter and Further Reading link
2. **concepts/valence.md** — Updated Further Reading link
3. **topics/phenomenal-normativity-environmental-ethics.md** — Updated related_articles frontmatter, inline link in factory farming section, and Further Reading link (3 instances)
4. **topics/placebo-effect-and-mental-causation.md** — Updated related_articles frontmatter and inline link
5. **topics/suffering-versus-pain.md** — Updated topics frontmatter and Further Reading link
6. **topics/pain-asymbolia-as-central-test-case.md** — Updated topics frontmatter; removed redundant Further Reading entry (already had `[why-pain-hurts](/topics/why-pain-hurts/)` listed)

### Additional Files Updated (2 files)

7. **voids/valence-void.md** — Updated topics frontmatter
8. **research/voids-valence-void-2026-02-18.md** — Updated topics frontmatter

### Files Not Updated (correct — historical records)

- Reviews, changelogs, and todo.md entries referencing `[consciousness-and-pain](/topics/why-pain-hurts/)` were left unchanged as they are historical records of past activity.

## No Content Changes to Archived Article

The archived article itself was not modified — it is preserved as-is with its archive metadata. The superseding article `why-pain-hurts.md` already incorporates all content from `consciousness-and-pain.md` (plus `phenomenology-of-pain.md`) and has received its own deep reviews (2026-02-23, 2026-02-23b).

## Remaining Items

- The article `phenomenology-of-pain.md` was also coalesced into `why-pain-hurts` — its stale links may need similar cleanup in a future pass.

## Stability Notes

- This review addressed a structural issue (stale links to archived content) rather than content quality. No further reviews of the archived `consciousness-and-pain.md` are needed — future reviews should target the live `why-pain-hurts.md` instead.
