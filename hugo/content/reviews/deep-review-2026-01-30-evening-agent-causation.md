title: Deep Review - Agent Causation (Cross-Review)
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-01-30 (evening)
**Article**: [Agent Causation](/concepts/agent-causation/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-30 (morning)](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-30-agent-causation/)
**Context**: Cross-review considering authentic-vs-inauthentic-choice.md

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. Article remains stable after morning review.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing cross-link to authentic-vs-inauthentic-choice**: The new article directly discusses when agent causation is engaged (authentic choice) versus when it's bypassed (inauthentic/automatic choice). [Resolution: Added cross-link in concepts frontmatter, inline reference in luck objection response, and Further Reading entry]

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist**: Bedrock disagreement (noted in previous review)
- **Heterophenomenologist**: Bedrock disagreement (noted in previous review)
- **Quantum skeptic**: Previously addressed; no new issues
- **Many-worlds defender**: Appropriately cross-linked; bedrock disagreement
- **Buddhist philosopher**: Whitehead section provides alternative framing
- **Empiricist**: Falsifiability section remains strong

### Attribution Check
No attribution errors. All philosopher citations are appropriate.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Two-domain convergence argument (attention + motor selection)
- Kane's 2024 evolution and sourcehood treatment
- Creative generation section (beyond pure selection)
- Comprehensive falsifiability section
- Skill delegation and choking evidence
- Retrocausal deepening of sourcehood

### Enhancements Made
1. **Added authentic-vs-inauthentic-choice cross-link**: Integrated the new authenticity article's insight that agent causation has variable engagement—fully active in authentic choice, attenuated in scripted behavior
2. **Enriched luck objection response**: Added note that authenticity dimension shows selection function isn't uniform across all actions
3. **Updated Further Reading**: Added entry pointing to when agent causation is engaged vs. attenuated

### Cross-links Added
- [authentic-vs-inauthentic-choice](/topics/authentic-vs-inauthentic-choice/)

## Remaining Items

None. This cross-review integrated the new authenticity content appropriately.

## Stability Notes

This is the third review of this article (second today). The article has reached good stability. The morning review found no critical issues; this evening cross-review's only finding was a natural cross-link to new content.

Bedrock philosophical disagreements remain:
- Eliminativists reject "consciousness" as a natural kind exercising causal powers
- Heterophenomenologists question reliance on phenomenology as metaphysical evidence
- MWI proponents reject collapse-based frameworks

These are fundamental philosophical disagreements. The article engages them fairly. Future reviews should not re-flag these as critical issues.
