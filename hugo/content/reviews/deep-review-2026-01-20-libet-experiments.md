title: Deep Review - Libet Experiments and the Neuroscience of Volition
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-01-20
**Article**: [Libet Experiments](/concepts/libet-experiments/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **No falsifiability section** — The article lacked a "What Would Challenge This View?" section specifying what evidence would undermine The Unfinishable Map's interpretation.
   - **Resolution**: Added comprehensive falsifiability section with six specific conditions.

2. **Weak illusionism engagement** — The article didn't engage with Daniel Dennett's illusionist interpretation of Libet.
   - **Resolution**: Added "The Illusionist Response" section with self-refutation counter-argument.

3. **Decoherence gap** — The quantum/retrocausal sections didn't address the decoherence objection.
   - **Resolution**: Added "The Decoherence Challenge" subsection with three-part response.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Missing cross-link to luck-objection.md** — The Libet challenge directly parallels the luck objection.
   - **Resolution**: Added to frontmatter and Further Reading, integrated into veto regress discussion.

2. **Missing cross-link to decoherence.md** — The quantum sections needed decoherence engagement.
   - **Resolution**: Added to frontmatter and Further Reading.

3. **Missing cross-link to voluntary-attention.md** — Related stochastic pre-state discussion.
   - **Resolution**: Added to frontmatter and Further Reading.

4. **Missing cross-link to illusionism.md** — Major competitor interpretation.
   - **Resolution**: Added to frontmatter and Further Reading.

5. **Veto regress objection needed stronger engagement** — The infinite regress challenge wasn't fully addressed.
   - **Resolution**: Added "The Veto Regress and Its Resolution" subsection.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Eliminative materialist**: The 60% prediction accuracy could reflect measurement limitations, not gaps for consciousness.
  - **Response**: This is empirically open, but Schurger's work shows the RP may not be a decision signal at all.

- **Hard-nosed physicalist (Dennett)**: The timing question presupposes Cartesian theatre.
  - **Response**: Added direct engagement with this view in illusionism section, including self-refutation argument.

- **Quantum skeptic (Tegmark)**: Decoherence kills quantum effects in neural timescales.
  - **Response**: Added decoherence challenge section with three responses (measurement problem remains, Zeno mechanism, quantum biology evidence).

- **Many-Worlds defender**: Retrocausality assumes collapse is real.
  - **Response**: Noted in falsifiability section; site's No Many Worlds tenet already addresses this.

- **Buddhist philosopher**: The article assumes substantial self that selects.
  - **Response**: Added process philosophy section (Whitehead's actual occasions) as alternative framing.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

1. The Schurger/Sjöberg critique is well-documented and devastating to the standard interpretation
2. The Desmurget dissociation evidence is powerful and rarely cited
3. The selection vs. initiation framing is clear and philosophically productive
4. The retrocausal resolution is a distinctive site contribution
5. The connection to 60% prediction accuracy as "gap for consciousness" is insightful

### Enhancements Made

1. **Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section** — Six specific falsification conditions
2. **Added "The Illusionist Response" section** — Engages Dennett with self-refutation counter
3. **Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section** — Whitehead's actual occasions framing
4. **Added "The Veto Regress and Its Resolution" subsection** — Resolves infinite regress via atemporal selection
5. **Added "The Decoherence Challenge" subsection** — Three-part response to quantum skepticism

### Cross-links Added

- [voluntary-attention](/voluntary-attention/) — The willed/instructed distinction and stochastic pre-state challenge
- [luck-objection](/concepts/luck-objection/) — Why indeterminism doesn't reduce selection to randomness
- [decoherence](/concepts/decoherence/) — The decoherence challenge and biological quantum effects
- [illusionism](/concepts/illusionism/) — The eliminativist interpretation and its problems

All four added to frontmatter concepts and Further Reading section.

## Remaining Items

None. All critical and medium issues addressed. The article now:
- Engages major competitor interpretations (illusionism, decoherence objection)
- Provides clear falsification conditions
- Offers process philosophy as alternative framing
- Addresses the veto regress more thoroughly
- Cross-links to all relevant site content

## Metrics

- Critical issues addressed: 3
- Medium issues addressed: 5
- New sections added: 4 (Illusionist Response, Process Philosophy, Veto Regress, Decoherence Challenge, What Would Challenge This View?)
- Cross-links added: 4 (voluntary-attention, luck-objection, decoherence, illusionism)
- Word count increase: ~1,200 words (estimated)
