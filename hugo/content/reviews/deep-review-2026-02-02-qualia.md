title: Deep Review - Qualia
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Article**: [Qualia](/concepts/qualia/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-20](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-20-qualia/)
**Context**: Cross-review considering [emotional valence article](/topics/emotional-consciousness/)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Missing body-text cross-link to emotional-consciousness**: The article listed emotional-consciousness in frontmatter concepts but didn't cross-link in the body text despite valence being a paradigm case of qualia.
   - **Resolution**: Added cross-link in "Why Qualia Matter" section with pain asymbolia reference

2. **Valence not highlighted as paradigm case**: The emotional-consciousness article argues emotional valence provides the starkest case of irreducible qualia, but qualia.md didn't reflect this connection.
   - **Resolution**: Added sentence in "Why Qualia Matter" and brief note in "Intrinsic" subsection

### Counterarguments Considered

- **MWI self-locating uncertainty**: The No Many Worlds section could acknowledge self-locating uncertainty responses from MWI defenders. Deemed philosophical disagreement territory per previous review's stability notes—not flagged as requiring change.

- **Eliminativism**: The dismissal could be more substantive but was deemed adequate in previous review.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent four-property structure (intrinsic, private, ineffable, directly apprehensible)
- Strong thought experiment coverage (Mary's Room, Inverted Qualia, Zombies)
- Comprehensive tenet connections (all five addressed)
- Good falsifiability section with five specific conditions
- Front-loaded opening summary

### Enhancements Made
1. Cross-link to [emotional-consciousness](/topics/emotional-consciousness/) in "Why Qualia Matter" section
2. Pain asymbolia reference demonstrating valence's causal efficacy
3. Note on emotional valence as exemplifying intrinsicness
4. Added [emotional-consciousness](/topics/emotional-consciousness/) to related_articles frontmatter

### Cross-links Added
- [emotional-consciousness](/topics/emotional-consciousness/) — Valence as paradigm qualia, pain asymbolia evidence

## Remaining Items

None. This was a targeted cross-review; the article was already in good state from the 2026-01-20 deep review.

## Stability Notes

The article has now had two deep reviews:
- 2026-01-20: Major additions (Process Philosophy, falsifiability, expanded tenets, Dennett's heterophenomenology)
- 2026-02-02: Targeted cross-review connecting to emotional-consciousness article

The article appears stable. Philosophical disagreements (MWI, eliminativism) are bedrock—future reviews should NOT re-flag these as requiring substantive response. The six adversarial personas will always find the dualist position unsatisfying; that's expected, not a flaw.

Note: The Process Philosophy section added in the 2026-01-20 review appears to have been removed in an intervening edit (likely a condense operation). The Whitehead reference remains. This is not a critical loss—the section was supplementary.
