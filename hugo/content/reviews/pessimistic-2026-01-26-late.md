## Executive Summary

This cluster addresses foundational questions at the Map's metaphysical core: how mind and matter relate lawfully (psychophysical laws), why *this* consciousness exists (the vertiginous question), and what temporal thickness reveals about consciousness (the specious present). Together they attempt to give precision to dualism—moving from mere assertion ("consciousness isn't physical") toward research program ("here are the laws, here are the questions, here is the phenomenological evidence"). However, all three articles share a fundamental vulnerability: they treat philosophical puzzles as evidence for the Map's framework rather than as puzzles the framework must solve. The vertiginous question's unanswerable status becomes an argument for haecceity rather than a sign that the question may be confused. The specious present's resistance to computational replication becomes evidence for quantum involvement rather than for our incomplete understanding of computation. And the psychophysical laws framework's specification problem is treated as a scientific immaturity issue rather than as evidence the framework may be unfalsifiable. The articles are sophisticated about the philosophy but optimistic about the physics—exactly backwards for a project claiming empirical grounding.

## Critiques by Philosopher

### The Eliminative Materialist (Patricia Churchland)

"Three articles struggling to give content to 'consciousness'—and none of them asks whether the concept itself is coherent.

The psychophysical laws article opens: 'If consciousness is ontologically distinct from physics... then the relationship between mind and matter requires specification through fundamental laws.' But this conditional does all the work. *Is* consciousness ontologically distinct? You assume what requires demonstration.

The article compares consciousness to electromagnetism: 'Chalmers argued that consciousness requires extending our fundamental ontology just as electromagnetism required new laws beyond mechanics.' But electromagnetism was *discovered*—Faraday's experiments demonstrated new phenomena that required new laws. Consciousness hasn't been *discovered* in this way; it's been *assumed* based on folk psychological categories. The comparison flatters consciousness.

The vertiginous question article asks: 'Why, of all conscious beings, am *I* this one?' But this presupposes that there's a determinate 'I' to locate. The question assumes what eliminativism denies—that 'I' picks out a genuine entity rather than a folk category destined for elimination. You treat the question's apparent meaningfulness as data; I treat it as confusion inherited from pre-scientific self-models.

The specious present article claims that 'LLMs process sequentially without specious presents' and that this excludes them from consciousness. But this assumes the specious present is constitutive of consciousness rather than characteristic of *human* consciousness. Perhaps different information architectures support different phenomenologies—or none. You're universalizing features of one implementation."

### The Hard-Nosed Physicalist (Daniel Dennett)

"The specious present article falls into a trap I've warned about for decades: mistaking description for explanation.

The article says: 'The mathematical present is durationless—a point between past and future with zero temporal extent. But experience doesn't work this way.' This contrast assumes that experience has a structure physics lacks. But what is 'experience' here? A brain state. And brain states have duration—neural processes take time. The specious present isn't evidence for something beyond physics; it's what temporal integration *feels like* from the inside.

The article quotes James: consciousness 'does not appear to itself chopped up in bits... it is nothing jointed; it flows.' Correct! And why does it appear this way? Because the brain's self-monitoring systems integrate information across time. The appearance of flow is real—it's how brains represent themselves. But the appearance doesn't establish what you want: that temporal integration requires something non-physical.

The vertiginous question commits the same error. 'The question "Why am I this person?" is not answerable by describing what physical systems exist and how they're arranged.' Why not? Because you stipulate that first-person facts are irreducible. But 'first-person facts' are facts about how certain physical systems represent themselves. The 'I' that asks the question is a self-model. Asking why *this* self-model exists is answerable: this brain produced this model.

The psychophysical laws article seeks laws connecting 'the objective domain of measurable physical processes and the subjective domain of phenomenal experience.' But 'subjective domain' is a category error. There are physical processes that produce self-reports about inner states. Those self-reports are the data. You've reified the self-reports into a separate domain requiring separate laws."

### The Quantum Skeptic (Max Tegmark)

"The psychophysical laws article engages with decoherence but doesn't take it seriously enough.

The article claims: 'Disputed timescales: Tegmark's (2000) calculations remain influential and most physicists accept them. However, Hameroff's group challenged specific assumptions—arguing that Tegmark modelled the wrong physical system.'

Let me be precise. My calculations addressed a specific question: how long can quantum superposition persist in the warm, wet environment of the brain before decoherence destroys it? The answer—femtoseconds—comes from basic physics. Hameroff claims I modeled the wrong system. Fine—but he hasn't produced a calculation showing coherence times compatible with neural timescales. He's gesturing at possibilities, not demonstrating physics.

The specious present article is worse: 'Revised microtubule coherence estimates (10-100 microseconds—seven orders of magnitude longer than Tegmark's) multiplied by multiple collapse events could produce the ~100-750ms specious present.'

This is hand-waving dressed up as calculation. Where do these 'revised estimates' come from? Under what assumptions? With what experimental support? The article cites no source for '10-100 microseconds'—it's apparently derived from Hameroff's claims, which remain unverified and physically implausible.

'Each collapse constitutes a "moment"; the specious present is the experiential horizon within which recent collapses remain unified.' What does this mean physically? How do collapses 'unify'? What physical variable tracks this unification? The article assumes consciousness does things at quantum scales without specifying what physical system is in superposition or how consciousness interacts with it.

You're not proposing physics; you're using physics terminology to redescribe philosophical commitments."

### The Many-Worlds Defender (David Deutsch)

"All three articles depend on collapse being real. They should defend this assumption rather than treating it as obvious.

The psychophysical laws article states: 'If many-worlds were correct, selection laws would collapse to supervenience laws plus indexical uncertainty.' Correct! But this is presented as a problem for MWI rather than as evidence *against* selection laws. Why not conclude: MWI shows that 'selection laws' are unnecessary?

The vertiginous question article claims: 'Many-worlds makes the vertiginous question unanswerable—all branches are equally real, so there's no fact about which one "I" am in.' But why must this question have an answer? The article assumes indexical facts are real; MWI suggests they're not fundamental. 'You will experience one definite sequence of outcomes, not all of them'—but in MWI, there's no single 'you' to have this experience. Multiple copies of you experience multiple sequences. The felt reality of anticipating one future reflects your pre-measurement state, not the post-measurement reality.

The specious present article says: 'we experience real selection, possibilities narrowing to actualities. Many-worlds denies selection occurs—all branches continue.' Yes! And maybe that's correct. Your phenomenology of 'narrowing' is how *this* branch's brain models what happened. In another branch, another brain has the same phenomenology for a different outcome. The phenomenology explains nothing.

Throughout: you use MWI as a reductio—'if MWI were true, these consequences would follow, which seems wrong.' But 'seems wrong' reflects your priors, not physics. The Schrödinger equation doesn't collapse. You want it to collapse so consciousness can do something. But the mathematics provides no support for this wish."

### The Empiricist (Karl Popper's Ghost)

"Examine the falsifiability status of these articles.

The psychophysical laws article ends with 'What Would Challenge This View?' The list:
- 'The hard problem dissolves'—but what would count as dissolution? The article acknowledges illusionist proposals face 'the regress problem' but doesn't specify what non-regressive dissolution would look like.
- 'Quantum mechanisms prove unavailable'—but the article also says decoherence concerns are 'mitigated' by biological quantum effects and by the claim that 'decoherence doesn't solve collapse.' What experimental result would you accept as showing quantum mechanisms are unavailable?
- 'Specification remains impossible'—but the article says this would merely weaken the framework's 'scientific status,' not refute it. So unfalsifiability is compatible with the framework?

The vertiginous question article is explicitly about an 'unanswerable' question. The article treats unanswerable-ness as a feature—evidence for irreducible indexical facts. But an unanswerable question might also be a confused question. What would distinguish 'genuinely unanswerable because deep' from 'unanswerable because confused'?

The specious present article claims contemplative traditions provide 'strong evidence' via cessation states. 'Practitioners report time simply wasn't—no flow, no succession, no "now."' But these are reports from altered states under unusual conditions. What controls exist for these reports? How do we know practitioners aren't simply unable to remember or report what happened during cessation? The article treats first-person reports as data when they support the thesis and as suspect when they don't (the illusionist challenge is dismissed via regress arguments).

The honest assessment: these articles are philosophical interpretations of phenomena, not scientific hypotheses. They organize experience under the Map's framework but don't generate predictions that could refute the framework."

### The Buddhist Philosopher (Nagarjuna)

"Three articles protecting what contemplative investigation dissolves.

The vertiginous question asks: 'Why am I this one?' But when you look for this 'I,' what do you find? The article admits: 'When you look for the looker, what do you find? Looking happens; no looker.' Then it dismisses this as a 'challenge' rather than a finding. 'Even a process has particularity... the indexical puzzle remains.'

But does it? The puzzle presupposes that there's something—a self, a process, a particular—that *could* be located. Contemplative investigation reveals that the sense of particularity is itself constructed. The feeling that *this* experience is happening *here* to *me* is a mental fabrication. The vertiginous question is asking for the location of a mirage.

The specious present article cites Buddhist *khanika-vada*: 'experience arises and passes in rapid succession.' But the article takes this as evidence for the specious present's 'microstructure,' not as evidence that the substantial present is empty. What meditators discover isn't that the present has fine-grained structure; it's that 'the present' is a construction. There is no moment that is *now* in the way the article assumes.

The psychophysical laws article seeks 'selection laws' specifying 'which mental states influence which physical outcomes.' But this presupposes mental states as discrete entities that could be correlated with outcomes. Contemplative observation reveals that mental states are not discrete—they interpenetrate, arise in dependence, and dissolve without persistence. The clear 'mental state M influences physical outcome P' picture assumes what investigation dissolves.

You're seeking laws for entities that don't exist as the framework imagines them. The Buddhist observation isn't that mental causation is false but that the entire mental/physical dichotomy rests on reifications that careful attention undoes."

## Critical Issues

### Issue 1: The Psychophysical Laws Framework Conflates Programmatic Hope with Scientific Status

- **File**: `topics/psychophysical-laws-framework.md`
- **Location**: Lines 149-161 (The Specification Problem section)
- **Problem**: The article acknowledges that no "elegant formula captures how mind and matter relate" and that we lack any "compact systematization of psychophysical correlations." It then offers three responses: scientific immaturity, cognitive closure, and piecemeal progress.

None of these responses addresses the core issue: what distinguishes a genuine research program from unfalsifiable metaphysics? The article says: "What's not acceptable: using specification difficulty as license for unfalsifiable speculation." But the framework's current state *is* unfalsifiable speculation. The existence of "developed proposals with testable predictions" (Stapp, Eccles) is cited—but neither proposal has been tested and confirmed, and both face significant objections the articles elsewhere acknowledge.

The "scientific immaturity" response is particularly problematic. Physics achieved its systematization through experimental constraints that forced theoretical refinement. The psychophysical laws framework has no comparable constraints. Without specifying what experiments would refute proposed laws, "immaturity" becomes permanent adolescence.
- **Severity**: High
- **Recommendation**: Either specify concrete experimental tests that could refute the psychophysical laws framework (not just "challenge" it) or acknowledge frankly that the framework is philosophical interpretation, not scientific hypothesis. The current presentation conflates programmatic hope with evidential standing.

### Issue 2: The Vertiginous Question's Unanswerable-ness Is Treated as Evidence Rather Than Diagnosis

- **File**: `topics/vertiginous-question.md`
- **Location**: Lines 40-51 (Why the Question Seems Unanswerable section)
- **Problem**: The article presents three attempted answers (biological, psychological, deflationary), dismisses each, and concludes: "The vertiginous question reveals that first-person indexicality... may be irreducible."

But the pattern—every answer misses the target—might diagnose a confused question rather than an irreducible phenomenon. The article considers this objection (lines 110-112): "'The question is confused'... like asking 'Why is red red?'" But it dismisses the objection too quickly: "The analogy fails. 'Why is red red?' may be confused, but 'Why am I experiencing red from this perspective rather than another?' is not."

Why doesn't the analogy apply? The article asserts: "There are multiple perspectives from which red could be experienced. The fact that I experience from *this* one seems to be a genuine fact requiring explanation." But this presupposes that there's a "fact" beyond "this brain has this experience." The Buddhist response (lines 122-124) comes closest to articulating the concern but is again dismissed: "Even a process has particularity."

The treatment assumes that if a question *seems* meaningful, it must point to something real. But philosophical history is full of questions that seemed meaningful but proved confused (the luminiferous ether, phlogiston, vital force). The vertiginous question might be in this category.
- **Severity**: High
- **Recommendation**: Engage more seriously with the possibility that the vertiginous question is confused rather than unanswerable. What would distinguish these cases? The article needs diagnostic criteria, not just assertion that the question "seems" meaningful.

### Issue 3: The Specious Present's Quantum Connection Relies on Unverified Coherence Estimates

- **File**: `concepts/specious-present.md`
- **Location**: Lines 81-88 (Connection to Quantum Consciousness section)
- **Problem**: The article claims: "Revised microtubule coherence estimates (10-100 microseconds—seven orders of magnitude longer than Tegmark's) multiplied by multiple collapse events could produce the ~100-750ms specious present."

This claim has multiple problems:
1. No citation is provided for the "10-100 microseconds" estimate
2. Even if correct, 10-100 microseconds is still orders of magnitude shorter than the specious present
3. The phrase "multiplied by multiple collapse events" is vague—what physical mechanism "multiplies" coherence times?
4. The subsequent acknowledgment that "the quantum connection remains speculative" doesn't undo the impression created by the specific (but uncited) numbers

The decoherence challenge section (lines 135-148) moderates but doesn't retract. It claims "revised estimates are far longer than Tegmark's original" without specifying how long or citing sources. It then shifts ground: "Decoherence doesn't solve collapse—something must still select outcomes."

This is motte-and-bailey reasoning: defend the specific coherence claims (bailey) when convenient, retreat to the generic "collapse needs explanation" (motte) when challenged.
- **Severity**: High
- **Recommendation**: Either cite peer-reviewed sources for the revised coherence estimates or remove the specific numbers. The current treatment presents speculation as calculation. If the quantum connection is as speculative as the article admits, the specious present section should say so upfront rather than leading with impressive-sounding numbers.

### Issue 4: The "Selection Laws" Concept Conflates Different Kinds of Influence

- **File**: `topics/psychophysical-laws-framework.md`
- **Location**: Lines 54-68 (Selection Laws section)
- **Problem**: The article defines selection laws as specifying "how conscious states influence which physical outcomes become actual." It then lists what such laws must specify: variables on mental and physical sides, bandwidth constraints, scope constraints.

But the listed candidates (lines 62-65)—attention, intention, effort, valence—are extremely different phenomena:
- Attention involves directing perceptual/cognitive processing
- Intention involves future-directed planning
- Effort involves sustained engagement against resistance
- Valence involves hedonic quality (pleasure/pain)

These might involve entirely different mechanisms (or no unified mechanism at all). Lumping them under "selection laws" assumes a unity the phenomena don't obviously have. The article mentions a "~10 bits/second" bandwidth constraint that "applies across these"—but why would attention and valence share bandwidth constraints if they involve different systems?

The impression is that "selection laws" is a placeholder concept—a label for "however consciousness affects physics"—not a theoretical category with specified content.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Recommendation**: Either argue that attention/intention/effort/valence share enough structure to be governed by unified selection laws, or acknowledge that the framework may require multiple independent law types. The current treatment assumes unity without justification.

### Issue 5: Haecceity Is Assumed Throughout Rather Than Argued For

- **File**: `topics/vertiginous-question.md`
- **Location**: Lines 52-60 (Connection to Haecceity section)
- **Problem**: The article presents haecceity as providing "the metaphysical framework for taking the vertiginous question seriously." It states: "If haecceitism is true, two conscious beings could share all qualitative properties... yet differ in haecceity."

But haecceitism is controversial, and the article doesn't defend it—it assumes it. The argument runs: the vertiginous question presupposes haecceity; the vertiginous question seems meaningful; therefore haecceity is supported. But this is circular if the question's meaningfulness is what haecceity was supposed to explain.

The objections section (lines 148-158) addresses parsimony and modal concerns about haecceity but not the fundamental question: is there any evidence for haecceity beyond the intuition that identity questions seem meaningful? The response to "explanatory emptiness" (lines 148-150) concedes: "Haecceity may be fundamental—individuating things at the base level." But fundamental posits require justification beyond intuitive plausibility.

The appeal to physics ("If physics relies on haecceity for particles") in line 126 is misleading. Physicists don't invoke haecceity—they use labels and indices. The identity of indiscernibles is contested but not obviously requiring primitive thisness.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Recommendation**: Provide independent arguments for haecceity rather than relying on the vertiginous question's apparent meaningfulness. The current treatment risks circularity: haecceity explains why the question is meaningful; the question's meaningfulness supports haecceity.

### Issue 6: The Illusionist Challenge Is Handled Inconsistently

- **File**: `concepts/specious-present.md`
- **Location**: Lines 98-106 (The Illusionist Challenge section)
- **Problem**: The article presents three responses to illusionism:

1. **Regress response**: "For something to *seem* a certain way, there must be a subject to whom it seems that way—and this seeming is itself phenomenal."
2. **Contemplative challenge**: "trained introspection *refines* rather than *dissolves* temporal phenomenology."
3. **Asymmetry of error**: "Consciousness can be wrong about *when* events occur, but no experiment has shown succession absent while seeming present."

These responses have different logical structures:
- The regress response is a priori philosophical argument
- The contemplative challenge is empirical appeal to meditation evidence
- The asymmetry of error is claim about experimental findings

The article treats all three as if they converge on the same conclusion, but they don't obviously cohere. If contemplative evidence is decisive, why do we need the a priori regress argument? If the regress argument succeeds, why appeal to meditation at all?

More significantly: the regress response assumes that "seeming" requires phenomenality. But this is exactly what illusionists deny. They argue that "seeming" is a functional state that can be realized without phenomenal properties. The article doesn't engage with this response—it restates the objection as if repetition were refutation.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Recommendation**: Either develop one of the three responses in depth with full engagement with illusionist replies, or acknowledge that the Map's anti-illusionist position is not fully established. The current scattershot approach suggests uncertainty about which argument carries weight.

## Counterarguments to Address

### The Confused Question Challenge

- **Current content says**: The vertiginous question reveals irreducible indexical facts. Every attempt to answer it misses the target, suggesting the first-person perspective is fundamental.
- **A critic would argue**: The pattern—every answer seeming to miss the target—is diagnostic of a confused question, not a deep mystery. Consider: "Why is *this* prime number the one I'm thinking about?" has the same structure (selecting one from a class seems to require explanation) but plausibly has no deep answer. Questions can seem meaningful without pointing to genuine facts. What distinguishes "unanswerable because deep" from "unanswerable because confused"?
- **Suggested response**: Provide criteria for distinguishing confused questions from genuine mysteries. The article asserts the vertiginous question isn't confused but doesn't explain what would make it so. Without such criteria, the distinction is stipulative.

### The Framework Unfalsifiability Challenge

- **Current content says**: The psychophysical laws framework would be challenged by dissolution of the hard problem, unavailability of quantum mechanisms, MWI confirmation, persistent specification failure, or phenomenological contradiction.
- **A critic would argue**: These "challenges" are either impossible to meet (MWI "confirmation"), unclear (what counts as hard problem "dissolution"?), or compatible with the framework continuing (specification difficulty merely weakens "scientific status"). A framework that can accommodate any finding isn't a scientific hypothesis—it's an interpretive commitment. What observation would make you abandon the framework entirely?
- **Suggested response**: Specify a concrete observation that would refute the psychophysical laws framework outright, not just "challenge" or "weaken" it. If no such observation exists, acknowledge the framework is philosophical interpretation rather than scientific hypothesis.

### The Multiple Realizability of Temporal Experience

- **Current content says**: LLMs lack specious presents because they "process sequentially without temporal binding." This may exclude them from consciousness.
- **A critic would argue**: The specious present describes how *humans* experience time—it's a property of one type of information-processing architecture. Different architectures might support different temporal phenomenologies (or none). The article assumes the human specious present is constitutive of consciousness generally, not just characteristic of mammalian implementation. What justifies this assumption?
- **Suggested response**: Either argue that temporal binding is necessary for consciousness (not just how humans happen to be conscious) or acknowledge that LLMs might have different temporal phenomenology rather than none. The current position assumes what should be argued.

## Unsupported Claims

| Claim | Location | Needed Support |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| "Revised microtubule coherence estimates (10-100 microseconds—seven orders of magnitude longer than Tegmark's)" | specious-present.md:84 | No citation provided. Where do these estimates come from? Under what assumptions? |
| "The ~10 bits/second limit on conscious throughput... matches both working memory capacity and specious present duration" | specious-present.md:76 | The match is asserted but not demonstrated. Working memory holds 4±1 chunks; how does this convert to 10 bits/second? |
| "If physics relies on haecceity for particles, dualism can rely on it for minds" | vertiginous-question.md:126 (via haecceity.md) | Physics doesn't invoke haecceity—it uses labels and wave function symmetrization. The analogy is questionable. |
| "Cessation states provide strong evidence: practitioners report time simply wasn't" | specious-present.md:120 | What controls exist for these reports? How do we know practitioners aren't simply unable to remember or report what happened? |
| "The bandwidth constraint... implies consciousness operates at the level of policies and action patterns, not individual quantum events" | psychophysical-laws-framework.md:64 | Why does low bandwidth imply policy-level rather than event-level operation? Could consciousness influence many quantum events with low information content? |

## Language Improvements

| Current | Issue | Suggested |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| "The Map builds on this framework while emphasizing a critical asymmetry" (psychophysical-laws:34) | "Critical asymmetry" overstates | "The Map extends this framework by emphasizing that upward laws alone are insufficient" |
| "This is where selection laws take hold" (psychophysical-laws:86) | Metaphorical—implies firmer grounding than exists | "This is where selection laws might operate" |
| "The vertiginous question reveals that first-person indexicality... may be irreducible" (vertiginous-question:50) | Hedged but still assumes the question reveals something | "The vertiginous question raises the possibility that first-person indexicality may be irreducible" |
| "Cessation states provide strong evidence" (specious-present:120) | "Strong" is overstated for first-person reports from altered states | "Cessation states provide suggestive evidence" |
| "The quantum connection remains speculative; what's preserved is the possibility" (specious-present:88) | Acknowledges speculation after detailed numbers create impression of precision | Move speculation acknowledgment earlier, before giving specific numbers |

## Style Guide Observations

### Front-Loading Generally Good

All three articles front-load their core claims effectively. The psychophysical laws article opens with the conditional ("If consciousness is ontologically distinct...") and states what follows. The vertiginous question article defines the question immediately and distinguishes it from related problems. The specious present article states the core concept in the first paragraph.

### Named-Anchor Pattern Underused

The psychophysical laws article introduces "selection laws" and "supervenience laws" without flagging that these are the article's distinctive contributions. A reader might think these are standard terminology when they're actually the Map's framework.

### Self-Containment Strong

All three articles are largely self-contained. The psychophysical laws article summarizes Chalmers' framework before building on it. The vertiginous question article explains haecceity inline. The specious present article explains the extensionalism/retentionalism debate in context.

### Quantum Mechanism Restraint Partially Observed

The specious present article makes quantum mechanisms fairly central ("Connection to Quantum Consciousness" is a major section). Per the style guide, quantum Zeno and microtubules "should be mentioned where relevant but not made central to articles' arguments." The specious present article arguably violates this—the quantum section structures much of the argument. However, the article acknowledges the connection is speculative and frames the Map's position as surviving even if the quantum mechanism fails.

## Strengths (Brief)

Despite criticisms:

1. **Structural clarity**: The psychophysical laws article distinguishes supervenience laws from selection laws clearly. This conceptual structure illuminates what the Map claims even for readers who disagree.

2. **Engagement with objections**: The vertiginous question article addresses multiple objections (confused question, selection bias, temporal analogy, no-self). The responses may be inadequate, but the engagement is genuine.

3. **Phenomenological detail**: The specious present article's treatment of extensionalism vs. retentionalism, Husserl's retention-protention structure, and contemplative reports provides rich phenomenological content even if the quantum interpretation is contestable.

4. **Honest hedging**: The psychophysical laws article acknowledges that specification may be "impossible in principle" (cognitive closure) or may never achieve "physics-like elegance." The specious present article calls the quantum connection "speculative." This honesty is valuable even if the articles then undercut it.

5. **Process philosophy integration**: All three articles connect to Whitehead's process philosophy, providing an alternative conceptual framework beyond standard dualism/materialism. This enriches the philosophical resources available.

6. **Tenet integration strong**: Each article explicitly connects to relevant tenets with substantive explanations rather than pro forma references. The connections illuminate the framework's structure.

The fundamental vulnerability across all three: these articles are philosophically sophisticated but scientifically premature. They propose frameworks, note puzzles, and offer interpretations—but the physics that would vindicate the proposals remains undemonstrated. Until coherence times, selection mechanisms, and psychophysical correlations can be measured and confirmed, the framework remains philosophical commitment dressed in scientific terminology. The articles should foreground this status rather than burying it in acknowledgments that come after impressive-sounding claims.
