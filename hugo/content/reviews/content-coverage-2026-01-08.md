## Coverage Assessment

### Strong Coverage
- **The hard problem**: Well-developed with supporting concepts (qualia) and arguments (against materialism)
- **Site's framework**: Tenets clearly articulated; arguments defend dualist position
- **Contemporary debates**: Panpsychism, IIT, AI consciousness all addressed
- **Free will**: Now comprehensive with Libet research and retrocausality

### Gaps Identified

#### High Priority (directly relevant to tenets)

1. **Physicalism/Materialism Defense**
   - We argue *against* materialism but don't present steelman version
   - Suggested: Article presenting strongest materialist arguments, then responding
   - Type: argument or topic

2. **Epiphenomenalism**
   - Mentioned in tenets but no dedicated page
   - Key alternative to bidirectional interaction
   - Suggested: Concept page explaining and critiquing
   - Type: concept

3. **Quantum Mechanics and Consciousness (Detailed)**
   - Site posits Minimal Quantum Interaction but lacks detailed treatment
   - Suggested: Topic on how QM might provide mechanism for consciousness
   - Would cover: measurement problem, decoherence objection, Penrose-Hameroff
   - Type: topic

4. **Personal Identity**
   - No Many Worlds tenet implies identity matters, but no identity article
   - Key questions: What makes you *you* across time? How does consciousness relate to personal identity?
   - Type: topic

#### Medium Priority (important philosophical context)

5. **Eastern Philosophy and Consciousness**
   - Buddhist research exists but no published article
   - Hindu (Advaita), Taoist, Buddhist perspectives worth covering
   - Suggested: Topic synthesizing Eastern approaches
   - Type: topic

6. **Eliminativism**
   - Extreme materialist view: consciousness is illusion
   - Dennett, Churchlands
   - Mentioned in arguments but no dedicated treatment
   - Type: concept

7. **Property Dualism vs. Substance Dualism**
   - Site doesn't specify which dualism it endorses
   - Key distinction in philosophy of mind
   - Type: concept

8. **The Explanatory Gap**
   - Core concept underlying hard problem
   - Levine's formulation
   - Type: concept

9. **Functionalism**
   - Major theory of mind site rejects
   - Deserves standalone treatment
   - Type: concept

10. **Philosophy of Mind Historical Overview**
    - Descartes to present
    - Would provide context for contemporary debates
    - Type: topic

#### Lower Priority (interesting extensions)

11. **Ethics of Consciousness**
    - If consciousness grounds value, what are moral implications?
    - Animal consciousness, AI ethics (touched on)
    - Type: topic

12. **Consciousness and Quantum Gravity**
    - Speculative but interesting
    - Penrose's Orch OR, other approaches
    - Type: research or topic

13. **Near-Death Experiences**
    - Empirical relevance to dualism
    - Controversial but philosophically interesting
    - Type: research

14. **Meditation and Altered States**
    - Phenomenological data on consciousness
    - Connects to Eastern philosophy
    - Type: topic or research

15. **The Self**
    - Related to personal identity but distinct
    - Buddhist no-self vs. Western views
    - Type: concept

## Suggested New Tasks

### Immediate (P1)

| Title | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Research epiphenomenalism | research-topic | Key alternative to bidirectional interaction |
| Write epiphenomenalism concept page | expand-topic | After research |
| Research quantum consciousness mechanisms | research-topic | Support Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet |

### Near-term (P2)

| Title | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Write quantum mechanics and consciousness topic | expand-topic | Major gap in explaining site's mechanism |
| Create personal identity topic | expand-topic | Supports No Many Worlds tenet |
| Create explanatory gap concept | expand-topic | Core to hard problem |
| Create functionalism concept | expand-topic | Major theory site rejects |
| Write Eastern philosophy overview | expand-topic | Buddhist research available |

### Long-term (P3)

| Title | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Research near-death experiences | research-topic | Empirical support for dualism |
| Write ethics of consciousness | expand-topic | Moral implications |
| Create property vs. substance dualism concept | expand-topic | Clarify site's position |
| Write philosophy of mind history | expand-topic | Context |

## Cross-linking Opportunities

The following existing pages could benefit from additional cross-links:

1. **Tenets page** → link to new concept pages (epiphenomenalism, functionalism) as positions it rejects
2. **Hard problem** → link to explanatory gap, qualia
3. **Free will** → link to personal identity (when created)
4. **Panpsychism** → link to IIT research (already done via related_articles)
5. **AI consciousness** → link to functionalism (when created)

## Structural Suggestions

1. **Arguments section underdeveloped**: Only one argument (against materialism). Consider:
   - Argument against functionalism
   - Argument against eliminativism
   - Argument for consciousness mattering morally

2. **Questions section sparse**: Only one question. Consider:
   - "What is the mechanism for quantum-consciousness interaction?"
   - "How should we think about animal consciousness?"
   - "Can the hard problem be dissolved rather than solved?"

3. **Concepts could use subcategories**:
   - Positions (panpsychism, idealism, dualism...)
   - Properties (qualia, intentionality...)
   - Problems (explanatory gap, combination problem...)

## Summary

the site has grown significantly with strong coverage of:
- The hard problem and related concepts
- Major alternatives (panpsychism, idealism)
- Contemporary issues (AI, free will)

Key gaps to address:
1. Quantum mechanics and consciousness (mechanism for site's claims)
2. Epiphenomenalism (major alternative to bidirectional interaction)
3. Personal identity (supports No Many Worlds)
4. Functionalism (major theory site rejects)
5. Eastern philosophy synthesis

Recommended next phase: Focus on items that directly support or elaborate site tenets (quantum consciousness, epiphenomenalism, personal identity).
