# Deep Review: Minimal Consciousness

**Date**: 2026-01-20
**File**: obsidian/concepts/minimal-consciousness.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None

### Medium Issues Found
- Missing illusionism engagement: Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section engaging Dennett/Frankish with scaling argument (illusion problem requires meta-representational machinery unlikely in 302-neuron systems) and Tallis's regress objection.
- Missing process philosophy perspective: Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section presenting Whitehead's actual occasions as alternative framing for minimal consciousness (degrees of integration rather than presence/absence threshold).
- Missing falsifiability section: Added "What Would Challenge This View?" with five specific conditions that would undermine The Unfinishable Map's perspective.
- No Many Worlds tenet not addressed: Added No Many Worlds section to Relation to Site Perspective explaining how MWI dissolves rather than addresses the minimal consciousness question.
- Missing cross-links: Added illusionism.md, mysterianism.md, introspection.md, decoherence.md to frontmatter and Further Reading.

### Counterarguments Considered
- Illusionist response: Addressed through scaling challenge—if consciousness is an illusion, the illusion-generating machinery must exist somewhere, and 302 neurons seems implausible for generating sophisticated introspective misrepresentations.
- Mysterian perspective: Integrated cognitive closure as complementary interpretation—C. elegans case exemplifies complete structural knowledge without bridging explanatory gap.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Core framing that hard problem applies equally at all levels of complexity
- UAL framework presentation and careful distinction between marker and mechanism
- Slime mold puzzle as clarifying cognition-consciousness distinction
- Bidirectional Interaction argument linking UAL to adaptive value

### Enhancements Made
- Expanded decoherence engagement in slime mold section—classical biochemical mechanisms may explain sophisticated cognition without phenomenal experience
- Added mysterian angle to the *C. elegans* complete-knowledge paradox
- Added process philosophy alternative to sharp threshold models
- Strengthened No Many Worlds connection showing how MWI dissolves determinate facts about particular organisms

### Cross-links Added
- [illusionism](/concepts/illusionism/) (frontmatter and Further Reading)
- [mysterianism](/concepts/mysterianism/) (frontmatter and Further Reading)
- [introspection](/concepts/introspection/) (frontmatter and Further Reading)
