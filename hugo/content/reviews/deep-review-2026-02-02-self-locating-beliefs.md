title: Deep Review - Self-Locating Beliefs
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Article**: [Self-Locating Beliefs](/concepts/self-locating-beliefs/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None identified. The article is philosophically careful and already distinguishes epistemic from metaphysical claims appropriately (reflecting prior refinement work).

### Medium Issues Found
1. **MWI engagement could be stronger**: The article stated MWI "cannot ground" self-locating beliefs without acknowledging that Everettians have developed responses. **Resolution**: Added reference to Wallace, Saunders, and Sebens/Carroll accounts while explaining why the Map finds them unsatisfying.

2. **Functionalist response unacknowledged**: The claim that "you will experience one definite sequence" treats felt definiteness as unproblematic. **Resolution**: Added acknowledgment that functionalists might view felt definiteness as constructed, with response explaining why this doesn't dissolve the problem.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Dennett-style heterophenomenology**: Felt definiteness might be a narrative construction. Added acknowledgment with response.
- **MWI accounts of self-locating uncertainty**: Added citation of major contributors (Wallace, Saunders, Sebens/Carroll) while maintaining the Map's critique.
- **Epistemic vs metaphysical gap**: Already well-addressed in prior refinement; the three independent arguments remain.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear distinction between epistemic thesis (indexical knowledge is cognitively irreducible) and metaphysical thesis (indexical facts are ontologically real)
- Three independent arguments for the metaphysical thesis: explanatory gap, phenomenological, counterfactual
- Concrete examples grounding abstract arguments (Perry's supermarket, Lewis's Two Gods, Sleeping Beauty)
- Framework mismatch argument against MWI self-locating uncertainty
- Honest acknowledgment of what arguments establish and their limitations
- Substantive "Relation to Site Perspective" section connecting to all relevant tenets

### Enhancements Made
1. Added acknowledgment of Everettian accounts of self-locating uncertainty (Wallace, Saunders, Sebens/Carroll)
2. Added functionalist response to "felt definiteness" with counter-response
3. Added cross-link to [indexical-identity-quantum-measurement](/topics/indexical-identity-quantum-measurement/)
4. Removed outdated AI refinement log comment

### Cross-links Added
- [indexical-identity-quantum-measurement](/topics/indexical-identity-quantum-measurement/) (in MWI section)

## Remaining Items

None. The article is philosophically sound and already underwent significant refinement on 2026-02-02 addressing the epistemic/metaphysical distinction.

## Stability Notes

This article has reached a stable state. Key philosophical disagreements that will persist:

- **MWI proponents** will continue to find the anti-branching arguments question-begging, since they reject the premise that there must be a fact about "which branch you're in." This is a framework clash, not a fixable flaw.
- **Eliminative materialists** will reject the metaphysical thesis and view the three supporting arguments as circular. The article acknowledges these are "prima facie reasons" rather than proofs—this is appropriate epistemic humility, not a weakness.
- **Buddhist philosophers** will deny the self that indexical facts are supposed to be about. This is engaged in the related [indexical-facts](/concepts/indexical-facts/) article and need not be duplicated here.

Future reviews should NOT re-flag these as critical issues—they represent bedrock philosophical disagreements that the Map explicitly sides with against mainstream physicalism.
