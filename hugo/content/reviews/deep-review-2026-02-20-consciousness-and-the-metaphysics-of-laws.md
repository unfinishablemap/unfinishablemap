title: Deep Review - Consciousness and the Metaphysics of Laws
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-20
**Article**: [Consciousness and the Metaphysics of Laws](/topics/consciousness-and-the-metaphysics-of-laws/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **No Many Worlds tenet omitted from Relation to Site Perspective**: The article assumed single-outcome collapse throughout (consciousness "selects," "biases quantum outcomes") but did not connect to the No Many Worlds tenet. Added a full paragraph explaining why the Map's rejection of MWI makes the metaphysics of laws question urgent. Resolution: Added No Many Worlds subsection to Relation to Site Perspective.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Asymmetric explanatory standard for Humeanism**: Article claimed Humean psychophysical laws lack "explanatory depth" without acknowledging Humean physical laws face the same charge. Resolution: Added explicit engagement with the Humean symmetry objection, with a dualist response distinguishing intra-domain from cross-domain explanatory gaps.
- **Zombie-charge disanalogy**: The conditional necessity resolution used charge as an analogy, but charge is a physical property (its absence changes the physical world) while consciousness is non-physical (zombies are physically identical). Resolution: Added a paragraph explicitly acknowledging the disanalogy and its implications.
- **Chalmers attribution softened**: Original text attributed to Chalmers a specific demand that psychophysical laws explain "why" correlations hold. In *The Conscious Mind*, Chalmers tends to treat psychophysical laws as brute fundamental laws rather than demanding deeper explanation. Resolution: Reframed as the hard problem transplanted into the metaphysics of laws, without over-attributing to Chalmers.
- **Lewis citation incomplete**: Added Lewis (1994) "Humean Supervenience Debugged" as the primary reference for the best-system analysis, alongside the original Lewis (1973).
- **Missing cross-links**: Added wikilinks to [hard-problem-of-consciousness](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/), [mental-causation](/concepts/mental-causation/), [philosophical-zombies](/concepts/philosophical-zombies/), [epiphenomenalism](/concepts/epiphenomenalism/), [quantum-consciousness](/concepts/quantum-consciousness/), [emergence](/concepts/emergence/), [selection-laws](/concepts/selection-laws/), [consciousness-and-causal-powers](/topics/consciousness-and-causal-powers/).

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Humean symmetry objection** (if brute regularity suffices for physical laws, why not for psychophysical?): Addressed with the argument that cross-domain regularities bridging ontologically distinct categories create a qualitatively different explanatory gap than intra-domain physical regularities.
- **Eliminativist objection** (no phenomenal properties to write laws about): Not addressed directly, as dualism is a tenet. The article legitimately takes the existence of phenomenal properties as a starting point.
- **Decoherence objection** to quantum biasing: Not addressed in this article, as it is covered extensively in the tenets page and psychophysical-laws concept article. The article's scope is the metaphysics of laws, not quantum mechanics.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Tripartite structure evaluating all three accounts of laws (rare in the literature)
- Conditional necessity resolution for the zombie/dispositional tension
- Humean collapse observation (committed Humean collapses back into physicalism)
- The "legislation problem" as a named concept
- Progressive depth structure (Humean → governing → dispositional)
- Honest cost accounting for each view
- Structural parallelism across sections

### Enhancements Made
- **Quantum measurement problem connection**: Added paragraph in governing laws section showing how a psychophysical governing law could complete quantum mechanics by prescribing outcomes where physics leaves them undetermined. Connected to the Map's selection law framework.
- **Mysterian normalisation point**: Added paragraph in "Why This Matters" section noting that none of the three accounts fully explains even purely physical laws, which normalises the difficulty of psychophysical laws as a general metaphysical challenge rather than a special indictment of dualism.
- **Charge disanalogy acknowledgment**: Added paragraph strengthening intellectual honesty about the limits of the charge/consciousness parallel.

## Remaining Items

None. All critical and medium issues have been addressed.

## Stability Notes

- Eliminativists will always challenge the premise that phenomenal properties exist. This is a bedrock disagreement grounded in the Map's dualism tenet, not a fixable flaw.
- The decoherence objection to quantum biasing is a legitimate physics challenge but is out of scope for this article on the metaphysics of laws. It is addressed in other Map articles.
- The Humean symmetry objection (brute regularity is equally shallow for physical and psychophysical laws) represents a genuine philosophical standoff. The article now engages it explicitly; future reviews should not re-flag it as unaddressed.
