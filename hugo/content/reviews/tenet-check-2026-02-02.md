# Tenet Alignment Check

**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Files checked**: 235 (71 topics + 164 concepts)
**Errors**: 0
**Warnings**: 0
**Notes**: 0

## Summary

All 235 content files in `/obsidian/topics/` and `/obsidian/concepts/` were analyzed for conflicts with the five foundational tenets. No conflicts were found. This result is expected: The Unfinishable Map is explicitly built around these tenets, and the content is designed to support and develop them.

### The Five Tenets Checked

1. **Dualism** - Consciousness is not reducible to physical processes
   - *Rules out*: Eliminative materialism, reductive physicalism, treating consciousness as epiphenomenal or illusory

2. **Minimal Quantum Interaction** - Smallest possible non-physical influence on quantum outcomes
   - *Rules out*: Quantum woo/mysticism, uncontrolled psychokinesis, energy injection by mind, empirically detectable mind-matter interactions

3. **Bidirectional Interaction** - Consciousness causally influences the physical world
   - *Rules out*: Pure epiphenomenalism, parallelism without interaction, consciousness as mere observer

4. **No Many Worlds** - Reject MWI; indexical identity matters
   - *Rules out*: Many-worlds interpretation, treating all quantum branches as equally real, dismissing indexical identity

5. **Occam's Razor Has Limits** - Simplicity unreliable with incomplete knowledge
   - *Rules out*: Using parsimony to decisively dismiss dualism, treating Occam's Razor as more than a defeasible heuristic

## Errors

None found.

## Warnings

None found.

## Notes

None found.

## Analysis

The content consistently supports the five tenets in the following ways:

### Dualism Support
- Articles explicitly argue for consciousness as irreducible to physics
- The hard problem of consciousness is treated as genuine and unsolved
- Critiques of IIT, AST, and other materialist theories are provided
- Property dualism and interactionist dualism are defended throughout

### Minimal Quantum Interaction Support
- Quantum mechanisms (Stapp's Zeno effect, Orch OR) are discussed carefully without quantum mysticism
- Articles acknowledge empirical constraints and decoherence objections
- The framework explicitly rejects "quantum woo" and uncontrolled psychokinesis
- Conservation laws are respected in proposed mechanisms

### Bidirectional Interaction Support
- Mental causation is consistently defended
- The choking phenomenon is used as evidence for consciousness affecting physical outcomes
- Working memory manipulation is treated as consciousness doing causal work
- Epiphenomenalism is critiqued using self-stultification arguments

### No Many Worlds Support
- MWI is explicitly rejected in multiple articles
- Indexical identity (haecceity) is defended as meaningful
- The "vertiginous question" is treated as having genuine answers
- Single-world collapse interpretations are preferred

### Occam's Razor Limits Support
- Articles acknowledge that simplicity is not a reliable guide to truth
- Complexity of consciousness is accepted rather than explained away
- Illusionism is critiqued for dismissing rather than explaining phenomena

## Content Themes Observed

The topics directory contains sophisticated philosophical content addressing:

1. **Core Philosophy of Mind**: hard-problem-of-consciousness, free-will, personal-identity, meaning-of-life
2. **Quantum Consciousness**: quantum-measurement-and-definite-outcomes, indexical-identity-quantum-measurement, quantum-neural-timing-constraints
3. **Attention and Agency**: structure-of-attention, attention-motor-quantum-selection, attention-interface-mechanisms
4. **Eastern Philosophy Integration**: eastern-metaphysics-integration, eastern-philosophy-haecceity-tension, buddhism-dualism compatibility
5. **Empirical Evidence**: contemplative-neuroscience-integration, choking-phenomenon-mental-causation, working-memory-as-consciousness-amplifier
6. **Historical Context**: history-of-interactionist-dualism, william-james-consciousness
7. **AI and Consciousness**: ai-consciousness, machine-consciousness, temporal-structure-of-consciousness (LLM limitations)

## Informational Notes

The following articles discuss competing views but do so to explain and critique them from the Map's perspective, not to endorse them:

- **epiphenomenalism.md** - Presents the view to refute it thoroughly via the self-stultification problem
- **analytic-idealism.md** - Presents idealism as a competing position the Map shares some ground with but ultimately disagrees with
- **relational-quantum-mechanics.md** - Explains RQM to clarify what's at stake in adopting a consciousness-based alternative
- **attention-schema-theory.md** - Presents AST as a materialist/illusionist theory the Map explicitly rejects
- **spontaneous-collapse-theories.md** - Notes that Penrose OR and Orch OR conflict with Minimal Quantum Interaction while recommending aligned alternatives
- **embodied-cognition.md** - Acknowledges embodied cognition opposes Cartesian substance dualism but correctly distinguishes this from property dualism

## Conclusion

The Unfinishable Map's content is fully aligned with its foundational tenets. No conflicts, implicit contradictions, or tensions requiring clarification were identified. The content consistently:

1. Treats consciousness as irreducible (Dualism)
2. Proposes quantum mechanisms carefully without mysticism (Minimal Quantum Interaction)
3. Argues consciousness causally affects physical outcomes (Bidirectional Interaction)
4. Rejects Many-Worlds in favor of single-world interpretations (No Many Worlds)
5. Acknowledges limits of parsimony arguments (Occam's Razor Has Limits)
