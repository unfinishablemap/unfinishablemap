title: Deep Review - Mental Causation
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-01-29
**Article**: [Mental Causation](/concepts/mental-causation/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-26](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-26-mental-causation/)
**Word count**: 2908 → 2931 (+23, length-neutral)
**Context**: Cross-review considering delegatory-dualism.md

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article was already at stability from the 2026-01-26 review.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing reference to delegatory dualism**: The "Major Responses" section covered interventionism, inheritance/constitution, strong emergence, and quantum opening—but not Saad's 2025 delegatory dualism framework, which directly addresses the exclusion problem the article is about. [RESOLVED: Added Delegatory Dualism subsection in Major Responses]

### Counterarguments Considered
All six adversarial personas engaged:
- Eliminative materialist: No new concerns beyond existing illusionism section
- Hard-nosed physicalist: Incomplete coverage of responses to Kim—now addressed with delegatory dualism
- Quantum skeptic: Decoherence section adequate (per previous review)
- MWI defender: Philosophical standoff remains (stability note from previous review)
- Empiricist: Falsifiability section strong
- Buddhist philosopher: No specific concerns

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Self-stultification argument: Clear, epistemically powerful
- Kim's exclusion argument presentation: Fair and comprehensive
- Quantum opening explanation: Accessible without oversimplifying
- Agent causation section: Good phenomenological grounding
- Falsifiability conditions: Demonstrates epistemic humility
- Process philosophy alternative: Good complementary framing

### Enhancements Made
- Added "Delegatory Dualism" subsection explaining Saad's preemption strategy
- Connected Saad's observational/universal closure distinction to Map's quantum framework
- Added [delegatory-dualism](/topics/delegatory-dualism/) to concepts frontmatter
- Added delegatory-dualism to Further Reading
- Added Saad (2025) to References
- Tightened Overdetermination, Interventionism, and Inheritance sections to maintain length neutrality

### Cross-links Added
- [delegatory-dualism](/topics/delegatory-dualism/) (concepts frontmatter, Major Responses section, Further Reading)

## Remaining Items

None. The cross-review integration with delegatory dualism is complete.

## Stability Notes

This is the third deep review. The article has reached stability:

- **The MWI objection** remains a philosophical standoff—Many-Worlds defenders will find the indexical argument unsatisfying. Bedrock disagreement, not a flaw.

- **The decoherence objection** is acknowledged as genuinely challenging while noting it doesn't solve the measurement problem. Future physics research may strengthen or weaken the quantum opening.

- **The illusionist challenge** is engaged adequately. The regress problem is a standard response; this is ongoing philosophical debate.

- **The specification problem** is properly connected to the psychophysical-laws-framework. This remains the main area for future development as mechanism proposals develop.

- **Delegatory dualism** now integrated. Saad's framework complements the quantum mechanism by addressing causal structure. The article now presents both the "how" (quantum) and "why not overdetermination" (delegation) aspects of mental causation.

The article is at 117% of soft threshold (2931 words). Further expansion is not warranted; future reviews should focus on accuracy and connection maintenance.
