title: Deep Review - Conservation Laws and Mind-Brain Causation
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-05
**Article**: [Conservation Laws and Mind-Brain Causation](/topics/conservation-laws-and-mind/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-29](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-29-conservation-laws-and-mind/)

## Review Context

This third review was triggered with specific context: evaluate the article in light of the newly published [brain-specialness-boundary](/topics/brain-specialness-boundary/) and [brain-interface-boundary](/concepts/brain-interface-boundary/) articles, which address the "Why Not Psychokinesis?" objection. The conservation article's "selection not injection" framework naturally raises the question of scope—if consciousness can select among quantum outcomes, why only in brains?—and the brain-specialness work provides the answer.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Six adversarial philosopher personas examined the article:

### Critical Issues Found

None. The article's core arguments remain sound through three reviews. The Cucu-Pitts arguments are accurately attributed, Carroll is fairly represented, Stapp's orthodox QM credentials are correctly noted, and all factual claims have references.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Missing cross-link to brain-specialness-boundary**: The article discussed consciousness acting "on neurons in a particular brain" and the selection framework operating at quantum indeterminacies—but never addressed *why only brains*. The brain-specialness-boundary article directly extends this argument.
   - *Resolution*: Added paragraph in "Consciousness as Selector" section noting brain-locality of the mechanism and linking to brain-specialness-boundary.

2. **Missing brain-locality dimension in "Relation to Site Perspective"**: The Minimal Quantum Interaction discussion noted energy minimality but not scope minimality—a dimension the brain-specialness work makes explicit.
   - *Resolution*: Added note that "minimal" applies in two dimensions: energy (none) and scope (own brain only).

3. **Missing cross-links to related content**: The article lacked connections to brain-interface-boundary (positive criteria for consciousness interfaces) and mental-causation (broader philosophical framework).
   - *Resolution*: Added three entries to Further Reading and two to frontmatter related_articles.

### Attribution Accuracy Check

All checks passed:
- Cucu and Pitts: accurately attributed, correctly characterized
- Carroll: accurately quoted from Scientific American blog post
- Stapp: correctly described as using orthodox QM (von Neumann-Lüders)
- Tegmark and Hagan: correctly cited with dispute acknowledged
- No source/Map conflation detected
- No dropped qualifiers detected
- No self-contradictions found

### Counterarguments Considered

All major counterarguments from previous reviews remain well-addressed:
- MWI eliminates need for collapse: addressed with indexical objection
- Tegmark's decoherence calculations: addressed with Hagan et al. response
- Unfalsifiability: honestly acknowledged with epistemic humility
- "Any selection mechanism would be detectable": fairly engaged

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

Six sympathetic philosopher personas identified strengths:

### Strengths Preserved

- **Opening summary**: Excellent front-loading of the key argument—conservation objection rests on misunderstandings
- **Five-step argument structure**: Clear statement of the conservation objection then systematic refutation
- **"Selection not injection" framework**: The article's distinctive and central contribution
- **Question-begging diagnosis**: The Cucu-Pitts argument that the conservation objection *assumes* no external influences is devastating
- **Epistemic humility**: Consistent distinction between compatibility and proof
- **Balanced objection handling**: All major objections treated fairly

### Enhancements Made

1. **Brain-locality paragraph**: Added in "Consciousness as Selector" section, noting that selection operates only within neural systems integrated into the subject's control loop, with cross-link to brain-specialness-boundary for the full argument.

2. **Dual minimality**: Enhanced "Relation to Site Perspective" to note that "minimal" in the Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet applies in two dimensions—energy and scope—connecting to brain-specialness-boundary.

3. **Cross-links added**:
   - [brain-specialness-boundary](/topics/brain-specialness-boundary/) (Further Reading + related_articles)
   - [brain-interface-boundary](/concepts/brain-interface-boundary/) (Further Reading)
   - [mental-causation](/concepts/mental-causation/) (Further Reading + related_articles)

## Remaining Items

None. The article has now been through three deep reviews and is stable. The brain-specialness context has been integrated through cross-links and brief contextual notes without disrupting the article's focused argument about conservation laws.

## Stability Notes

This article has fully converged. The core argument is sound and well-structured:

1. Conservation is local and conditional (Pitts)
2. The conservation objection begs the question (Cucu and Pitts)
3. Selection without injection is compatible with conservation (framework)
4. The selection mechanism is brain-local (now connected to brain-specialness-boundary)

**Bedrock disagreements** (not fixable, not critical):
- Eliminative materialists will always demand positive evidence of neural deviations—this is a methodological impasse
- MWI defenders will find the indexical objection unconvincing—this is a bedrock disagreement about meaningful questions
- Empiricists remain uncomfortable with unfalsifiability—the article honestly acknowledges this
- Buddhist philosophers note the assumption of a substantial self—a fundamental philosophical difference

Future reviews should NOT re-flag these as critical issues. The article accomplishes its goal: showing conservation laws don't rule out mental causation.
