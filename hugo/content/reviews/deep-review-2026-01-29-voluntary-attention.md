title: Deep Review - Voluntary Attention
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-01-29
**Article**: [Voluntary Attention](/voluntary-attention/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-24](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-24-voluntary-attention/)
**Cross-review context**: attention-motor-quantum-interface.md

## Context

This is a cross-review considering voluntary-attention.md in light of the newly created attention-motor-quantum-interface.md article. The goal is to ensure consistency and strengthen connections between the articles.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article is well-structured and accurate.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Missing Desmurget et al. (2009) citation**: The Desmurget double dissociation finding was mentioned without formal citation in the References section.
   - **Resolution**: Added inline citation and full reference.

2. **Premotor theory of attention not attributed to Rizzolatti**: The new attention-motor-quantum-interface.md properly attributes PMTA to Giacomo Rizzolatti, but voluntary-attention.md did not.
   - **Resolution**: Added "Giacomo Rizzolatti's" attribution.

3. **Thura & Cisek (2014) not cited**: The ~280ms motor commitment timing was mentioned without source.
   - **Resolution**: Added inline citation and full reference.

### Low Issues Found

1. Minor timing notation: "~300ms" for attention vs "~280ms" for motor—acceptable difference showing these are essentially the same window, not contradictory figures.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Eliminative Materialist**: Additional neural activity during willed attention could be more complex neural processing, not non-physical causation. The article appropriately acknowledges this by noting findings "don't prove consciousness is non-physical."

- **Quantum Skeptic**: Decoherence challenge remains significant but is handled honestly. Previous review strengthened this section; no further changes needed.

- **MWI Defender**: This remains a bedrock philosophical disagreement. Previous review noted it could engage more with Saunders/Wallace but the core argument is sound.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Phenomenological descriptions ("being pulled" vs "directing") are vivid and accurate
- The willed/instructed/exogenous three-level distinction is philosophically significant
- Neural signatures table provides empirical traction
- "What Would Challenge This View?" section provides excellent falsifiability conditions
- Contemplative Evidence section's nuanced treatment of Buddhist phenomenology
- Existing connection to attention-motor-quantum-interface.md in frontmatter and Further Reading

### Enhancements Made

1. Added Rizzolatti attribution for PMTA: "Giacomo Rizzolatti's [premotor theory of attention](/attention-motor-quantum-interface/) (PMTA)"
2. Added Thura & Cisek (2014) inline citation for motor commitment timing
3. Added Desmurget et al. (2009) inline citation
4. Added two new references to References section (Desmurget et al. 2009, Thura & Cisek 2014)

### Cross-links Verified

- [attention-motor-quantum-interface](/attention-motor-quantum-interface/) already in frontmatter concepts and Further Reading
- Inline link to PMTA in body text with proper attribution

## Word Count

Before: 2231 words (89% of 2500 soft threshold)
After: ~2250 words (90% of 2500 soft threshold)
Change: +19 words (minor additions for citations and attribution)

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues were addressed.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed twice (2026-01-24 and 2026-01-29). Both reviews found no critical issues. The article appears stable with:

- Sound structure and argumentation
- Accurate citations
- Good connection to related content (attention-motor-quantum-interface.md, quantum-neural-timing-constraints.md)
- Honest treatment of counterarguments

Future reviews should not re-flag the MWI section as problematic—this represents a bedrock philosophical disagreement between single-world and many-worlds interpretations, not a fixable flaw.

The article now has proper attribution for both Rizzolatti (PMTA) and the key empirical findings (Desmurget double dissociation, Thura & Cisek motor commitment timing), strengthening its scholarly grounding.
