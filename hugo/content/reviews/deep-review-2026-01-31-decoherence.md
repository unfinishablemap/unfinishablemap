# Deep Review: Decoherence and Quantum Biology

**Date**: 2026-01-31
**File**: obsidian/concepts/decoherence.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-20

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article was already well-structured from the previous review.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Fisher coherence time imprecision**: Original text said "~10⁵ seconds—hours, not microseconds" which was vague.
   - **Resolution**: Changed to "~10⁵ seconds (~28 hours)" for precision.

2. **MWI falsifiability framing**: Original text said "if the Many-Worlds interpretation were empirically confirmed" which is philosophically problematic since MWI and Copenhagen are empirically equivalent.
   - **Resolution**: Reframed to "becomes the consensus interpretation" with acknowledgment of empirical equivalence.

### Low Issues Found
1. Illusionist section could engage more deeply with heterophenomenology—but this was already addressed in the 2026-01-20 review. Article has reached stability on this point.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist dismissal**: Expected given tenets; not a flaw.
- **Quantum skeptic challenge**: Article handles Tegmark fairly and acknowledges uncertainty.
- **MWI defense**: Article acknowledges this as a genuine falsification condition.
- **Buddhist non-substantialism**: Incompatible with the Map's dualist framework by design.

### Attribution Accuracy Check
All attributions verified:
- Tegmark (2000): 10⁻¹³ seconds coherence time ✓
- Hagan et al. (2002): Seven orders of magnitude increase ✓
- Fleming (2007): FMO complex, correctly revised in prior review ✓
- Fisher (2015): Posner molecules ✓
- Tallis (2024): "Misrepresentation presupposes presentation" ✓
- Stapp (2007): Quantum Zeno ✓
- Whitehead (1929): Actual occasions ✓

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent opening paragraph front-loading key claims (LLM-friendly)
- Clear "What Decoherence Does / Does Not Do" pedagogical structure
- Balanced Tegmark-Hameroff debate presentation
- Accurate photosynthesis section (revised in prior review)
- Five falsifiability conditions showing epistemic humility
- Illusionist and Process Philosophy sections from prior review
- Three-part response in "Relation to Site Perspective"

### Enhancements Made
1. Fisher coherence time precision: Added explicit conversion (~28 hours)
2. MWI falsifiability precision: Acknowledged empirical equivalence
3. Added cross-link to [process-philosophy](/concepts/process-philosophy/) concept
4. Added [process-philosophy](/concepts/process-philosophy/) and [phenomenal-consciousness](/concepts/phenomenal-consciousness/) to frontmatter concepts

### Cross-links Added
- [process-philosophy](/concepts/process-philosophy/) — inline link in Process Philosophy section
- Added to concepts frontmatter: [process-philosophy](/concepts/process-philosophy/), [phenomenal-consciousness](/concepts/phenomenal-consciousness/)

## Remaining Items

None. The article is stable and well-developed.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed twice (2026-01-20 and 2026-01-31). Key observations:

1. **No critical issues found in this review**—the previous review addressed the major gaps (illusionist section, falsifiability, process philosophy, photosynthesis accuracy).

2. **Philosophical disagreements are bedrock, not fixable**: Eliminative materialists and MWI defenders will always find the article unsatisfying—this reflects the Map's dualist commitments, not article defects.

3. **Length is at soft threshold (109%)**: Future reviews should avoid expansion. Any additions need equivalent cuts.

4. **The article has reached maturity**: Minor precision improvements were made (Fisher, MWI), but the structure and argumentation are solid. Future reviews should focus on verification of factual claims as new research emerges, not further restructuring.
