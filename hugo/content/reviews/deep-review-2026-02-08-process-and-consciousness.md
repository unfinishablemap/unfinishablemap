**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article's attributions are accurate, positions are consistently maintained, and source/Map separation is clear throughout.

### Medium Issues Found
- **"The self-defeat is obvious" overstatement**: The argument from reason is strong but contested; functionalists claim physical systems can track normative relationships. **Resolution**: Softened language, added brief engagement with functionalist response (thermostat analogy for why causal correlation differs from normative grasp), and added cross-link to `[argument-from-reason](/topics/argument-from-reason/)`.
- **MWI section didn't address strongest Everettian response**: Each branch would experience continuity, so phenomenology alone can't distinguish collapse from branching. **Resolution**: Added explicit engagement with the Everettian response, then showed how process philosophy reveals its cost—prehensive inheritance becoming "metaphysically promiscuous" across branches.
- **Stapp paragraph lacked specific citation and understated controversy**: "This remains controversial" was thin. **Resolution**: Added *Mindful Universe* (2011) citation and specified the nature of the controversy (whether Stapp's QM interpretation is standard).
- **Testability admission creates tension with physics parallels**: The article admits process philosophy is metaphysical but draws parallels with quantum mechanics. This tension exists but is inherent in the subject matter—flagged but not "fixed" as it reflects genuine philosophical difficulty.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Functionalist response to argument from reason**: Physical systems can track normative relationships through appropriate causal structure. Addressed with thermostat analogy showing correlation ≠ understanding.
- **Everettian response to phenomenological argument against MWI**: Each branch experiences continuity. Addressed by showing process philosophy reveals the metaphysical cost—promiscuous prehensive inheritance dissolves the "thisness" of identity.
- **Eliminativist objection**: The opening begs the question by treating experience as paradigmatic. Noted but not addressed—this is an expected tenet-level disagreement, not a flaw.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- The philosophical tradeoff passage (interaction problem vs. combination problem) — genuine philosophical insight, cleanly articulated
- The rock/wave analogy for Whitehead's occasions — makes abstract metaphysics accessible
- The melody analogy deployed at multiple points — effective and consistent
- The synthesis section showing what the Map takes and leaves from process philosophy
- The testability admission — intellectual honesty that strengthens rather than weakens
- The closing paragraph's eloquence
- Consistent structure throughout: present process view → Map agreement → Map divergence

### Enhancements Made
- Strengthened argument from reason passage with functionalist engagement
- Added cross-link to `[argument-from-reason](/topics/argument-from-reason/)`
- Improved MWI section with Everettian response and process-philosophical counter
- Added Stapp citation (*Mindful Universe*) and specified controversy
- Changed "non-structural" to "qualitative" for precision in describing consciousness

### Cross-links Added
- [argument-from-reason](/topics/argument-from-reason/) (new)

## Remaining Items

None. All medium issues were addressed in this review.

## Stability Notes

- **Eliminativist/physicalist disagreement with the opening premise** (experience as paradigmatic) is a bedrock philosophical disagreement reflecting the Map's tenets. Future reviews should not flag this as a problem.
- **The tension between process philosophy as metaphysical framework and its parallels with quantum physics** is inherent in the subject. The article handles it well with the testability note. Future reviews should not try to resolve what is genuinely unresolvable.
- **Panpsychism vs. interactionist dualism** is clearly articulated as a divergence. The article's position is stable and well-argued. Future reviews should not re-open the question of whether the Map should adopt panpsychism instead.
