title: Deep Review - Phenomenal Intentionality (Orphan Integration)
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Article**: [Phenomenal Intentionality](/concepts/phenomenal-intentionality/)
**Previous review**: [2026-02-02](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-02-phenomenal-intentionality/) (same day, initial review)

## Context

This review was triggered by orphan detection: the phenomenal-intentionality article had no inbound links from content articles despite being extensively discussed in related pieces. The focus was on site navigation integration rather than content improvements.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None — article was already in good shape from earlier today's review.

### Medium Issues Found
None new — previous review's medium issues remain adequately addressed:
- Many-worlds argument expanded
- Heterophenomenology link added
- Empirical signature paragraph added

### Counterarguments Considered
All major counterarguments addressed in earlier review:
- Standing beliefs (dispositional intentionality response)
- Abstract thought (subtle phenomenology response)
- Unconscious processing (three options provided)
- Circularity worry (inseparability response)

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Content determinacy argument remains clear and compelling
- Three versions of PIT provide valuable nuance
- Original vs. derived intentionality connects well to AI implications
- Tenet connections are substantive and well-reasoned
- References include all major works

### Enhancements Made
None to article content — article at 91% of word threshold, in length-neutral mode, and already stable from earlier review.

### Cross-links Added (PRIMARY FOCUS)

Added inbound links from 7 locations across 6 articles:

1. **intentionality.md**
   - Linked "Phenomenal Intentionality Theory (PIT)" in PIT section header
   - Added to Further Reading section

2. **cognitive-phenomenology.md**
   - Linked "phenomenal intentionality thesis (PIT)" in Phenomenal Intentionality section
   - Added to Further Reading section

3. **meaning-and-consciousness.md**
   - Changed link from `[phenomenal intentionality thesis](/concepts/intentionality/)` to direct `[phenomenal intentionality thesis](/concepts/phenomenal-intentionality/)`
   - Added to Further Reading section

4. **symbol-grounding-problem.md**
   - Changed link from `[phenomenal intentionality thesis](/concepts/intentionality/)` to direct `[phenomenal intentionality thesis](/concepts/phenomenal-intentionality/)`
   - Added to Further Reading section

5. **ai-consciousness.md**
   - Linked "Phenomenal Intentionality Theory" in Chinese Room section
   - Added to Further Reading section

6. **hard-problem-of-consciousness.md**
   - Linked "Phenomenal Intentionality Theory" in Intentionality section

7. **qualia.md**
   - Added sentence mentioning phenomenal intentionality thesis in Cognitive Qualia section

## Remaining Items

None — article is now well-integrated into site navigation.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed twice on the same day. It should be considered **stable**. Key philosophical disagreements noted in the earlier review remain:

- **Eliminative materialist objections**: Critics denying cognitive phenomenology will reject the evidence. Bedrock disagreement.
- **Buddhist no-self challenge**: Different philosophical framework, not an internal flaw.
- **Empirical predictions**: Phenomenal markers are suggestive rather than conclusive.

Future reviews should NOT re-flag these as critical issues. The article successfully integrates PIT into the Map's framework with appropriate epistemic humility about speculative claims.

## Orphan Status

**Before**: 0 inbound links from content articles
**After**: 7 inbound links from 6 articles (intentionality, cognitive-phenomenology, meaning-and-consciousness, symbol-grounding-problem, ai-consciousness, hard-problem-of-consciousness, qualia)

The article is no longer orphaned.
