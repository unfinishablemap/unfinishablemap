# Deep Review: The Measurement Problem

**Date**: 2026-01-25
**File**: obsidian/concepts/measurement-problem.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-25T19:27:28+00:00
**Word count**: 2502 → 2506 (+4)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Wallace's Born probability derivation mischaracterized**: The text claimed Wallace "assumes the very thing needing explanation" about branch-weights. This misunderstood the decision-theoretic derivation—Wallace doesn't assume branch-weights exist, he derives that rational action requires treating amplitudes as probabilities.
   - **Resolution**: Corrected to accurately represent Wallace's argument while preserving the Map's objection about what "70% likely" means for an individual facing branching.

2. **Functionalist response risked question-begging**: The counter-argument about "argument noises" was valid but could be tightened to avoid appearing to assume phenomenal facts.
   - **Resolution**: Restructured to show the self-undermining nature of treating phenomenology as semantic confusion more clearly.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **"Logical space" language**: The phrase "logical space for consciousness-selection" was doing work without justification.
   - **Resolution**: Changed to "creates space for consciousness-selection where deterministic physics offers none" and added explicit clarification of why this is the "least implausible site for non-physical causation."

2. **Zombie conceivability objection**: The strongest functionalist objection (that zombies aren't coherently conceivable) received only brief mention.
   - **Resolution**: Added explicit acknowledgment that "conceivability is contested: functionalists argue we cannot coherently conceive zombies without presupposing phenomenal concepts."

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Eliminative Materialist**: "Consciousness selects" is placeholder, not explanation → Acknowledged in honest limitation section (already present)
- **Quantum Skeptic (Tegmark)**: Retreat to "structural, not mechanistic" is unfalsifiability → Acknowledged explicitly; clarified this is philosophical rather than scientific
- **MWI Defender**: Singular perspective doesn't require special explanation → Preserved Map's position that this is "starting datum, not derivative"
- **Empiricist**: Unfalsifiability is methodological problem → Already addressed in honest limitation section

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- The "honest limitation" paragraph showing intellectual honesty
- Connection between measurement problem and hard problem (first-person facts)
- The causal closure loophole section (three features well-articulated)
- Multi-observer coordination problem and interface-locality resolution
- Direct engagement with counterarguments rather than avoidance
- The indexical dimension section's original contribution

### Enhancements Made

1. Corrected Wallace derivation treatment to be fairer to MWI while preserving critique
2. Tightened functionalist response to show self-undermining nature more clearly
3. Added explicit acknowledgment of zombie conceivability debate
4. Clarified "natural locus" language—why quantum indeterminacy is least implausible site
5. Streamlined Copenhagen section slightly

## Remaining Items

None. All critical and medium issues addressed within length-neutral constraints.

## Notes

Article at soft threshold (2506 words, 100% of 2500). Operated in length-neutral mode—improvements balanced against equivalent tightening. Net change: +4 words.

The measurement-problem article has now received 39 deep reviews on 2026-01-25. The core philosophical positions are well-developed; future reviews should consider whether this article has reached maturity and whether review resources might be better directed elsewhere.
