# Deep Review: Causal Closure of the Physical

**Date**: 2026-01-20
**File**: obsidian/concepts/causal-closure.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Missing decoherence engagement**: The quantum exception section argued that physics is incomplete at measurement without addressing the main empirical objection—that decoherence destroys superpositions before consciousness could act. **Resolution**: Added dedicated "decoherence challenge" paragraph with link to quantum-consciousness.md for detailed treatment, noting Hameroff's revised timescales and that decoherence doesn't solve the measurement problem.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Probabilistic causation unaddressed**: Physicalists argue that probabilistic causation is still causation—wave function explains outcomes even if not deterministically. Article didn't engage this. **Resolution**: Added "physicalist response" paragraph distinguishing statistical explanation from causal sufficiency.

- **Luck objection missing**: Free will section claimed consciousness can "select" undetermined outcomes without addressing the standard objection that undetermined = random. **Resolution**: Added paragraph on luck objection with link to luck-objection.md and explanation of selection vs randomness distinction.

- **Tu quoque unacknowledged**: Article criticized closure as metaphysical assumption while presenting site's position as though empirically established. **Resolution**: Added paragraph explicitly acknowledging both positions involve metaphysical commitments beyond empirical evidence.

### Counterarguments Considered
- Eliminative materialist: consciousness reports may not reflect genuine phenomenal information (not directly addressed—would require substantial restructuring)
- Many-worlds defender: MWI provides alternative where physics IS complete (addressed via existing link to many-worlds.md)
- Buddhist philosopher: substance metaphysics may not be required (noted for future consideration, not addressed in this review)

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Kim's formulation dilemma section (lines 76-82): Excellent articulation of the catch-22 facing closure advocates
- Self-stultification argument (lines 120-122): Strong reflexive argument against epiphenomenalism
- Coherence of rejection section (lines 154-162): Good balance of acknowledging concerns while maintaining position
- Opening summary: Clear, confident statement of the article's purpose and site's position

### Enhancements Made
- Added physicalist response and decoherence challenge subsections to strengthen quantum exception argument
- Added luck objection response in free will section
- Added epistemological humility paragraph acknowledging site's own metaphysical commitments
- Expanded Further Reading with luck-objection, mysterianism, and explanatory-gap links

### Cross-links Added
- [luck-objection](/concepts/luck-objection/) — New link in body and Further Reading
- [mysterianism](/concepts/mysterianism/) — New link in Further Reading
- [explanatory-gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/) — New link in Further Reading
- [quantum-consciousness](/concepts/quantum-consciousness/#the-decoherence-objection) — New section anchor link

## Remaining Items

None. All critical and medium issues were addressed in this session. Low-priority items (Buddhist metaphysics framing, eliminativist response to consciousness reporting) deferred as they would require substantial restructuring beyond scope of this review.
