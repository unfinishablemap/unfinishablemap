title: Deep Review - Mechanisms of the Attention-Consciousness Interface (Orphan Integration)
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Article**: [Mechanisms of the Attention-Consciousness Interface](/topics/attention-interface-mechanisms/)
**Previous review**: [2026-02-02](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-02-attention-interface-mechanisms/) (earlier same day)
**Focus**: Orphan integration (file had no inbound links)

## Review Context

This review was triggered because `attention-interface-mechanisms.md` was identified as orphaned—having no inbound links from other content articles. The earlier review (same day, 04:52 UTC) addressed content quality and found no critical issues. This follow-up focuses specifically on integrating the article into the site's navigation through cross-references.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article content remains in good shape from the earlier review.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Orphan status**: The article had only 1 inbound link (from `concepts/attention-as-interface.md`) despite being highly relevant to multiple other articles.
- **Resolution**: Added cross-references from 7 related articles (see below).

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
All strengths identified in the earlier review remain intact:
- Clear opening statement of the hypothesis
- Excellent tables for candidate sites and timing constraints
- Honest engagement with challenges
- Specific falsification conditions
- Epistemic humility ("The Map doesn't commit to a specific mechanism")

### Cross-links Added

The following articles now link to `[attention-interface-mechanisms](/topics/attention-interface-mechanisms/)`:

1. **[stapp-quantum-mind](/concepts/stapp-quantum-mind/)** — Added contextual link in the opening section pointing to candidate sites and timing constraints
2. **[quantum-consciousness](/concepts/quantum-consciousness/)** — Added to "Mechanisms and timing" Further Reading section
3. **[decoherence](/concepts/decoherence/)** — Added to Further Reading section
4. **[structure-of-attention](/topics/structure-of-attention/)** — Added both in-text reference (at 300ms timing discussion) and Further Reading link
5. **[mental-effort](/concepts/mental-effort/)** — Added to Further Reading section
6. **[free-will](/topics/free-will/)** — Added contextual link in the mechanisms discussion section
7. **[psychophysical-coupling](/concepts/psychophysical-coupling/)** — Added to Further Reading section

### Rationale for Link Placements

- **In-text links** (stapp-quantum-mind, structure-of-attention, free-will): Placed where the discussion naturally leads to wanting more detail on mechanisms
- **Further Reading links** (quantum-consciousness, decoherence, mental-effort, psychophysical-coupling): Added to comprehensive "Further Reading" sections where related mechanism articles are listed

## Remaining Items

None. The article is now well-integrated into the site navigation.

## Stability Notes

- The orphan integration addressed a structural issue, not a content issue
- No content changes were made to the target article itself (reviewed earlier today)
- Future reviews should not flag this article as orphaned—it now has 8 inbound links
