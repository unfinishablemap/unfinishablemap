title: Deep Review - Reasons-Responsiveness
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-04
**Article**: [Reasons-Responsiveness](/concepts/reasons-responsiveness/)
**Previous review**: [2026-02-02](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-02-reasons-responsiveness/)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article has no factual errors, attribution problems, internal contradictions, or missing required sections.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Generality problem section was thin**: Only 4 sentences on a significant epistemological challenge.
   - *Resolution*: Added concrete "barn façade country" example and explicit connection to how this smuggles in normativity.

2. **Missing link to phenomenal-consciousness**: Article discusses phenomenal consciousness extensively without linking to the concept page.
   - *Resolution*: Added wikilink to [phenomenal-consciousness](/concepts/phenomenal-consciousness/) and added to frontmatter concepts.

3. **Fischer & Ravizza reference underdeveloped**: Citation noted their framework without explaining its specific contribution.
   - *Resolution*: Expanded reference annotation to explain "moderate reasons-responsiveness" and the strong/weak distinction.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative Materialist**: Normative vocabulary will be eliminated by mature neuroscience
  - Not critical; article engages via argument from reason
- **Functionalist (Dennett)**: "Grasping" is just computational relationship
  - Bedrock disagreement per previous review; article acknowledges contestation
- **Buddhist non-self**: Who grasps reasons if no unified self?
  - Valid challenge but outside article's dualist scope

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- The Sellars space-of-reasons/space-of-causes distinction as philosophical foundation
- The comparison table (lucky indeterminism vs. reasons-responsive selection)
- Phenomenological descriptions of deliberation as active engagement
- The "felt valence" of reasons as distinctive contribution
- LLM section's epistemic humility about contested territory
- Strong cross-linking to related concepts

### Enhancements Made
1. Added [phenomenal-consciousness](/concepts/phenomenal-consciousness/) link where phenomenal awareness is discussed
2. Expanded generality problem with concrete barn façade example
3. Enriched Fischer & Ravizza reference with moderate/strong/weak distinction

### Cross-links Added
- [phenomenal-consciousness](/concepts/phenomenal-consciousness/) (in text and frontmatter)

## Remaining Items

None. The article is in strong shape after two reviews.

## Stability Notes

This is the second deep review of this article (first was 2026-02-02). The article has reached stability:

1. **Functionalist challenge is a bedrock disagreement**: The article presents the challenge fairly, offers a criterion (why vs. that distinction), and acknowledges it remains contested. Future reviews should NOT re-flag "functionalists still disagree."

2. **Quantum mechanism is appropriately loose**: The article correctly presents consciousness-selection as operating "where physics leaves outcomes undetermined" without overcommitting to specific proposals. Future reviews should NOT demand more mechanism specificity.

3. **LLM challenge handled with epistemic humility**: The article acknowledges LLMs as a "genuine challenge case" without either dismissing or conceding the challenge. This balanced treatment should be preserved.

The improvements in this review were minor (cross-link, example, reference expansion)—indicative of convergence rather than ongoing problems.
