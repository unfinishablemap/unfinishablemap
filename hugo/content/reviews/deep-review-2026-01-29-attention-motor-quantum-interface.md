# Deep Review: Attention-Motor Quantum Interface

**Date**: 2026-01-29
**File**: obsidian/concepts/attention-motor-quantum-interface.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-26 (of earlier version; article was recreated 2026-01-29 via expand-topic after coalesce)

## Context

This article was newly created on 2026-01-29 via `expand-topic` after the previous version was merged into motor-selection.md via coalesce. The previous review (2026-01-26) addressed an earlier, longer version (3461 words). This version is 1493 words and represents a fresh treatment of the concept.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Six adversarial personas applied critical scrutiny.

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article is well-sourced, clearly separates Map interpretation from empirical claims, and acknowledges its limitations appropriately.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Decoherence response oversimplified**: Original text presented Hameroff's coherence time estimates as definitively seven orders of magnitude longer than Tegmark's without noting that they address different mechanisms and neither has secured consensus. **Resolved**: Added nuance acknowledging the debate remains open.

- **PMTA quote ambiguity**: Line 39-40 presented the PMTA core claim in quotation marks but appeared to be paraphrase rather than direct quote. **Resolved**: Removed quotation marks, presented as paraphrase.

- **Heterophenomenology not engaged**: The article relies on phenomenology of effort without addressing Dennett's heterophenomenology. **Deferred**: This is a bedrock philosophical disagreement noted in the previous review. The article's "honest gap" section acknowledges explanatory limits without claiming phenomenology proves non-physical causation.

### Counterarguments Considered
- Neural dynamics sufficiency (Churchland) → Addressed in "Challenges and Responses" section
- Quantum decoherence (Tegmark) → Addressed with improved nuance
- MWI interpretation (Deutsch) → Correctly identified as tenet position, not flaw
- Lack of novel predictions (Popper) → Acknowledged via "honest gap" section
- No-self critique (Nagarjuna) → Deferred; would require substantial expansion

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

Six sympathetic personas identified strengths and opportunities.

### Strengths Preserved
- Front-loaded opening summary (survives truncation, states core claim immediately)
- Three-layer model (neural computation → dopamine → consciousness)
- "Honest gap" section (distinguishes locating interface from explaining mechanism)
- Clear source/Map separation (explicitly notes PMTA proponents don't endorse dualism)
- Neural signatures table (parallel evidence across domains)
- Timing convergence argument (280-300ms window)
- Libet dissolution structure

### Enhancements Made
- Clarified PMTA claim as paraphrase rather than direct quote
- Added nuance to decoherence debate (Tegmark vs. Hameroff addressing different mechanisms)
- Added [agent-causation](/concepts/agent-causation/) to Further Reading section

### Cross-links Added
- [agent-causation](/concepts/agent-causation/) (in Further Reading)

## Word Count

- Before: 1493 words (60% of 2500 soft threshold)
- After: 1514 words (61% of 2500 soft threshold)
- Net change: +21 words

Article is well under soft threshold; no length-neutral operation required.

## Remaining Items

- **Heterophenomenology engagement**: Could acknowledge Dennett's position that phenomenology reports are behavioral data. Deferred as bedrock disagreement.

- **No-self interpretation**: Could note selection phenomenology doesn't require substantial self. Deferred; would require expansion beyond scope.

- **Novel falsifiable predictions**: The framework identifies "where" but not a distinguishing empirical test. Acknowledged via "honest gap" section; this is a known limitation of most philosophical frameworks.

## Stability Notes

This is the first deep review of the recreated article. The content is well-structured and avoids the issues flagged in the previous version:

1. **Attribution accuracy**: All source claims are properly separated from Map interpretation
2. **Length appropriate**: At 61% of soft threshold, room exists for future enhancement
3. **Decoherence claim**: Now properly nuanced rather than appearing to settle a contested debate

The article reaches a good baseline. Future reviews should focus on:
- Factual errors or new research findings
- Opportunities to strengthen cross-linking as related content develops
- NOT re-engaging bedrock philosophical disagreements (heterophenomenology, MWI, no-self)
