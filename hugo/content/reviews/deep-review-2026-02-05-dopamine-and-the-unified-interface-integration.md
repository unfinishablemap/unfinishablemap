title: Deep Review - Dopamine and the Unified Interface (Integration)
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-05
**Article**: [Dopamine and the Unified Interface](/topics/dopamine-and-the-unified-interface/)
**Previous review**: [2026-02-05](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-05-dopamine-and-the-unified-interface/)
**Focus**: Orphan integration—adding inbound links from related articles

## Context

This article had no inbound links despite being substantively connected to the dopamine and attention-motor interface content cluster. The previous deep review (same day, earlier) found no critical issues and marked the article as reaching stability. This follow-up review focused exclusively on integrating the orphaned article into site navigation through cross-references.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The previous review thoroughly addressed content quality. No new issues identified.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Orphan status**: The article had zero inbound links despite discussing dopamine's role in selection, salience, and the unified interface—topics covered extensively in related concept pages.
   - **Resolution**: Added cross-links from 6 related articles (see below)

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

All strengths from previous review remain intact:
- Three-layer architecture framework (appropriately hedged)
- Tonic/phasic dopamine distinction
- Effort phenomenology parallel
- Parkinson's analysis
- Honest Limitation section
- Relation to Site Perspective section

### Cross-links Added

Added `[dopamine-and-the-unified-interface](/topics/dopamine-and-the-unified-interface/)` to the Further Reading sections of:

1. **[attention-motor-quantum-interface](/attention-motor-quantum-interface/)** — "Comprehensive treatment of dopamine's preparatory role in conscious selection"
2. **[dopamine-selection-interface](/dopamine-selection-interface/)** — "Comprehensive topics treatment: salience bridge, tonic/phasic modes, theta oscillations"
3. **[motor-selection](/concepts/motor-selection/)** — "How dopamine prepares the unified attention-motor system for conscious selection"
4. **[attention-disorders-and-quantum-interface](/topics/attention-disorders-and-quantum-interface/)** — "Salience bridge, tonic/phasic modes, and what Parkinson's reveals about the interface"
5. **[voluntary-attention](/voluntary-attention/)** — "Why dopamine serves both attention and motor systems—because they are one"
6. **[mental-effort](/concepts/mental-effort/)** — "Dopamine prepares the selection interface; theta oscillations provide the timing substrate"

### Integration Rationale

The dopamine topics article provides a narrative synthesis that complements the concept pages:
- It integrates the salience bridge concept (not covered elsewhere)
- It provides the learning primacy hypothesis response
- It details what Parkinson's reveals as a "window" into interface dysfunction
- It connects theta oscillations to the timing substrate for selection

These are unique contributions not duplicated in [dopamine-selection-interface](/dopamine-selection-interface/) or other articles.

## Word Count

- **Before**: 1973 words
- **After**: 1973 words (no content changes to main article)
- **Status**: 66% of 3000 soft threshold — well within limits

## Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| dopamine-and-the-unified-interface.md | Timestamp update only |
| attention-motor-quantum-interface.md | Added cross-link |
| dopamine-selection-interface.md | Added cross-link |
| motor-selection.md | Added cross-link |
| attention-disorders-and-quantum-interface.md | Added cross-link |
| voluntary-attention.md | Added cross-link |
| mental-effort.md | Added cross-link |

## Remaining Items

None. The orphan integration is complete. The article now has 6 inbound links from closely related content.

## Stability Notes

The article has now reached full integration with the dopamine-attention-motor content cluster. Future reviews should NOT re-flag:

- The philosophical disagreements noted in the previous review (bedrock disagreements)
- The orphan status (now resolved)

The article is stable for content and navigation.
