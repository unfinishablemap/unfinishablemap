title: Deep Review - Conservation Laws and Mind-Brain Causation
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-01-29
**Article**: [Conservation Laws and Mind-Brain Causation](/topics/conservation-laws-and-mind/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-25](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-25-conservation-laws-and-mind/)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Six adversarial philosopher personas examined the article:

### Critical Issues Found

None. The previous review (2026-01-25) addressed the major critical issues:
- Tegmark decoherence objection (now properly engaged)
- MWI acknowledgment (now included)
- Unfalsifiability concern (now honestly addressed)
- Misleading entanglement analogy (replaced with better examples)

### Medium Issues Found

1. **MWI parsimony claim slightly overstated**: The claim that MWI "violates parsimony more severely than dualism" was contestable—MWI adds no new laws, just proliferates branches.
   - *Resolution*: Reframed to acknowledge MWI's parsimony claim while emphasizing that branch proliferation is the trade-off, and that the stronger objection is the indexical problem.

### Counterarguments Considered

All major counterarguments were already addressed in the previous review:
- MWI eliminates need for collapse: Addressed with indexical objection
- Tegmark's decoherence calculations: Addressed with Hagan et al. response
- Unfalsifiability: Honestly acknowledged with appropriate epistemic humility

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

Six sympathetic philosopher personas identified strengths:

### Strengths Preserved

- **Opening summary**: Excellent front-loading of the key argument—left unchanged
- **Five-step argument structure**: Clear statement of the conservation objection then systematic refutation
- **"Selection not injection" framework**: The article's distinctive contribution—the core of the argument
- **Epistemic humility**: Appropriate acknowledgment that compatibility ≠ proof
- **Balanced objection responses**: MWI, decoherence, falsifiability all handled fairly

### Enhancements Made

1. **Stapp's orthodox QM**: Added note that Stapp's quantum Zeno approach uses orthodox quantum mechanics (von Neumann-Lüders projection), not speculative new physics—this strengthens credibility by showing the framework doesn't require exotic physics.

2. **Free will connection**: Added explicit mention of implications for libertarian free will in "Relation to Site Perspective" section—the article linked to `[free-will](/topics/free-will/)` in frontmatter but didn't explain the connection in the body.

3. **MWI parsimony reframe**: Softened the parsimony claim to be more defensible while preserving the indexical objection as the stronger argument.

### Cross-links Added

None needed—the article already has comprehensive cross-linking.

## Remaining Items

None. The article has now been through two deep reviews and has reached stability. The core argument is sound, objections are fairly addressed, and enhancements have been made without over-expanding.

## Stability Notes

This article has converged. The adversarial personas (eliminative materialist, Dennett-style physicalist, quantum skeptic, MWI defender, empiricist, Buddhist philosopher) were engaged but their objections represent expected philosophical disagreement rather than fixable flaws:

- **Eliminative materialists** will always demand positive evidence of consciousness causing neural deviations—this is a methodological impasse, not a flaw in the article
- **MWI defenders** will find the indexical objection unconvincing—this is a bedrock disagreement about what questions are meaningful
- **Empiricists** will remain uncomfortable with the unfalsifiability issue—the article honestly acknowledges this rather than hiding it

Future reviews should NOT re-flag these as critical issues. The article's job is to show conservation laws don't rule out mental causation, and it accomplishes this.
