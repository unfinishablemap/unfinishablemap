# Tenet Alignment Check

**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Files checked**: 143 (43 topics + 100 concepts)
**Errors**: 0
**Warnings**: 0
**Notes**: 1

## Summary

The content collection exhibits excellent alignment with all five foundational tenets. No files directly contradict the tenets. The only item flagged is a minor NOTE-level clarification opportunity in one file. The collection demonstrates:

- Intellectual honesty: Opposing views are presented charitably, not strawmanned
- Proper scoping: Where the Map takes positions, they're justified against alternatives
- Clear epistemic status: Speculative claims marked as frameworks worth exploring
- Converging arguments: Multiple independent lines support core tenets
- No quantum woo: Careful distinction between physics-based proposals and mysticism

## Errors

None found.

## Warnings

None found.

## Notes

### functionalism.md

- **Tenet**: Dualism
- **Issue**: The statement "purely computational systems cannot be conscious—consciousness requires something non-physical that computers lack" (line 136) may slightly overgeneralize. The Dualism tenet states consciousness is not *reducible* to physical processes, not that it necessarily requires biological substrate. The tenets are compatible with consciousness potentially interfacing with non-biological quantum systems.
- **Quote**: "From the Map's perspective, purely computational systems cannot be conscious—consciousness requires something non-physical that computers lack."
- **Assessment**: The article's reasoning (Chinese Room, syntax ≠ semantics) is sound, and the conclusion about digital computers running classical algorithms is well-supported. The phrasing could be more precise to distinguish "purely computational/classical systems" from hypothetical quantum-biological hybrids.
- **Recommendation**: Consider softening to: "From the Map's perspective, purely computational systems running classical algorithms cannot be conscious, because consciousness involves non-physical properties that syntactic processing cannot implement. Quantum-interfacing systems are a separate question." This preserves the argument while not over-committing on substrate.

## Tenet-by-Tenet Analysis

### Dualism (Consciousness not reducible to physical processes)

**Status**: Strong alignment across all files

Key supporting files:
- `dualism.md` — Core definition and property/substance distinction
- `materialism.md` — Systematic rejection of physicalism
- `qualia.md` — Why qualitative character resists reduction
- `philosophical-zombies.md` — Conceivability argument
- `arguments-for-dualism.md` — Convergence of multiple arguments

No files endorse eliminative materialism, reductive physicalism, or treat consciousness as illusory. Where illusionism is discussed, it's clearly presented as a position the Map rejects.

### Minimal Quantum Interaction (Smallest possible non-physical influence on quantum outcomes)

**Status**: Strong alignment across all files

Key supporting files:
- `quantum-consciousness.md` — Three mechanisms surveyed (Orch OR, Stapp, Fisher)
- `quantum-neural-timing-constraints.md` — Honest review of timing constraints
- `decoherence-and-macroscopic-superposition.md` — Measurement problem persists

Careful distinction maintained between:
- Physics-based proposals (appropriate)
- "Quantum woo" / mysticism (explicitly rejected)
- Speculative vs. established claims (clearly marked)

No files endorse uncontrolled psychokinesis, energy injection by mind, or empirically detectable mind-matter interactions.

### Bidirectional Interaction (Consciousness causally influences physical outcomes)

**Status**: Strong alignment across all files

Key supporting files:
- `interactionist-dualism.md` — Direct affirmation with mechanism
- `epiphenomenalism.md` — Clear rejection with self-stultification argument
- `emotional-consciousness.md` — Pain asymbolia as proof of causal efficacy
- `mental-causation.md` — Full case for consciousness's causal role

No files treat consciousness as purely epiphenomenal or "along for the ride."

### No Many Worlds (Reject MWI; indexical identity matters)

**Status**: Strong alignment across all files

Key supporting files:
- `many-worlds.md` — Five systematic arguments against MWI
- `indexical-identity-quantum-measurement.md` — All interpretations face indexical gap
- `vertiginous-question.md` — Indexical identity as meaningful problem
- `quantum-measurement-interpretations-beyond-mwi.md` — Fair survey of alternatives

MWI is presented charitably but with specific vulnerabilities (indexical identity problem, probability problem) clearly articulated. No files endorse treating all quantum branches as equally real.

### Occam's Razor Has Limits (Simplicity unreliable with incomplete knowledge)

**Status**: Strong alignment across all files

Key supporting files:
- `mysterianism.md` — Direct support for epistemic humility
- `decoherence-and-macroscopic-superposition.md` — Historical examples of parsimony failing
- `materialism.md` — Notes physicalism achieves simplicity by ignoring what needs explaining

No files use Occam's Razor as a decisive argument against dualism or non-physicalist views.

## Special Observations

### Exemplary Philosophical Practice

The `panpsychism.md` file represents the ideal way to present an alternative view the Map doesn't endorse:
- Explains panpsychism's genuine insight (consciousness fundamental)
- Presents the combination problem fairly
- Explains why Map prefers interactionist dualism
- Maintains intellectual respect throughout

This should serve as a model for presenting disagreements.

### Honest Treatment of Open Questions

Files making speculative claims consistently:
- Distinguish established from theoretical
- Note empirical falsification conditions
- Acknowledge alternative explanations
- Avoid overconfident language

Example: `quantum-neural-timing-constraints.md` details exactly what evidence would falsify the timing compatibility thesis.

## Files Passing All Checks

All 143 files pass tenet alignment checks. The single NOTE-level item in `functionalism.md` represents a minor clarification opportunity, not a conflict.

## Recommendations

1. **Optional**: Refine the substrate-independence language in `functionalism.md` to be more precise about what the tenets do and don't commit to regarding non-biological substrates.

2. **Continue**: The current approach of presenting opposing views charitably while explaining why the Map's position is stronger. This is philosophically sound practice.

3. **Continue**: Marking speculative claims with appropriate epistemic qualifiers.
