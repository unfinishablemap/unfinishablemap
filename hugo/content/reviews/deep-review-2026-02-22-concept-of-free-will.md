**Date**: 2026-02-22
**Article**: [Free Will](/concepts/concept-of-free-will/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article is well-structured, attributions are accurate, and the writing follows the style guide.

### Medium Issues Found
- [Missing cross-references]: Article had no links to [reasons-responsiveness](/concepts/reasons-responsiveness/), [control-theoretic-will](/concepts/control-theoretic-will/), [spontaneous-intentional-action](/concepts/spontaneous-intentional-action/), or [authentic-vs-inauthentic-choice](/topics/authentic-vs-inauthentic-choice/) — closely related published concepts. **Resolution**: Added all four to frontmatter concepts/related_articles and inline links.
- [No mention of non-deliberative selection]: The article focused exclusively on deliberate choice, missing that agent-causal selection also operates without deliberation (spontaneous intentional action). **Resolution**: Added paragraph on spontaneous intentional action in the Physical Interface section.
- [Orphan status]: Article had zero inbound links from other articles. **Resolution**: Added inbound cross-references from 8 related articles.

### Counterarguments Considered
- Compatibilist dismissal is quick but appropriate for a concept article (not a topic-length treatment)
- Buddhist perspectives on agency not engaged, but acceptable for Western agent-causal focus
- All six adversarial personas found expected philosophical disagreements but no fixable flaws

## Attribution Accuracy Check
All six attributions verified:
- Chisholm (1964): transeunt/immanent distinction — correct
- Lowe (2008): substance causation — correct
- Fischer/Frankfurt: reasons-responsiveness/mesh theories — correct
- Schurger et al. (2012): RP as neural noise — correct
- James: effort of attention quote — correct
- Harris: hard determinism — correct

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening summary (excellent front-loading, concise)
- "Why Agent Causation" section (clearest treatment of why event-causal libertarianism fails)
- Three-line phenomenological evidence structure
- Relation to Site Perspective (engages all five tenets substantively)
- "What Would Challenge This View" (specific, falsifiable)
- Self-stultification argument against epiphenomenalism

### Enhancements Made
- Added reasons-responsiveness paragraph in "Why Agent Causation" section explaining how reasons make selection contrastively explicable
- Added control-theoretic-will reference showing consciousness as low-bandwidth controller
- Added spontaneous-intentional-action paragraph showing selection without deliberation
- Expanded Further Reading with 4 new entries
- Added 3 new concepts to frontmatter
- Added 1 new related_article to frontmatter

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues were addressed in this review.

## Stability Notes

The article is newly created (2026-02-20) and this is its first review. The core arguments are sound and well-structured. The main work was integration — connecting this orphaned concept article into the site's cross-reference network. The philosophical positions taken (agent-causal libertarianism, rejection of compatibilism) are foundational Map commitments and represent bedrock positions, not issues to re-flag in future reviews.
