title: Deep Review - Libet Experiments and the Neuroscience of Volition
topics: []

**Date**: 2026-02-28
**Article**: [Libet Experiments and the Neuroscience of Volition](/concepts/libet-experiments/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-27](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-27-libet-experiments/)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. This is the third review of a mature article. All critical issues were resolved in the first review (2026-01-20): falsifiability section, illusionism engagement, decoherence challenge. The second review (2026-01-27) integrated the indexical gap and cross-linked to quantum-measurement-and-subjective-probability.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Apex synthesis sentence misplaced in Process Philosophy section** — A sentence about the time-consciousness-growing-block apex article was appended to the Process Philosophy section during a cross-review of that apex piece. It broke the section's philosophical flow and read as promotional.
   - **Resolution**: Relocated to Further Reading where it fits naturally as a cross-link with brief description.

2. **Missing cross-links to five newer articles** — Several concept/topic pages created since the last review (Jan 27) are directly relevant: timing-gap-problem, time-symmetric-selection-mechanism, spontaneous-intentional-action, control-theoretic-will, neural-correlates-of-consciousness.
   - **Resolution**: Added cross-links for the three most relevant (timing-gap-problem, time-symmetric-selection-mechanism, control-theoretic-will) in Further Reading. Added timing-gap-problem to concepts frontmatter. The remaining two (spontaneous-intentional-action, neural-correlates-of-consciousness) are relevant but tangential—they link *to* this article already, and adding them would push an already long Further Reading section further.

3. **Redundant sentence in Extensions section** — "The brain prepares multiple possibilities; something else determines which actualizes" repeated the point already made by the 60% accuracy observation.
   - **Resolution**: Removed the redundant sentence.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Eliminative materialist (Churchland)**: Self-refutation argument against illusionism could be answered by claiming neural processes implement genuine reasoning. This is a bedrock disagreement (noted in previous reviews).

- **Quantum skeptic (Tegmark)**: The timing-gap-problem page now formalizes the decoherence timescale challenge. The article's three-pronged response (measurement problem, Zeno, quantum biology) remains adequate. Cross-link to timing-gap-problem added for readers wanting detailed treatment.

- **Many-Worlds defender (Deutsch)**: Retrocausal framework implicitly assumes single-outcome physics. Bedrock disagreement per No Many Worlds tenet.

- **Empiricist (Popper)**: Falsifiability section remains strong with six specific challenges. Scientific attributions verified: Schurger (2012), Soon et al. (2008), Sjöberg (2024), Desmurget (2009), Bode et al. (2011) all accurately represented.

- **Buddhist philosopher (Nagarjuna)**: Process philosophy section partially addresses non-substantial alternatives. Full engagement with dependent origination would require scope beyond this article.

### Attribution Accuracy Check

- All scientific claims verified against cited papers
- No misattributions detected
- Qualifiers preserved (e.g., "may be" for Schurger's noise model, "about 60%" for Soon et al.)
- Source/Map separation maintained — empirical sections present findings; Relation to Site Perspective marks Map interpretation
- No self-contradictions detected

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

1. Selection vs. initiation framing remains philosophically sophisticated
2. Schurger/Sjöberg critique sequence is devastating to the standard interpretation
3. Desmurget double-dissociation table is clear and effective
4. Falsifiability section demonstrates intellectual honesty
5. Indexical gap acknowledgment (added in previous review) shows nuance
6. Process philosophy section offers genuine non-substance alternative
7. Veto regress resolution via atemporal selection is original

### Enhancements Made

1. **Relocated apex synthesis reference** — Moved from Process Philosophy body to Further Reading, improving section flow
2. **Cross-linked to timing-gap-problem** — Readers can now find the detailed treatment of the decoherence timescale challenge
3. **Cross-linked to time-symmetric-selection-mechanism** — The dedicated article on atemporal transaction selection that resolves the Libet timing puzzle
4. **Cross-linked to control-theoretic-will** — Connects the selection model to formal control theory (will as low-bandwidth gating signal)
5. **Trimmed redundancy in Extensions section** — Removed sentence that restated the 60% prediction gap point

### Cross-links Added

- [timing-gap-problem](/concepts/timing-gap-problem/) — Decoherence timescale challenge (frontmatter + Further Reading)
- [time-symmetric-selection-mechanism](/topics/time-symmetric-selection-mechanism/) — Atemporal transaction model (Further Reading)
- [control-theoretic-will](/concepts/control-theoretic-will/) — Will as control signal (Further Reading)
- [time-consciousness-growing-block](/apex/time-consciousness-growing-block/) — Apex synthesis (relocated to Further Reading)

## Remaining Items

None. The article's content is stable.

## Stability Notes

**Philosophical disagreements (not critical issues):**
- MWI proponents will always find the retrocausal framework question-begging — bedrock disagreement (No Many Worlds tenet)
- Eliminativists will always find appeals to phenomenal consciousness question-begging — tenet-level commitment
- The indexical gap is acknowledged as an open problem — do not re-flag
- The quantum biology argument leaps from photosynthesis to neural systems — acknowledged in falsifiability section, not a flaw to fix

**Convergence assessment:** This article has reached full stability after three reviews. The first review (2026-01-20) addressed structural gaps. The second (2026-01-27) integrated cross-article insights. This third review adds cross-links to newer articles and fixes a misplaced sentence. No further structural changes needed unless significant new content is published that requires integration.

**Length note:** 3008 → 3001 words (120% of 2500 soft threshold). Article is in soft-warning range but content is substantive throughout — no candidates for further condensation without losing value.

## Metrics

- Word count: 3008 → 3001 (-7 words, length-neutral)
- Critical issues addressed: 0 (none found)
- Medium issues addressed: 3
- Cross-links added: 4
