# Tenet Alignment Check

**Date**: 2026-02-05
**Files checked**: 234 (71 topics, 163 concepts)
**Errors**: 0
**Warnings**: 0
**Notes**: 3

## Summary

All 234 content files in `obsidian/topics/` and `obsidian/concepts/` were analyzed against the five foundational tenets. The site is in excellent alignment. No file endorses or assumes positions that contradict the tenets. Three minor notes identify phrasing tensions—all in articles that explicitly support the tenets elsewhere in their text.

The content consistently:
- Treats consciousness as irreducible to physical processes (Tenet 1: Dualism)
- Proposes minimal quantum interaction without quantum mysticism (Tenet 2)
- Maintains that consciousness causally influences the physical world (Tenet 3: Bidirectional Interaction)
- Rejects the Many-Worlds Interpretation and values indexical identity (Tenet 4)
- Applies appropriate skepticism toward parsimony arguments against dualism (Tenet 5: Occam's Razor Has Limits)

Opposing views (materialism, illusionism, MWI, functionalism, epiphenomenalism) are discussed throughout the site as positions to be examined and critiqued—not endorsed. This is expected and appropriate in philosophical writing.

## Errors

None.

## Warnings

None.

## Notes

### 1. consciousness-and-language-interface.md

- **Tenet**: 1 (Dualism)
- **Issue**: One sentence in the "Why the Loss Matters" subsection could be read as suggesting the explanatory gap is merely a linguistic artifact rather than reflecting genuine ontological distinction.
- **Quote**: "not because phenomenal facts are non-physical, but because the language of physics is a poor conduit for phenomenal content"
- **Context**: The article's "Relation to Site Perspective" section explicitly argues for dualism, stating that the systematic gap "suggests consciousness includes aspects that language—and hence physical description—cannot capture." The note reflects a local phrasing tension, not the article's overall position.
- **Recommendation**: Consider rephrasing to avoid the implication that phenomenal facts might be physical. For example: "not merely because phenomenal facts are non-physical, but also because the language of physics is a poor conduit for phenomenal content."

### 2. chalmers-psychophysical-coupling.md

- **Tenet**: 3 (Bidirectional Interaction)
- **Issue**: Extended sympathetic presentation of Chalmers' tendency toward epiphenomenalism before the Map's rejection is foregrounded.
- **Quote**: "Chalmers himself tends toward this position. In his framework, consciousness *accompanies* physical processes without necessarily *affecting* them."
- **Context**: The article explicitly notes the Map's divergence on Bidirectional Interaction in its "Relation to Site Perspective" section. This is a stylistic concern—the epiphenomenalist position is presented at length before the Map's rejection appears—rather than a substantive endorsement.
- **Recommendation**: Consider adding an earlier sentence flagging that the Map diverges from Chalmers on this point, so readers encounter the site's position before the extended presentation of epiphenomenalism.

### 3. eastern-metaphysics-integration.md

- **Tenet**: 1 (Dualism)
- **Issue**: Advaita Vedanta's non-duality is presented extensively, with phrasing that could initially read as undermining the Dualism tenet before the resolution via the two-truths framework appears.
- **Quote**: "Advaita's ultimate position is non-dual: there is no real distinction between mind and matter because both are appearances within undifferentiated consciousness."
- **Context**: The article handles this tension openly through the two-truths framework and explicitly notes the Map "need not commit to ultimate metaphysical claims." The tension is acknowledged and resolved within the Map's framework.
- **Recommendation**: No change needed. The article's approach—presenting the tension honestly and resolving it—is appropriate for philosophical engagement with Eastern traditions.

## Articles on Competing Positions

The following articles discuss philosophical positions that the tenets rule out, but do so appropriately—framing them as positions the Map critiques:

- **materialism.md**: Explains why physicalism fails; core articulation of why the Dualism tenet is adopted
- **illusionism.md**: Treats illusionism as the strongest challenge while presenting comprehensive responses
- **functionalism.md**: Discusses functionalism's challenges from the Map's perspective
- **epiphenomenalism.md**: Explains the self-stultification problem; explicitly notes the tenets reject this view
- **many-worlds.md**: Presents the No Many Worlds tenet's rejection with detailed arguments
- **relational-quantum-mechanics.md**: Explains RQM's direct conflict with Bidirectional Interaction
- **attention-schema-theory.md**: Explicitly rejects AST as conflicting with the Dualism tenet
- **heterophenomenology.md**: Explicitly rejects Dennett's method as methodological eliminativism

## Strong Tenet Alignment Patterns

Content supports the tenets through multiple interconnected articles:

**Dualism Support:**
- hard-problem-of-consciousness, explanatory-gap, knowledge-argument
- arguments-for-dualism, arguments-against-materialism
- philosophical-zombies, qualia, inverted-qualia, phenomenal-concepts-strategy

**Minimal Quantum Interaction Support:**
- quantum-consciousness, quantum-neural-mechanisms, stapp-quantum-mind
- brain-specialness-boundary (explains why no psychokinesis)
- conservation-laws-and-mind (addresses energy objection)
- quantum-biology (biological quantum effects as precedent)

**Bidirectional Interaction Support:**
- mental-causation, downward-causation, self-stultification
- consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns, attention-interface-mechanisms
- baseline-cognition (empirical evidence for consciousness's causal role)
- choking-phenomenon-mental-causation (observable evidence)

**No Many Worlds Support:**
- many-worlds (detailed arguments against MWI)
- haecceity, indexical-facts, personal-identity, self-locating-beliefs
- quantum-measurement-interpretations-beyond-mwi (alternatives exist)
- vertiginous-question (indexical identity puzzles)

**Occam's Razor Has Limits Support:**
- The tenets article itself articulates historical counterexamples
- cognitive-closure (simplicity may mask ignorance)
- Multiple articles note that apparent simplicity can mask conceptual poverty
