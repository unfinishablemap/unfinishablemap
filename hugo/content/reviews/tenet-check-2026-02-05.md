# Tenet Alignment Check

**Date**: 2026-02-05
**Files checked**: 233 (164 concepts + 69 topics)
**Errors**: 0
**Warnings**: 0
**Notes**: 0

## Summary

All 233 content files in `obsidian/concepts/` (164 files) and `obsidian/topics/` (69 files) were reviewed for alignment with the five foundational tenets. No violations were found. Articles discussing competing philosophical positions (materialism, illusionism, functionalism, epiphenomenalism, many-worlds interpretation, relational quantum mechanics) consistently frame them as views the Map critiques rather than endorses. The content base remains well-aligned with the tenets.

### The Five Tenets Checked Against

1. **Dualism**: Consciousness is not reducible to physical processes.
   - *Rules out*: Eliminative materialism, reductive physicalism, any view treating consciousness as purely epiphenomenal or illusory.

2. **Minimal Quantum Interaction**: The smallest possible non-physical influence on physical outcomes via quantum indeterminacy.
   - *Rules out*: Quantum woo/mysticism, uncontrolled psychokinesis, energy injection by mind, empirically detectable mind-matter interactions.

3. **Bidirectional Interaction**: Consciousness causally influences the physical world.
   - *Rules out*: Pure epiphenomenalism, parallelism without interaction, views where consciousness is "along for the ride."

4. **No Many Worlds**: The many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics is rejected.
   - *Rules out*: Treating all quantum branches as equally real, dismissing indexical identity as meaningless.

5. **Occam's Razor Has Limits**: Simplicity is not a reliable guide to truth when knowledge is incomplete.
   - *Rules out*: Using parsimony as a decisive argument against dualism, treating Occam's Razor as more than a defeasible heuristic.

## Errors

None.

## Warnings

None.

## Notes

None.

## Key Observations

### New Content Since Last Check

- **dopamine-and-the-unified-interface.md** (new topic): Properly aligned with tenets, exploring dopamine's role in the quantum selection interface while respecting the Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet's constraints.

### Articles on Competing Positions

The following articles discuss philosophical positions that the tenets rule out, but do so appropriately—framing them as positions the Map critiques:

- **materialism.md**: Explains why physicalism fails; core articulation of why the Dualism tenet is adopted
- **illusionism.md**: Treats illusionism as the strongest challenge to the Map's position while presenting comprehensive responses
- **functionalism.md**: Discusses functionalism's challenges from the Map's perspective
- **epiphenomenalism.md**: Explains the self-stultification problem; explicitly notes the tenets reject this view
- **many-worlds.md**: Presents the No Many Worlds tenet's rejection with detailed arguments
- **relational-quantum-mechanics.md**: Explains RQM's direct conflict with Bidirectional Interaction while acknowledging its elegance
- **panpsychism.md**: Treats panpsychism as an alternative to explore while noting tensions with the Map's framework

### Strong Tenet Alignment Patterns

Content supports the tenets through multiple interconnected articles:

**Dualism Support:**
- hard-problem-of-consciousness, explanatory-gap, knowledge-argument
- arguments-for-dualism, arguments-against-materialism
- philosophical-zombies, qualia, inverted-qualia

**Minimal Quantum Interaction Support:**
- quantum-consciousness, quantum-neural-mechanisms, stapp-quantum-mind
- brain-interface-boundary (explains why no psychokinesis)
- conservation-laws-and-mind (addresses energy objection)

**Bidirectional Interaction Support:**
- mental-causation, downward-causation, self-stultification
- neuroplasticity, contemplative-neuroscience
- consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns

**No Many Worlds Support:**
- many-worlds (detailed arguments against MWI)
- haecceity, indexical-facts, personal-identity
- quantum-measurement-interpretations-beyond-mwi (alternatives exist)

**Occam's Razor Has Limits Support:**
- The tenets article itself articulates historical counterexamples
- Multiple articles note that apparent simplicity can mask ignorance
