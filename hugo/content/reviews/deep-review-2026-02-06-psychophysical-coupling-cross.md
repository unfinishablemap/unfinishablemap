**Date**: 2026-02-06
**Article**: [Psychophysical Coupling](/concepts/psychophysical-coupling/)
**Previous review**: [2026-02-06](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-06-psychophysical-coupling/) (earlier same day)
**Cross-review context**: [attention-consciousness-dissociation](/topics/attention-consciousness-dissociation/) (insights from dissociation evidence)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. Previous review resolved all citation and attribution errors.

### Medium Issues Found

- **Attention-consciousness dissociation gap**: Law Family 1 (Attention-Bounded Selection) presented attention as the coupling mechanism without acknowledging the Map's own dissociation evidence showing consciousness can exist without attention (peripheral awareness, gist perception). If coupling operates through attention but consciousness can exist without attention, the article needed to clarify that coupling operates through *directed* attention specifically—the interface mode—not through consciousness as such. **Resolution**: Added "dissociation constraint" paragraph to Law Family 1 explaining that coupling requires active attentional engagement (the interface), while peripheral awareness represents reception without selection.

- **Missing cross-link to dissociation article**: No link to [attention-consciousness-dissociation](/topics/attention-consciousness-dissociation/) despite direct relevance to Law Family 1 and the attention-based coupling mechanism. **Resolution**: Added to Further Reading and added [attention-as-interface](/concepts/attention-as-interface/) to frontmatter concepts.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Eliminative Materialist**: Bedrock disagreement from previous reviews. Not re-flagged.
- **Quantum Skeptic**: Decoherence tensions already qualified per earlier review. Not re-flagged.
- **MWI Defender**: Bedrock disagreement. Not re-flagged.
- **Empiricist**: Testable predictions vague but inherent to early-stage theory. Not re-flagged.
- **Buddhist Philosopher**: Self-subsisting subject assumption beyond scope. Not re-flagged.

## Attribution Accuracy Check

All attributions verified accurate. Previous review corrected Georgiev and Zheng & Meister citations. No new attribution issues found.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Four-family coupling law taxonomy with clear variable specifications
- Specification requirement criteria (precision, mechanism, falsifiability)
- Comparative analysis table with honest development-level grading
- Contemplative evidence section connecting meditation phenomenology to coupling predictions
- Substantive treatment of all five tenets in Relation to Site Perspective
- Bandwidth constraint as empirically grounded limitation

### Enhancements Made

- Added dissociation constraint paragraph to Law Family 1, integrating insights from the attention-consciousness-dissociation article
- Added cross-link to [attention-consciousness-dissociation](/topics/attention-consciousness-dissociation/) in Further Reading
- Added [attention-as-interface](/concepts/attention-as-interface/) to frontmatter concepts
- Compressed Chalmers three principles subsection (detailed treatment available in dedicated [psychophysical-laws](/concepts/psychophysical-laws/) article)
- Tightened Chalmers-McQueen position and bandwidth intro for length neutrality

### Cross-links Added

- [attention-consciousness-dissociation](/topics/attention-consciousness-dissociation/) (Further Reading)
- [attention-as-interface](/concepts/attention-as-interface/) (frontmatter concepts)

## Word Count

- Before: 3311 words (132% of 2500 soft threshold)
- After: 3303 words (132% of 2500 soft threshold)
- Change: -8 words (net reduction despite adding dissociation content, achieved through compression of Chalmers section)

## Remaining Items

- Article remains above soft threshold (132%). The scope as a coalesced concepts article covering law families, mechanisms, challenges, and site perspective justifies the length. Further condensation could target remaining Chalmers framework material (covered in detail by [psychophysical-laws](/concepts/psychophysical-laws/)).

## Stability Notes

- The dissociation constraint is a substantive integration of cross-article insights, not a philosophical disagreement. Future reviews should not re-flag this—it represents the Map's internal coherence between the coupling and dissociation articles.
- All previous stability notes from the earlier 2026-02-06 review remain valid: citation corrections are stable, Schwartz/decoherence caveats are aligned with sibling article, MWI disagreement is bedrock.
- The article has now been reviewed twice today—once for internal accuracy (citations, qualifications) and once for cross-article coherence (dissociation insights). It should be considered stable. Future reviews should focus on whether new Map content creates additional integration opportunities, not on re-examining existing arguments.
