title: Deep Review - Working Memory and Consciousness
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-01-21
**Article**: [Working Memory and Consciousness](/concepts/working-memory/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Missing illusionist engagement**: Article didn't address how illusionists would explain the maintenance/manipulation distinction without invoking consciousness. Resolution: Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section (~400 words) with Frankish's quasi-phenomenal framework and regress/zombie counter-arguments.
- **Missing Process Philosophy section**: Other deep-reviewed articles include Whitehead connections. Resolution: Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section (~300 words) connecting WM operations to prehension, mental/physical poles, and concrescence.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Incomplete tenet coverage**: Only 3 of 5 tenets addressed. Resolution: Expanded Relation to Site Tenets section to cover all five tenets with substantive arguments for each.
- **Missing falsifiability section**: Resolution: Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section (~350 words) with 5 specific conditions that would weaken the Map's interpretation.
- **Missing cross-links to phenomenology-of-choice and metarepresentation**: Resolution: Added links in concepts frontmatter and Further Reading section.
- **Style guide violation**: Used "recent research" instead of specific dates. Resolution: Changed to "Research from 2011-2025".

### Counterarguments Considered
- Illusionist deflation of maintenance/manipulation as mere activation differences
- Quasi-phenomenal properties as alternative to genuine phenomenality
- Computational binding as challenge to quantum/consciousness account

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- The maintenance/manipulation distinction as core organizing principle
- The consciousness-as-amplifier connection with 2±1 vs 7±2 capacity gap
- The specious present connection linking WM to temporal consciousness
- The semantic memory integration with TOT phenomenology
- The "What Working Memory Is Not" clarifications

### Enhancements Made
- Illusionist Challenge section with regress and zombie arguments
- Process Philosophy Perspective connecting Whitehead to WM operations
- Complete five-tenet coverage with substantive arguments
- Falsifiability conditions section
- Cross-links to phenomenology-of-choice and metarepresentation

### Cross-links Added
- [phenomenology-of-choice](/concepts/phenomenology-of-choice/)
- [metarepresentation](/concepts/metacognition/)
- [illusionism](/concepts/illusionism/)
- [philosophical-zombies](/concepts/philosophical-zombies/)
