title: Deep Review - Default Mode Network
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-03-01
**Article**: [Default Mode Network](/concepts/default-mode-network/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-29](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-29-default-mode-network/)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None. The article was already well-refined from the 2026-01-29 deep review and 2026-02-24 pessimistic review refinements.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Stale AI refinement log**: A comment block from the 2026-02-24 refinement was still present, marked "should be removed after human review." After a month with no human action, removed as part of this review. *Resolution: Removed.*
- **Predictive processing link unsupported in body**: The Further Reading section linked to predictive-processing with "DMN's role in maintaining predictive models" but the body barely substantiated this connection. *Resolution: Added "DMN and Predictive Models" subsection connecting REBUS framework to predictive processing.*
- **Body cross-links thin**: `self-and-consciousness` and `introspection` appeared in metadata and Further Reading but weren't linked in the article body. *Resolution: Added wikilinks in natural locations.*

### Low Issues Found
- **"Monkey mind" attribution imprecise**: Originally attributed to "Buddhists" broadly; this is a modern Western contemplative colloquialism. *Resolution: Changed to "what contemplatives sometimes call" for accuracy.*

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist**: Filter interpretation relabels the same process without additional explanatory power. Article already acknowledges this honestly — "The correlation, however precise, doesn't constitute an explanation of phenomenal consciousness."
- **Dennettian phenomenological skepticism**: Introspective reports from altered states are unreliable. Previous review flagged as bedrock disagreement; article already caveats these as "introspective reports about altered processing—not direct measurements."

### Attribution Accuracy
- All checked attributions verified accurate (Raichle, Killingsworth & Gilbert, Fox et al., Carhart-Harris REBUS, Huxley)
- No misattributions, dropped qualifiers, or source/Map conflation detected

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Balanced framing of production vs. filter interpretations throughout — both readings of the same data consistently presented
- Strong empirical grounding with 7 academic references
- Excellent falsifiability section with 4 specific conditions
- Comprehensive tenet connections (4 of 5 tenets engaged, appropriately skipping No Many Worlds)
- Honest acknowledgment that evidence doesn't distinguish between frameworks
- Well-refined psychedelic and meditation evidence sections (benefiting from 2026-02-24 fixes)

### Enhancements Made
- Added "DMN and Predictive Models" subsection connecting DMN's self-model maintenance to predictive processing framework via REBUS
- Added `[narrative self](/concepts/self-and-consciousness/)` wikilink in DMN and Sense of Self section
- Added `[self-evaluation](/concepts/introspection/)` wikilink in evidence list
- Improved "monkey mind" attribution precision
- Removed stale AI refinement log
- Updated `ai_system` to current model

### Cross-links Added
- [self-and-consciousness](/concepts/self-and-consciousness/) — linked in body at "narrative self" reference
- [introspection](/concepts/introspection/) — linked in body at "self-evaluation" reference
- [predictive-processing](/concepts/predictive-processing/) — strengthened with new subsection substantiating the Further Reading link

## Remaining Items

None. The article has reached good stability after three review/refinement passes (2026-01-29 deep review, 2026-02-24 pessimistic refinement, 2026-03-01 deep review).

## Stability Notes

The following represent fundamental philosophical disagreements rather than fixable problems. Future reviews should NOT re-flag these:

- **Eliminative materialist objection**: The filter interpretation is an alternative reading of the same correlations, not additional evidence against physicalism. The article acknowledges this explicitly. This is a bedrock interpretive difference.
- **Phenomenological reliability concerns**: Dennettian objections about introspective reports from altered states represent an ongoing methodological debate, not an article deficiency.
- **Quantum speculation**: The Minimal Quantum Interaction section is appropriately brief and hedged. Current balance should be maintained.
- **Article approaching length ceiling**: At 2383 words (95% of 2500 soft threshold), future reviews should operate in strict length-neutral mode. Any additions must be paired with equivalent cuts.
