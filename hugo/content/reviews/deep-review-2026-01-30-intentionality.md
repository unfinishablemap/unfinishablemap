title: Deep Review - Intentionality
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-01-30
**Article**: [Intentionality](/concepts/intentionality/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-20](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-20-intentionality/)
**Cross-review context**: symbol-grounding-problem.md

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article was well-reviewed in 2026-01-20 and changes since then were minor (SEO descriptions, style updates).

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing symbol-grounding-problem cross-link**: Given the cross-review context, the intentionality article should reference the new symbol-grounding-problem article. Resolution: Added cross-link in Further Reading and integrated brief mention of symbol grounding and dictionary regress in the naturalization section.

### Counterarguments Considered
- All six adversarial personas engaged with the content
- Previous review already addressed illusionist challenge, process philosophy gaps, and falsifiability
- Buddhist critique of unified subject noted as low-priority expansion opportunity (not addressed due to length constraints)

## Attribution Accuracy Check

N/A - This article is not based on a single source requiring attribution verification.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent opening summary with front-loaded key concepts
- Strong connection between intentionality and phenomenal consciousness via PIT
- Clear articulation of Brentano's three aspects (directedness, aspectuality, non-existence)
- Effective concrete examples (Paris, unicorns, Oedipus, Chinese Room)
- Comprehensive tenet connections in Relation to Site Perspective
- Galen Strawson's foreign language argument
- Process philosophy section provides alternative framework
- Five falsifiability conditions show intellectual honesty

### Enhancements Made
- Added cross-link to [symbol-grounding-problem](/concepts/symbol-grounding-problem/) in Further Reading
- Integrated mention of symbol grounding and dictionary regress in naturalization section
- Minor prose tightening in Process Philosophy section for length-neutrality
- Minor prose tightening in AI Consciousness section for length-neutrality

### Cross-links Added
- [symbol-grounding-problem](/concepts/symbol-grounding-problem/)

## Length Management

- Starting word count: 3193 (128% of 2500 soft threshold)
- Final word count: 3216 (129% of 2500 soft threshold)
- Net change: +23 words
- Operated in length-neutral mode with minor prose tightening to offset additions

## Remaining Items

None - the article is in good shape after two reviews.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed twice. The first review (2026-01-20) found no critical issues and added sections on illusionism, process philosophy, falsifiability, and decoherence. This second review (2026-01-30) integrated cross-review insights from the symbol-grounding-problem article.

**Bedrock philosophical disagreements** (not flaws to fix):
- Eliminative materialists will reject PIT's presupposition of phenomenal consciousness
- MWI defenders will find the indexical argument unsatisfying
- These represent expected philosophical standoffs, not article weaknesses

The article has reached stability. Future reviews should focus on:
1. New cross-linking opportunities as related articles are created
2. Any factual claims that become outdated
3. Avoid expanding content further given length constraints
