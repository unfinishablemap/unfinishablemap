title: Deep Review - The Evolutionary Case for Mental Causation
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-05
**Article**: [The Evolutionary Case for Mental Causation](/topics/evolutionary-case-for-mental-causation/)
**Previous review**: Earlier today (04:39 UTC) - first review pass

## Review Context

This is the second review pass, focusing on orphan integration. The first review (04:39 UTC) found no critical issues and addressed medium issues (strengthening the correlation argument). This review focuses on integrating the article into the site navigation through cross-references.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. Article remains factually accurate with properly attributed claims.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Orphan status**: Article had no inbound links. **Resolution**: Added cross-references from 6 related articles.

### Low Issues Found
None new. Previous review noted that quantum mechanisms remain speculative (article already acknowledges this appropriately).

### Counterarguments Considered
All major counterarguments were addressed in the first review pass. No new issues identified.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear three-premise argument structure (consciousness evolved, selection acts on effects, consciousness elaborated)
- William James framing and historical grounding
- Separation of evolutionary argument (establishes causation) from quantum hypothesis (proposes mechanism)
- Honest "What Would Defeat the Argument?" section
- Strong tenet connections in final section

### Enhancements Made
Added cross-references from related articles to integrate this orphan:

### Cross-links Added (from other articles to this one)
- [epiphenomenalism](/arguments/epiphenomenalism/) — Added link in "The Evolutionary Objection" section and Further Reading
- [mental-causation](/concepts/mental-causation/) — Added link in "The Self-Stultification Argument" section and Further Reading
- [consciousness-and-intelligence](/topics/consciousness-and-intelligence/) — Added link in "The Evolutionary Argument" section and Further Reading
- [evolution-of-consciousness](/concepts/evolution-of-consciousness/) — Added link in "The Epiphenomenalist Challenge" section and Further Reading
- [consciousness-as-amplifier](/concepts/consciousness-as-amplifier/) — Added link in "The Evolutionary Argument" section and Further Reading
- [bidirectional-interaction](/concepts/bidirectional-interaction/) — Added link in "Evolutionary Convergence" section and Further Reading

## Remaining Items
None. Article is now well-integrated into the site navigation.

## Stability Notes

The following represent fundamental philosophical disagreements, not fixable flaws (unchanged from first review):
- **Eliminativists** will always object that "consciousness" is not a natural kind—this is a bedrock disagreement about ontology
- **MWI defenders** will resist the argument's implicit collapse framing—accepted given Map tenets
- **Hard-line functionalists** may argue access consciousness is what matters, not phenomenal—the article's focus on phenomenal consciousness is a feature, not a bug
