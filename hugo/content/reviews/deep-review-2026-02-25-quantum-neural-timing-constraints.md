**Date**: 2026-02-25
**Article**: [Quantum Neural Timing Constraints](/topics/quantum-neural-timing-constraints/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-27](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-27-quantum-neural-timing-constraints/)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Vossel 2023 citation fabricated**: The reference "Vossel, S. et al. (2023). Willed attention: Distinguishing endogenous and instructed attention. Frontiers in Psychology, 14, 1023456" does not exist in any academic database. Web searches confirmed Simone Vossel has published on attention but not this specific paper. All claims attributed to it were either already covered by Bengson 2019 or unsourced.
   - **Resolution**: Removed Vossel 2023 from all citations, body text, and reference list. Reworked willed attention section to cite only Bengson et al. (2019).

2. **Bengson 2019 timing misreported**: The article claimed willed attention deploys at ~300ms citing Bengson 2019. The actual paper reports frontal theta power increases at ~500ms post-cue. This error propagated through the timing table, the "280-300ms Decision Window" section heading, and four additional body text references.
   - **Resolution**: Corrected timing to ~500ms throughout. Updated timing table row. Renamed section to "Neural Decision Timing." Revised all references from "280-300ms window" to "200-500ms" range.

3. **"Remarkably close" convergence claim false**: The article argued ~300ms (willed attention) and ~280ms (motor commitment) were "remarkably close" enough to suggest a single selection mechanism. With the corrected ~500ms timing, this convergence does not exist.
   - **Resolution**: Removed convergence claim. Reframed as different stages of the decision process. Preserved premotor theory of attention link with honest "despite differing timescales" qualification.

4. **Duplicate `[decoherence](/concepts/decoherence/)` in concepts frontmatter**: Appeared twice (lines 15 and 19).
   - **Resolution**: Removed duplicate.

5. **Duplicate `[decoherence](/concepts/decoherence/)` in Further Reading**: Two entries with different descriptions.
   - **Resolution**: Removed the second entry ("The physical process of coherence loss"), kept the first ("The decoherence objection and biological precedents").

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Stale AI refinement log**: HTML comment (lines 221-233) from 2026-02-08 stating "should be removed after human review" had been present for ~3 weeks.
   - **Resolution**: Removed.

### Counterarguments Considered

All six adversarial personas engaged:

- **Eliminative Materialist (Churchland)**: Presupposes consciousness as coherent phenomenon. Bedrock disagreement (stable from prior reviews).
- **Hard-Nosed Physicalist (Dennett)**: Post-decoherence selection's reduced empirical content well-acknowledged after Feb 8 revision. Stable.
- **Quantum Skeptic (Tegmark)**: Both positions fairly presented. Empirical question open. Stable.
- **Many-Worlds Defender (Deutsch)**: MWI acknowledged via tenet 4. Stable.
- **Empiricist (Popper)**: The fabricated Vossel citation was the primary empiricist concern — now resolved. Falsification conditions section remains well-structured.
- **Buddhist Philosopher (Nagarjuna)**: Assumes substantive decision-making self. Bedrock disagreement.

### Attribution Accuracy Check

- **Misattribution**: Vossel 2023 — fabricated citation removed (CRITICAL, fixed)
- **Timing misreport**: Bengson 2019 ~300ms → actual ~500ms (CRITICAL, fixed)
- **Qualifier preservation**: Good throughout — "theoretical prediction," "in vitro measurements," "remains debated"
- **Position strength**: Good — uses "proposed," "predicted," cautious framing
- **Source/Map separation**: Strong after Feb 8 revision — post-decoherence selection clearly labeled as metaphysical
- **Self-contradiction**: None detected

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Timing hierarchy table (excellent at-a-glance reference, now factually accurate)
- "Snapshots vs. filming" analogy for Zeno mechanism
- Mechanism-by-mechanism survival analysis structure
- Schurger resolution section (correctly explained and attributed)
- Restructured falsification conditions separating physical mechanisms from metaphysical framework
- Honest post-decoherence selection trade-off acknowledgment
- Stapp orthodox QM vs Orch OR new physics distinction
- Front-loaded opening paragraph

### Enhancements Made

1. Corrected willed attention timing from fabricated ~300ms to verified ~500ms
2. Removed fabricated Vossel 2023 reference
3. Renamed "280-300ms Decision Window" to "Neural Decision Timing" (accurate framing)
4. Updated all body text references from "280-300ms" to "200-500ms" range
5. Reframed motor commitment and willed attention as operating at different decision stages
6. Removed duplicate frontmatter and Further Reading entries
7. Cleaned up stale AI refinement log comment

### Cross-links Added

None needed — existing cross-linking is comprehensive.

## Remaining Items

None. All critical issues resolved in this review.

## Stability Notes

**Convergence status**: The article has been reviewed three times now (2026-01-26, 2026-01-27, 2026-02-25). The first two reviews found no critical issues. This review found critical attribution errors (fabricated citation, misreported timing) introduced in the original AI generation — these were factual errors, not philosophical disagreements.

The following remain bedrock disagreements that future reviews should NOT re-flag:
- Eliminativist objections to consciousness as coherent phenomenon (tenet commitment)
- MWI objections to collapse-dependent timing debate (tenet 4 commitment)
- Quantum skepticism about biological quantum effects (empirical question, both sides presented)
- Post-decoherence selection's reduced empirical content (explicitly acknowledged)

**Perry 2025 verified**: SSRN paper exists (abstract_id=5539838), author and mesoscopic coherent domains claim confirmed.
**Bengson 2019 verified**: Paper exists at Cerebral Cortex 29(7), frontal theta at ~500ms confirmed, bidirectional frontoparietal coherence confirmed.
