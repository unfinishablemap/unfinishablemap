**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

- **Broken wikilink `[Counterfactual-reasoning](/concepts/counterfactual-reasoning/)`**: Capital C mismatch with actual file `counterfactual-reasoning.md`. Fixed to `[Counterfactual reasoning](/concepts/counterfactual-reasoning/)`.
- **Archived link `[voluntary-attention](/voluntary-attention/)`**: File archived to `archive/concepts/voluntary-attention.md`, replaced by `attention-as-interface.md`. Fixed to `[attentional effort](/concepts/attention-as-interface/)`.
- **Kierkegaard attribution looseness**: "Leap of faith" phrasing oversimplified the pseudonymous *Fear and Trembling*. Rewritten to properly attribute through Johannes de Silentio and qualify the sphere (religious vs. mundane).
- **Four uncited references**: James, Kahneman & Tversky, Gigerenzer, Dreyfus listed in References but never cited in text. Resolved by weaving Kahneman/Tversky, Gigerenzer, and Dreyfus into the new metacognitive monitoring engagement section. Replaced James with Simon (now cited for bounded rationality).
- **Description too long (180 chars)**: Exceeded 150-160 char guideline. Shortened to 131 chars.
- **Description/metadata mismatch**: "Human+AI exploration" contradicted `ai_contribution: 100`. Fixed.
- **Missing `last_deep_review` field**: Added to frontmatter.

### Medium Issues Found

- **Weak engagement with computational counterargument**: The article asserted that computation cannot produce deliberative phenomenology without engaging the substantial metacognitive monitoring literature. Resolved by adding a new subsection "The Metacognitive Monitoring Objection" that directly engages Simon, Kahneman & Tversky, Gigerenzer, and Dreyfus before presenting the Map's response.
- **Overlap between "What Deliberative Phenomenology Reveals" and "Relation to Site Perspective"**: Both sections argued similar points. Resolved by restructuring the former to lead with the computational objection and present three condensed positive arguments, while the latter retains tenet-specific connections.
- **Missing cross-link to `[metacognition](/concepts/metacognition/)`**: Now linked inline in the metacognitive monitoring subsection.
- **Missing gloss for "das Man"**: Added inline explanation: "*das Man* ('the They,' the impersonal social norm)".
- **Grammar: "determined or fully-informed decision"**: Fixed to "decision-making".
- **Missing cross-links to related content**: Added `[subjective-aim](/concepts/subjective-aim/)`, `[temporal-thickness](/concepts/temporal-thickness/)`, `[spontaneous-intentional-action](/concepts/spontaneous-intentional-action/)` to frontmatter, body text, and Further Reading.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Metacognitive monitoring as computation**: Directly addressed in new subsection. Map's response: functional self-monitoring does not entail phenomenal self-awareness; the explanatory gap persists at the metacognitive level.
- **Heuristics-and-biases framework**: Now cited (Kahneman & Tversky, Gigerenzer) and acknowledged as providing computational frameworks for aspects of uncertain decision-making, while arguing they fail to explain phenomenal character.
- **Satisficing/bounded rationality**: Simon now cited; bounded rationality acknowledged as describing the computational side while the phenomenological side remains unexplained.
- **Epiphenomenalist common-cause response**: Addressed in "Estimation does causal work" — if phenomenology is eliminable without affecting performance, expert testimony that practitioners *rely on* felt sense resists this prediction.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Three-tier phenomenological taxonomy (risk / ambiguity / deep uncertainty) — the article's structural backbone
- "Deliberative vertigo" as a named phenomenal state filling a genuine vocabulary gap
- Estimation as phenomenal achievement with three sub-categories
- Opening paragraph's front-loaded thesis
- All five tenet connections in Relation to Site Perspective
- Knight risk/uncertainty distinction as organizing principle
- Cross-reference to probability-intuition-void

### Enhancements Made

- Added engagement with metacognitive monitoring objection (strongest computational alternative)
- Added self-forming dimension to "Uncertainty and Authentic Choice" section — decisions under uncertainty constitute the self
- Added process-philosophical grounding via `[subjective-aim](/concepts/subjective-aim/)` for the commitment concept
- Added `[temporal-thickness](/concepts/temporal-thickness/)` connection for the experiential density of uncertain deliberation
- Added `[spontaneous-intentional-action](/concepts/spontaneous-intentional-action/)` as complement (commitment without extended deliberation)
- Restructured "What Deliberative Phenomenology Reveals" into objection-then-response format
- Cited previously uncited references (Dreyfus, Gigerenzer, Kahneman & Tversky) and added Simon

### Cross-links Added

- [metacognition](/concepts/metacognition/) (inline, body text)
- [subjective-aim](/concepts/subjective-aim/) (frontmatter concepts, body text, Further Reading)
- [temporal-thickness](/concepts/temporal-thickness/) (frontmatter concepts, body text, Further Reading)
- [spontaneous-intentional-action](/concepts/spontaneous-intentional-action/) (frontmatter related_articles, Further Reading)
- [attention-as-interface](/concepts/attention-as-interface/) (replaced archived [voluntary-attention](/voluntary-attention/))

## Remaining Items

- The MWI tenet connection could be strengthened to engage with the indexical objection (MWI proponent would argue that from any branch's perspective, commitment is still real). Deferred as medium-priority — the current argument is defensible if slightly simplified.
- The article could benefit from a "What Would Challenge This View?" section. Deferred — article is at 85% of soft threshold and this would push toward or past the limit.

## Stability Notes

- The adversarial personas (especially Dennett and Churchland) will always find the phenomenology-as-evidence strategy unconvincing. This is a bedrock methodological disagreement, not a flaw to fix. The article cannot satisfy eliminativists without abandoning phenomenological methodology.
- The MWI defender's objection about indexical experience under branching is a genuine philosophical tension, not a decisive refutation. The current simplified treatment is acceptable.
- The empiricist's demand for falsifiable predictions targets the Map's methodology broadly, not this article specifically. Future reviews should not re-flag this as critical.
