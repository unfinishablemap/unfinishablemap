# Deep Review: Mysterianism and Cognitive Closure

**Date**: 2026-01-29
**File**: obsidian/concepts/mysterianism.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-28
**Cross-review context**: origin-of-consciousness.md (the origin void)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article remains in excellent shape from previous reviews.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing bidirectional link to origin-of-consciousness.md**: The new voids article explicitly invokes McGinn's cognitive closure and discusses the origin question as "prior" to the hard problem. A cross-link strengthens both articles. **Resolution**: Added link in frontmatter, Further Reading, and a sentence in "Problems Versus Mysteries" connecting the origin void to mysterian cognitive closure.

### Low Issues Found
None.

### Attribution Check
- McGinn's cognitive closure (1989): ✓ Correct
- Chomsky's problems vs. mysteries: ✓ Correct
- Nagel's bat argument: ✓ Correct
- Fodor's concept nativism: ✓ Correct
- All attributions verified accurate.

### Counterarguments Considered
All six adversarial personas engaged:
- **Eliminative Materialist**: Bedrock disagreement (phenomenal consciousness may be confused concept)—not re-flagged
- **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: Defeatism objection adequately addressed (lines 159-163)
- **Quantum Skeptic**: Penrose treated appropriately as evidence, not proof
- **Many-Worlds Defender**: Brief but adequate treatment (lines 188-189)
- **Empiricist**: Falsifiability section excellent (lines 146-154)
- **Buddhist Philosopher**: Bedrock disagreement (substantialist framework)—not re-flagged

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear opening paragraph stating cognitive closure thesis immediately
- Excellent C. elegans empirical example
- Strong "Phenomenology of Cognitive Closure" section connecting theory to experience
- Comprehensive tenet coverage with specific connections to all five tenets
- Good falsifiability conditions in "What Would Challenge This View?"
- Well-integrated with computational-cognitive-limits and convergent-cognitive-limits

### Enhancements Made
1. **Added cross-link** to [origin-of-consciousness](/voids/origin-of-consciousness/) in frontmatter and Further Reading
2. **Added one sentence** in "Problems Versus Mysteries" connecting the hard problem to the prior origin question, noting that mysterian cognitive closure may explain both
3. **Tightened prose** in "Cognitive Closure" section (removed redundant rat example) to offset additions (length-neutral mode)

### Cross-links Added
- [origin-of-consciousness](/voids/origin-of-consciousness/) — The prior question: why consciousness exists at all

## Word Count
- Before: 2597 words (104% of 2500 soft threshold)
- After: 2603 words (104% of 2500 soft threshold)
- Net change: +6 words (essentially length-neutral due to prose tightening)

## Remaining Items

None. Article now has bidirectional link to origin-of-consciousness.md.

## Stability Notes

This is the **fifth deep review** of this article (2026-01-20, 2026-01-27 twice, 2026-01-28, this review). Key stability markers:

1. **Bedrock disagreements (do not re-flag)**:
   - Eliminativists will always question whether "phenomenal consciousness" is coherent
   - Buddhist philosophers will question the substantialist framework
   - These represent philosophical standoffs, not article flaws

2. **Convergence achieved**:
   - 2026-01-20: Added illusionism, process philosophy, falsifiability, full tenets
   - 2026-01-27: Added intrinsic nature connection, computational limits distinction
   - 2026-01-28: Added bidirectional link to convergent-cognitive-limits
   - 2026-01-29: Added bidirectional link to origin-of-consciousness (origin void)

3. **Article is at stability**:
   - All major philosophical positions engaged
   - All tenets covered with specific connections
   - Cross-linked to: computational-cognitive-limits, convergent-cognitive-limits, origin-of-consciousness, intrinsic-nature-void, and other relevant voids content
   - Word count at threshold—further additions require equivalent cuts
   - Future reviews should only address: new related content, significant literature developments, or broken links

The origin void cross-link was the right addition: it creates a natural conceptual link between the hard problem (what mysterianism addresses) and the prior origin question (why consciousness exists at all), with McGinn's cognitive closure potentially explaining both.
