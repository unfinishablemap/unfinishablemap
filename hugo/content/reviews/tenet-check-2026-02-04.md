# Tenet Alignment Check

**Date**: 2026-02-04
**Files checked**: 232 (164 concepts + 68 topics)
**Errors**: 0
**Warnings**: 0
**Notes**: 0

## Summary

All 232 content files in `obsidian/concepts/` (164 files) and `obsidian/topics/` (68 files) were reviewed for alignment with the five foundational tenets. No violations were found. Articles discussing competing philosophical positions (materialism, illusionism, functionalism, epiphenomenalism, many-worlds interpretation, panpsychism) consistently frame them as views the Map critiques rather than endorses. Most files include explicit "Relation to Site Perspective" sections connecting content to specific tenets.

### The Five Tenets Checked Against

1. **Dualism**: Consciousness is not reducible to physical processes.
   - *Rules out*: Eliminative materialism, reductive physicalism, any view treating consciousness as purely epiphenomenal or illusory.

2. **Minimal Quantum Interaction**: The smallest possible non-physical influence on physical outcomes via quantum indeterminacy.
   - *Rules out*: Quantum woo/mysticism, uncontrolled psychokinesis, energy injection by mind, empirically detectable mind-matter interactions.

3. **Bidirectional Interaction**: Consciousness causally influences the physical world.
   - *Rules out*: Pure epiphenomenalism, parallelism without interaction, views where consciousness is "along for the ride."

4. **No Many Worlds**: The many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics is rejected.
   - *Rules out*: Treating all quantum branches as equally real, dismissing indexical identity as meaningless.

5. **Occam's Razor Has Limits**: Simplicity is not a reliable guide to truth when knowledge is incomplete.
   - *Rules out*: Using parsimony as a decisive argument against dualism, treating Occam's Razor as more than a defeasible heuristic.

## Errors

None.

## Warnings

None.

## Notes

None.

## Key Observations

### Articles on Competing Positions

The following articles discuss philosophical positions that the tenets rule out, but do so appropriately—framing them as positions the Map critiques:

- **materialism.md**: Explains why physicalism fails; core articulation of why the Dualism tenet is adopted
- **illusionism.md**: Treats illusionism as the strongest challenge to the Map's position while presenting comprehensive responses
- **functionalism.md**: Discusses functionalism's challenges from the Map's perspective
- **epiphenomenalism.md**: Explains the self-stultification problem; explicitly notes the tenets reject this view
- **many-worlds.md**: Presents the No Many Worlds tenet's rejection with detailed arguments
- **panpsychism.md**: Treats panpsychism as an alternative to explore while noting tensions with the Map's framework

### Strong Tenet Alignment Patterns

- Articles on **neuroplasticity**, **contemplative-neuroscience**, and **stapp-quantum-mind** provide empirical support for Bidirectional Interaction
- Articles on **emergence**, **mental-causation**, and **downward-causation** develop the theoretical framework for mind-matter interaction
- Articles on **self-stultification**, **argument-from-reason**, and **reasons-responsiveness** provide argumentative support against epiphenomenalism
- Articles on **indexical-facts**, **self-locating-beliefs**, and **haecceity** support the No Many Worlds tenet
- Articles on **hard-problem-of-consciousness**, **explanatory-gap**, and **knowledge-argument** support the Dualism tenet
