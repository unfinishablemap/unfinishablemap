# Tenet Alignment Check

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Scope**: obsidian/concepts/ (165 files) and obsidian/topics/ (71 files)
**Total files checked**: 236
**Errors**: 0
**Warnings**: 0
**Notes**: 8

## Summary

All 236 content files were analyzed against the five foundational tenets. The collection is in strong alignment. No file endorses or assumes positions that contradict the tenets. Eight minor notes identify phrasing or framing that could be read as tension, though all occur in articles that explicitly support the tenets elsewhere in their text.

The content consistently:
- Treats consciousness as irreducible to physical processes (Tenet 1: Dualism)
- Proposes minimal quantum interaction without quantum mysticism (Tenet 2: Minimal Quantum Interaction)
- Maintains that consciousness causally influences the physical world (Tenet 3: Bidirectional Interaction)
- Rejects the Many-Worlds Interpretation and values indexical identity (Tenet 4: No Many Worlds)
- Applies appropriate skepticism toward parsimony arguments against dualism (Tenet 5: Occam's Razor Has Limits)

Opposing views (materialism, illusionism, functionalism, panpsychism, epiphenomenalism, MWI, analytic idealism, Russellian monism, IIT, GWT, HOT, AST, heterophenomenology) are discussed throughout as positions to be examined and critiqued, not endorsed. Each file presenting an opposing view does so in the context of evaluating it against the Map's framework. This is expected and appropriate in philosophical writing.

## Errors

None.

## Warnings

None.

## Notes

### 1. simulation.md
- **Tenet**: Tenet 1 (Dualism)
- **Phrasing**: "This has implications for ai-consciousness: if we're simulated and conscious, digital systems might also achieve consciousness under the right conditions. The barrier would be architectural, not substrate-based."
- **Observation**: This sentence could be read as suggesting substrate independence of consciousness, which would conflict with the Map's rejection of functionalism. However, the article frames this as a conditional implication within the simulation hypothesis, not the Map's own position. The "Relation to Site Perspective" section explicitly connects to all five tenets. No change required, but worth noting.

### 2. counterfactual-reasoning.md
- **Tenet**: Tenet 1 (Dualism) / Tenet 3 (Bidirectional Interaction)
- **Phrasing**: "The Map acknowledges LLMs as a genuine challenge case where theoretical predictions are unclear. If LLMs demonstrate increasingly sophisticated counterfactual capacities without consciousness, this would pressure the strong necessity claim."
- **Observation**: The article leaves open the possibility that some consciousness-linked capacities might be achievable without consciousness. This is intellectually honest and does not contradict the tenets but introduces uncertainty for the dualism connection. No change required; the article handles this tension with appropriate nuance.

### 3. neurophenomenology.md
- **Tenet**: Tenet 1 (Dualism)
- **Phrasing**: "The Map appropriates Buddhist contemplative practice while noting the phenomenological data don't uniquely support substance dualism; they're compatible with process philosophy, neutral monism, or Buddhist anti-substantialism."
- **Observation**: The article acknowledges tension between the Map's use of Buddhist contemplative evidence and Buddhist metaphysics (*anatman* denies enduring conscious substance). The article handles this transparently by clarifying the Map's dualism commits to irreducibility, not to an enduring Cartesian substance. No change needed, but the gap between appropriating Buddhist methods and rejecting Buddhist metaphysical conclusions should be monitored as more contemplative content is added.

### 4. integrated-information-theory.md
- **Tenet**: Tenet 1 (Dualism) / Tenet 3 (Bidirectional Interaction)
- **Phrasing**: IIT is framed as a "partial ally" that "takes consciousness seriously as a fundamental feature of reality."
- **Observation**: IIT's identity thesis (consciousness IS integrated information) is a form of property physicalism that the Map's dualism tenet rules out. The article does flag the conflict, but the "partial ally" framing may understate the depth of disagreement. No change needed; the article's "Relation to Site Perspective" section maintains critical distance.

### 5. global-workspace-theory.md
- **Tenet**: Tenet 1 (Dualism)
- **Phrasing**: GWT is positioned as describing "necessary conditions for consciousness without being sufficient for it."
- **Observation**: GWT is typically understood by its proponents (Baars, Dehaene) as a physicalist theory. The article's generous interpretation -- that GWT describes the workspace consciousness uses rather than explaining consciousness itself -- is the Map's reinterpretation, not GWT proponents' self-understanding. No change needed; the reinterpretation is transparent and clearly marked.

### 6. loss-of-consciousness.md (topics)
- **Tenet**: Tenet 2 (Minimal Quantum Interaction)
- **Phrasing**: "This suggests the brain *prepares* for consciousness rather than *producing* it—as if neural structures orient themselves to receive something that comes from elsewhere."
- **Observation**: The filter theory language ("receive something that comes from elsewhere") goes somewhat beyond the Map's standard Minimal Quantum Interaction framing toward a stronger ontological claim about consciousness existing in some realm separate from its physical interface. Compatible with dualism but could be read as stronger than what the tenets explicitly claim. No change required.

### 7. william-james-consciousness.md (topics)
- **Tenet**: Tenet 1 (Dualism)
- **Phrasing**: "there is only one primal stuff or material in the world, a stuff of which everything is composed, and if we call that stuff 'pure experience'"
- **Observation**: James's radical empiricism / neutral monism is presented with genuine intellectual sympathy. The article notes James "rejected consciousness as a separate entity or substance" and proposed "pure experience" as fundamental. The article acknowledges the tension with the Map's dualism ("James's pure experience doctrine sits uneasily with his filter theory") and frames the discussion as examining a historical figure's philosophy, not endorsing neutral monism. No change required.

### 8. quantum-measurement-and-subjective-probability.md (topics)
- **Tenet**: Tenet 2 (Minimal Quantum Interaction)
- **Phrasing**: "Decoherence presents a particular challenge: quantum superpositions in warm biological systems collapse in ~10^-13 seconds through environmental interaction alone—far too fast for consciousness to play a role through ordinary neural processes."
- **Observation**: States the Tegmark femtosecond decoherence estimate as though settled fact within the consciousness-collapse section, whereas other Map articles consistently treat this figure as disputed (Hameroff's group challenged Tegmark's assumptions, yielding estimates seven orders of magnitude longer). Minor internal consistency issue rather than a tenet conflict.

## Detailed Analysis by Tenet

### Tenet 1: Dualism

All 165 concept files respect the irreducibility of consciousness to physical processes. Files discussing physicalist, materialist, or functionalist positions (materialism.md, illusionism.md, heterophenomenology.md, attention-schema-theory.md, higher-order-theories.md, phenomenal-concepts-strategy.md, functionalism.md, russellian-monism.md, llm-consciousness.md, reductionism.md, predictive-processing.md) present these as positions to critique, not endorse. Each includes arguments for why these positions fail and connects to the Map's dualist framework.

Files presenting alternative non-physicalist positions (analytic-idealism.md, idealism.md, russellian-monism.md, panpsychism.md, mysterianism.md) clearly state why the Map prefers explicit dualism over these alternatives while acknowledging shared ground. The dualism.md article directly defines and defends the tenet. Mind-brain-separation.md, filter-theory.md, witness-consciousness.md, arguments-for-dualism.md, and arguments-against-materialism.md provide additional support through different argumentative routes.

Files discussing cognitive science perspectives (embodied-cognition.md, intuitive-dualism.md, baseline-cognition.md, blindsight.md, access-consciousness.md) carefully distinguish between Cartesian substance dualism (which embodied cognition challenges) and property dualism (which remains compatible with embodied cognition findings). The phenomenological tradition embedded in these files (Merleau-Ponty, Husserl, Varela) actually supports irreducibility of experience.

Topics files uniformly frame the Map's dualist commitment as their grounding perspective, connecting specific phenomena (choking, loss of consciousness, dreams, split-brain cases, Eastern philosophy) to the irreducibility thesis.

### Tenet 2: Minimal Quantum Interaction

Files discussing quantum mechanisms (quantum-decoherence-objection.md, quantum-neural-mechanisms.md, quantum-biology.md, quantum-binding-experimental-evidence.md, quantum-indeterminacy-free-will.md, quantum-consciousness.md, stapp-quantum-mind.md, neural-quantum-coherence.md, psychophysical-coupling.md, selection-laws.md, prebiotic-collapse.md, spontaneous-collapse-theories.md, measurement-problem.md, collapse-and-time.md, time-symmetric-physics.md, coupling-modes.md, quantum-coherence-protection.md, decoherence.md, consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns.md, attention-motor-quantum-interface.md, dopamine-selection-interface.md) consistently frame quantum consciousness proposals as minimal, constrained hypotheses without energy injection or conservation law violations. No file veers into quantum mysticism. Stapp-quantum-mind.md and selection-laws.md explicitly develop mechanisms that respect conservation constraints. Spontaneous-collapse-theories.md properly notes where Penrose OR's panpsychism aspects conflict with the MQI tenet. Causal-closure.md provides the detailed argument for why quantum indeterminacy creates genuine openings for mental causation.

Topics files covering quantum themes (quantum-neural-timing-constraints.md, quantum-biology-and-the-consciousness-debate.md, quantum-measurement-and-subjective-probability.md, quantum-measurement-interpretations-beyond-mwi.md, quantum-binding-and-phenomenal-unity.md, conservation-laws-and-mind.md, neural-implementation-specifics.md, decoherence-and-macroscopic-superposition.md) maintain the same disciplined framing.

### Tenet 3: Bidirectional Interaction

All files maintain that consciousness causally influences the physical world. No file endorses epiphenomenalism. Files that discuss epiphenomenalism (epiphenomenalism.md, neuroplasticity.md, libet-experiments.md, observational-closure.md, objections-to-interactionism.md, selection-laws.md, psychophysical-laws.md, mental-causation.md, downward-causation.md, self-stultification.md, bidirectional-interaction.md) explicitly argue against it. Neuroplasticity.md provides particularly strong empirical support through Schwartz's OCD research. Attention-as-interface.md specifies the downward direction of bidirectional interaction. Libet-experiments.md addresses the timing challenge through retrocausal and Zeno mechanisms.

The newly checked files strengthen this tenet substantially. Embodied-cognition.md presents choking under pressure as direct evidence for bidirectional interaction. Consciousness-as-amplifier.md argues the human-ape intelligence gap is inexplicable under epiphenomenalism. Evolution-of-consciousness.md shows that the systematic tracking between consciousness and adaptive behavior requires causal connection.

Topics files (choking-phenomenon-mental-causation.md, evolutionary-case-for-mental-causation.md, delegatory-dualism.md, time-collapse-and-agency.md) provide additional evidence streams.

### Tenet 4: No Many Worlds

Files referencing quantum interpretations consistently reject MWI. Many-worlds.md provides the most comprehensive treatment with five arguments against MWI. Collapse-and-time.md has an entire section ("Why Many-Worlds Avoids the Question") arguing against MWI. Time-symmetric-physics.md contrasts time-symmetric interpretations (which preserve real collapse) with MWI (which denies it). Indexical-facts.md, haecceity.md, quantum-interpretations.md, self-locating-beliefs.md, and selection-laws.md all explicitly argue for the importance of indexical identity and against many-worlds branching. Downward-causation.md explains that MWI would eliminate the quantum opening required for consciousness to exercise causal power.

Topics files (vertiginous-question.md, quantum-measurement-interpretations-beyond-mwi.md, indexical-identity-quantum-measurement.md) reinforce the rejection from multiple angles.

### Tenet 5: Occam's Razor Has Limits

Multiple files invoke this tenet to resist parsimony-based dismissals of dualism. Philosophy-of-time.md argues that "simpler metaphysics achieve parsimony by denying phenomena rather than explaining them." Neurophenomenology.md argues that "dismissing two millennia of systematic first-person research as 'merely subjective' isn't parsimony -- it's methodological blindness." Neuroplasticity.md notes that materialist simplicity "purchases simplicity by ignoring the phenomenology." Materialism.md addresses parsimony directly in its "Relation to the Map's Perspective" section. Process-philosophy.md notes that Whitehead's elaborate framework sometimes captures reality better than apparently simpler alternatives. Substrate-independence.md cautions against treating functionalist simplicity as a guide to truth. The pattern is consistent across the collection.

Topics files (epistemic-advantages-of-dualism.md, cognitive-science-of-dualism.md) develop the anti-parsimony argument further.
