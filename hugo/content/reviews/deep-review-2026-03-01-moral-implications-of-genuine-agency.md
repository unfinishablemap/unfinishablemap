title: Deep Review - Moral Implications of Genuine Agency
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-03-01
**Article**: [Moral Implications of Genuine Agency](/topics/moral-implications-of-genuine-agency/)
**Previous review**: [2026-02-27](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-27-moral-implications-of-genuine-agency/)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None. The article has been stable across three reviews. All attributions verified, no factual errors, no style guide violations.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Insufficient cross-referencing**: Despite the previous review adding 10 inbound links, 8 additional closely related articles lacked cross-references. Resolution: added 8 new inbound links (see below).

### Counterarguments Considered
- All six adversarial personas engaged. No new counterarguments beyond those addressed in the 2026-02-23 and 2026-02-27 reviews. Bedrock philosophical disagreements (eliminative materialism, hard determinism, MWI) remain expected standoffs, not fixable problems.

### Attribution Accuracy Check
All attributions verified:
- d'Holbach (System of Nature, 1770): correct
- Pereboom (Living Without Free Will, 2001): correct
- Sartre "condemned to be free" (Being and Nothingness): correct
- "Ought implies can" hedged as "commonly attributed to Kant": correct
- Frankfurt's hierarchical desires: correct
- Fischer and Ravizza's guidance control: correct
- Wolf's Reason View: correct (fixed in 2026-02-27 review)
- Nagel's four-category moral luck taxonomy (1979): correct
- Williams on moral luck (1981): correct
- Aristotle's hexis (NE Book II): correct
- Mackie's queerness argument (1977): correct

No attribution errors found.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening framing connecting genuine agency to "responses to facts about what conscious beings actually do"
- "Peculiar consolation" of determinism passage
- Nagel moral luck taxonomy with precise elimination of fourth category
- "The 'ought' has a real addressee" formulation
- Aristotle/hexis integration with Map's metaphysical backing
- Three-part moral theory demands structure (error theory, consequentialism, virtue ethics)
- Comprehensive Relation to Site Perspective (all five tenets substantively engaged)
- Institutional implications as novel contribution
- Compatibilism engagement (Frankfurt, Fischer/Ravizza, Wolf)
- Buddhist moral philosophy acknowledgment
- Falsifiability section

### Enhancements Made
- No content changes to the article itself (stable)
- Added 8 new inbound cross-references from related articles

## Remaining Items

None. The article is stable and well-integrated.

## Stability Notes

- The article has reached full stability after three reviews. No critical or medium content issues have been found in the last two reviews.
- All six adversarial personas' disagreements are bedrock philosophical standoffs documented in the 2026-02-23 review. Future reviews should NOT re-flag these.
- The compatibilism engagement is adequate (Frankfurt, Fischer/Ravizza, Wolf's Reason View).
- The phenomenological claim about moral seriousness is honestly qualified in the falsifiability section.
- The previous "orphan" status is fully resolved with 18 inbound links from content articles.
- Future reviews should focus on detecting any new factual claims or attribution issues introduced by content changes, not on re-engaging settled philosophical disagreements.
