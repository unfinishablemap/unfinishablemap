# Deep Review: Thoughts That Slip Away

**Date**: 2026-01-29
**File**: obsidian/voids/thoughts-that-slip-away.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-20
**Cross-review context**: attention-created-voids research

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The previous review (2026-01-20) addressed the major structural gaps—adding the Illusionist Challenge section, What Would Challenge This View? section, and comprehensive tenet connections.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Missing connection to attention-created voids research**: The article catalogued slippage as something that *happens to* thoughts but didn't address whether slippage is *produced by* attention itself.
   - **Resolution**: Added "Attention-Produced Slippage" subsection integrating James's fringes, Gurwitsch's field theory, and penumbral suppression research.

2. **Missing attention concept link**: The article discussed attention-related mechanisms without linking to the attention concept.
   - **Resolution**: Added [attention](/concepts/attention/) to concepts in frontmatter.

### Low Issues Found

1. **Quantum speculation remains floating**: The decoherence connection in the tenet section is speculative without engagement.
   - **Resolution**: Deferred—appropriately hedged and not central to the article's argument.

2. **MWI tenet connection is weakest**: The indexical argument doesn't definitively rule out MWI.
   - **Resolution**: Deferred—this is a bedrock philosophical disagreement, not a flaw to fix.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Churchland's eliminativism**: "Noesis" (felt knowing) is unreliable evidence. Acknowledged implicitly in the illusionist section; the article doesn't claim felt knowledge is infallible, only that the phenomenology warrants investigation.

- **Dennett's heterophenomenology**: The three responses to illusionism could be stronger. Deferred—the responses are adequate for a voids article, which aims to map territory rather than definitively resolve debates.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Strong opening paragraph establishing scope and core question
- Well-catalogued slippage mechanisms with scientific grounding (tip-of-tongue, dream forgetting, semantic satiation, ironic suppression, double concealment)
- "What Would Challenge This View?" section with five falsifiability conditions
- Comprehensive tenet connections covering all five tenets
- Illusionist Challenge section with three-part response
- Good cross-linking in Further Reading

### Enhancements Made

1. **Attention-Produced Slippage subsection**: New content integrating insights from attention-created-voids research:
   - Penumbral suppression: attention actively darkens its surround
   - James's fringes: structurally non-focal content
   - Gurwitsch's field theory: marginal contents cannot become thematic
   - Reframes some slippage as structural necessity rather than passive failure

2. **Added attention concept to frontmatter**: Enables proper cross-linking in the Map's concept network.

### Cross-links Added

- [attention](/concepts/attention/) (new concept link)

## Word Count

- Before: 1547 words (77% of 2000 soft threshold)
- After: 1698 words (85% of 2000 soft threshold)
- Change: +151 words

## Remaining Items

None. The article is well-developed with appropriate:
- Scientific grounding for ordinary mechanisms
- Philosophical engagement with counterpositions
- Falsifiability conditions
- Tenet connections
- Cross-links

## Stability Notes

This article has reached stability after two reviews. Key philosophical disagreements that should NOT be re-flagged:

1. **Illusionist objection**: The article engages illusionism but does not "defeat" it—this is a bedrock disagreement in philosophy of mind, not a gap to fill.

2. **MWI connection**: The indexical phenomenology argument doesn't logically exclude MWI—but the Map's commitment to No Many Worlds means we note the phenomenological data that MWI must explain away.

3. **Quantum speculation**: The decoherence connection is explicitly marked as speculative. Future reviews should not demand either stronger endorsement or removal—the current hedging is appropriate.

The addition of attention-produced slippage represents genuine new integration from research conducted after the first review. Future reviews should focus on external developments (new research, new counterarguments) rather than re-litigating the same philosophical tensions.
