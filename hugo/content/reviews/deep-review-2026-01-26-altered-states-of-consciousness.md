# Deep Review: Altered States of Consciousness

**Date**: 2026-01-26
**File**: obsidian/concepts/altered-states-of-consciousness.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-19

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The article is in good condition following the previous deep review. The modifications since 2026-01-19 were minor and did not introduce critical problems.

### Medium Issues Found

- **Unverified citation (ALBUS 2025)**: The article referenced "ALBUS extension (Altered Beliefs Under Psychedelics) connects this to predictive processing frameworks" without proper citation. Resolution: Removed unverified claim; REBUS model alone is sufficient and has proper citation.

- **Vague empirical claim**: "Controlled studies increasingly support" genuine filter-loosening was too vague. Resolution: Replaced with specific reference to clinical psilocybin-assisted therapy studies showing correlation between mystical-type experiences and lasting therapeutic improvements.

- **Introspection reliability concern**: The article didn't acknowledge that psychedelics disrupt the neural processes required for accurate introspection. Resolution: Added explicit acknowledgment of this deeper materialist objection before the response.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Dennett-style functionalist objection to "unfiltered consciousness"**: The boundary states section interprets meditators as accessing consciousness "stripped of normal filtering." From a functionalist perspective, they're simply modifying information processing states. This is a philosophical standoff, not a fixable flaw—the interpretation depends on prior commitments about consciousness.

- **Phenomenology doesn't determine physics**: The MWI defense that altered states "feeling like" one consciousness doesn't prove MWI false. Acknowledged as thin argument in previous review; represents bedrock disagreement.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Clear filter theory framing throughout the opening paragraph
- Effective propofol/ketamine divergence argument
- Well-integrated Tart's taxonomy with thalamic research
- Appropriate hedging on Orch OR/quantum claims
- Substantive "Relation to Site Perspective" section connecting to all relevant tenets
- Boundary States section providing genuine philosophical integration between ASCs and minimal consciousness

### Enhancements Made

- **Added qualia cross-link**: Natural link in opening paragraph connecting "qualitative deviation" to qualia concept
- **Added mysterianism and qualia to related_articles**: Expands connection to site's philosophical framework
- **Strengthened confabulation response**: Added acknowledgment of introspection reliability objection and specific clinical evidence (psilocybin therapy correlation with lasting improvements)
- **Removed unverified ALBUS citation**: Cleaned up reference to speculative extension without proper citation

### Cross-links Added

- [qualia](/concepts/qualia/) — added to related_articles and inline link in opening
- [mysterianism](/concepts/mysterianism/) — added to related_articles

## Word Count

Before: 1778 words (71% of 2500 soft threshold)
After: 1812 words (72% of 2500 soft threshold)

Change: +34 words. Article remains well under threshold.

## Remaining Items

None. All medium-priority issues addressed. Low-priority refinements would be marginal and risk over-editing stable content.

## Stability Notes

This article has now received two deep reviews (2026-01-19 and 2026-01-26). It is approaching stability:

- **Philosophical disagreements that are bedrock, not fixable:**
  - MWI defenders will always find the phenomenological argument weak—this reflects the disagreement between phenomenology and physics, not a flaw in the article
  - Functionalists will interpret meditation states as modified information processing rather than "unfiltered consciousness"—this is interpretive, not factual

- **Areas that could expand indefinitely but shouldn't:**
  - More quantum mechanism detail (already appropriately hedged)
  - More meditation traditions (tantric yoga is mentioned; could add Zen, Sufism, etc. but diminishing returns)
  - More NDE cases (would duplicate near-death-experiences article)

Future reviews finding no critical issues should be considered a success indicating the article has reached a stable, quality state.
