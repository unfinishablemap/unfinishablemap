title: Deep Review - Consciousness and Collective Intentionality
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-19
**Article**: [Consciousness and Collective Intentionality](/topics/consciousness-and-collective-intentionality/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Broken `[metarepresentation](/metarepresentation/)` wikilinks**: The concept page `obsidian/concepts/metarepresentation.md` does not exist. Two inline links pointed to it. **Resolution**: Replaced first occurrence with plain text "metarepresentational" plus parenthetical explanation linking to `[theory-of-mind](/concepts/theory-of-mind/)`; replaced second occurrence with plain text "metarepresentation" without wikilink.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Bratman's conditions inaccurately formulated**: The original text presented a hybrid of Bratman's three characterizing features of shared cooperative activity and his formal sufficient conditions for shared intention, as if they were a single formulation. **Resolution**: Corrected to present the three features (mutual responsiveness, commitment to joint activity, commitment to mutual support) followed by the formal conditions (interlocking intentions, meshing subplans).
- **Functionalist response to normativity argument not engaged**: The article asserted that removing consciousness collapses normative structure without addressing the functionalist objection that normative responses can be characterised by functional roles alone. **Resolution**: Added a paragraph engaging with this objection and presenting the Map's reply (functional accounts capture structure but lose force).
- **`baseline-cognition` in frontmatter but not in body**: The concept was listed in frontmatter concepts but never referenced in the article text. **Resolution**: Removed from frontmatter.
- **`[consciousness-and-interpersonal-understanding](/topics/consciousness-and-interpersonal-understanding/)` only in Further Reading**: This related article was not cross-linked in the body despite its direct relevance. **Resolution**: Added inline cross-link in the promise-representation paragraph.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist**: The phenomenal intentionality thesis is assumed rather than defended. Noted but not flagged — the article relies on the thesis as a well-articulated position within the Map's framework, linking to the concept page.
- **Functionalist normativity**: Addressed — new paragraph engages directly with this objection.
- **Empiricist falsifiability**: The article's "open question" regarding AI institutional participation provides appropriate hedging.
- **Buddhist no-self**: Not engaged — outside scope for this article.

### Attribution Accuracy

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Searle I- vs. we-intentionality | Accurate ✓ |
| Searle "biologically primitive" | Accurate ✓ |
| Bratman's conditions | Corrected (was a hybrid formulation) |
| Tomasello nine-month timeline | Accurate (Tomasello's own framing) ✓ |
| Tomasello age-three norm enforcement | Accurate ✓ |
| Tomasello shared > individual reasoning | Accurate ✓ |

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Vivid opening example (carrying a table) — immediately accessible and philosophically precise
- Cascading argument structure from phenomenal intentionality through metarepresentation to institutional reality
- Phenomenological "as" structure throughout — effectively highlights where consciousness enters
- Geese vs. humans contrast — memorable and normatively precise
- Developmental evidence well-integrated — grounds philosophical argument empirically without reducing to empiricism
- Quantum restraint — article argument stands on philosophical grounds alone
- Source/Map separation — clearly labels Map interpretations with "The Map interprets..." and "the Map's position is that..."

### Enhancements Made
- Corrected Bratman's characterisation to accurately reflect both features and formal conditions
- Added functionalist engagement in normativity section with Map's reply
- Added inline cross-link to `[consciousness-and-interpersonal-understanding](/topics/consciousness-and-interpersonal-understanding/)`
- Fixed broken `[metarepresentation](/metarepresentation/)` links with appropriate alternatives
- Cleaned up frontmatter (removed unused concept)

### Cross-links Added
- [consciousness-and-interpersonal-understanding](/topics/consciousness-and-interpersonal-understanding/) (inline in body)
- [theory-of-mind](/concepts/theory-of-mind/) (replacing broken metarepresentation link)

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues addressed.

## Stability Notes

- The eliminative materialist objection (phenomenal intentionality thesis is assumed) is a bedrock disagreement: the Map commits to the phenomenal intentionality thesis as part of its framework. Future reviews should not flag this as a problem.
- Functionalist objections to the normativity argument have now been engaged. The Map's response (functional accounts lose normative force) represents a philosophical position, not a knockdown argument. Future reviews should not re-flag this unless the engagement is actually inadequate.
- The `[metarepresentation](/metarepresentation/)` concept page does not exist across the site (confirmed in earlier review of surprise-and-creativity). Multiple articles reference it. A dedicated concept page would resolve all these broken links — this is a site-wide issue, not specific to this article.
