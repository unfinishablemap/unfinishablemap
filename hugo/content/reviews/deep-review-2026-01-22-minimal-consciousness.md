# Deep Review: Minimal Consciousness

**Date**: 2026-01-22
**File**: obsidian/concepts/minimal-consciousness.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-20T06:20:00+00:00

## Task Context

This review was triggered by a P1 task to review minimal-consciousness.md in light of newly completed research on consciousness-cognition independence. The task noted: "The current article links cognition to consciousness too strongly, whereas they may be more independent. Review in light of the 'baseline cognition' hypothesis."

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Issues Identified

**Medium Issues Found:**
1. Article linked cognition and consciousness too tightly without exploring their potential independence
   - *Resolution*: Added new "Consciousness and Cognitive Capacity" section with baseline cognition hypothesis
2. No contemplative perspective section (unlike other similar articles)
   - *Resolution*: Added "Contemplative Perspectives" section with MPE, witness consciousness, and Buddhist aggregates
3. Missing cross-links to recent research notes on consciousness-cognition independence
   - *Resolution*: Added cross-links to research notes in frontmatter and Further Reading
4. Bidirectional Interaction tenet section could be strengthened
   - *Resolution*: Expanded with baseline cognition evidence supporting causal consciousness

**Low Issues Found:**
1. Further Reading section lacked organization
   - *Resolution*: Reorganized into thematic subsections

### Counterarguments Considered

The baseline cognition hypothesis could be challenged by:
- Working memory expansion explaining the gap without consciousness involvement
- AI systems achieving human-level cognition without phenomenal consciousness

These challenges are addressed in the "Implications for Minimal Consciousness" subsection and the existing "What Would Challenge This View?" section.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Excellent model organism coverage (C. elegans, Hydra, slime molds)
- Strong UAL framework presentation with nuanced treatment of its limits
- Effective illusionism response using the regress argument and complexity scaling
- Comprehensive process philosophy section connecting to Whitehead
- Thorough "What Would Challenge This View?" section with 5 falsifiability conditions
- Good balance of scientific evidence and philosophical analysis

### Enhancements Made

1. **New section**: "Consciousness and Cognitive Capacity" (~750 words)
   - Introduces baseline cognition hypothesis from great ape research
   - Covers working memory, logical reasoning, metarepresentation
   - Applies framework to each model organism (C. elegans, slime molds, insects)

2. **New section**: "Contemplative Perspectives" (~450 words)
   - Minimal phenomenal experience and Metzinger's work
   - Witness consciousness and content-stripping practices
   - Buddhist aggregates (viññāṇa) as the "knowing" function

3. **Expanded Bidirectional Interaction**: Added paragraph connecting baseline cognition evidence to causal consciousness argument

4. **Reorganized Further Reading**: Split into Core Concepts, Skeptical Perspectives, and Research Notes subsections

### Cross-links Added

- [consciousness-independent-baseline-cognition-2026-01-21](/research/consciousness-independent-baseline-cognition-2026-01-21/) (frontmatter + Further Reading)
- [consciousness-influence-intelligence-2026-01-21](/research/consciousness-influence-intelligence-2026-01-21/) (frontmatter + Further Reading)
- [witness-consciousness](/concepts/witness-consciousness/) (concepts frontmatter + Further Reading)

### References Added

- Baars, B. J. (1988) - Global Workspace Theory
- Lieberman, M. D., et al. (2008) - Logical reasoning requires consciousness
- Metzinger, T. (2024) - Minimal Phenomenal Experience
- Whiten, A. (2015) - Jourdain Hypothesis (apes have culture but don't know it)

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues were addressed in this review.

## Summary

The article now properly distinguishes between cognition and consciousness, presenting the baseline cognition hypothesis as a framework for understanding their relationship. The new section on consciousness and cognitive capacity directly addresses the original task: reviewing how cognition and consciousness may be more independent than the article previously implied. The contemplative perspectives section adds the expected meditative evidence present in other similar articles. The strengthened Bidirectional Interaction section connects the new research to the Map's tenets.
