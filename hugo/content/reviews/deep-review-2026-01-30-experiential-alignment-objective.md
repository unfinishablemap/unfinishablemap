# Deep Review: Experiential Alignment Objective

**Date**: 2026-01-30
**File**: obsidian/concepts/experiential-alignment-objective.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The article has no factual errors, internal contradictions, missing required sections, or broken links.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **MWI characterization inaccurate**: The original text claimed suffering would be "balanced by their flourishing elsewhere" under MWI. This mischaracterizes MWI—it doesn't claim experiences balance; rather, all outcomes occur in different branches. **Resolution**: Rewrote to clarify that MWI leaves no room for "promoting" certain experiences because all experiences occur across the branching structure.

2. **No acknowledgment of heterophenomenology**: The article privileged first-person methods without addressing the Dennettian critique that careful third-person study of first-person reports is the scientific approach. **Resolution**: Added a paragraph explaining why first-person methods are primary—not because they're infallible, but because experience is intrinsically subjective. Heterophenomenology that treats reports as mere behavioral data loses the target phenomenon.

3. **No falsifiability criteria**: The article acknowledged the dimensions are provisional but didn't specify what would trigger revision. **Resolution**: Added specific criteria for revision: systematic divergence from reported well-being, discovery of unmappable experiential states, profound cultural variation, or philosophical arguments showing dimension conflation.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Heterophenomenology objection** (Dennett): Why privilege introspection over careful third-person study? Addressed by explaining that treating verbal behavior as final word eliminates the phenomenon we're tracking.

- **Falsifiability objection** (Popper): What would show the dimensions are wrong? Addressed by adding specific revision criteria.

- **MWI objection** (Deutsch): The framing implied a "balancing" that MWI doesn't claim. Addressed by correcting to focus on the impossibility of "promoting" experiences when all outcomes occur.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- The constraint-based approach (rather than utility maximization)—philosophically sophisticated response to Goodhart concerns
- The distinction between phenomenal and actual agency (lines 60-61)—crucial for alignment
- The triangulation protocol acknowledging epistemic limits
- The "What the Objective Is Not" section—preempts misreadings appropriately
- The failure modes section—shows practical awareness of implementation risks
- Strong tenet connections throughout Relation to Site Perspective

### Enhancements Made

1. Added justification for first-person method primacy (new paragraph in Measurement Protocol)
2. Corrected MWI characterization to be more philosophically accurate
3. Added explicit revision criteria for the eight dimensions

### Cross-links Verified

All cross-links valid:
- [experiential-alignment](/concepts/experiential-alignment/) - exists
- [phenomenal-value-realism](/concepts/phenomenal-value-realism/) - exists
- [qualia](/concepts/qualia/) - standard concept
- [neurophenomenology](/concepts/neurophenomenology/) - exists
- [tenets](/tenets/) anchors - verified

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues were addressed in this review.

## Stability Notes

The following represent bedrock philosophical disagreements, not fixable problems:

- **Eliminativist objection**: Eliminative materialists will always reject the assumption that qualia are real and measurable. This is a fundamental philosophical disagreement about the ontology of consciousness, not a flaw in the article.

- **Buddhist non-self objection**: The framework assumes individual identity, which Buddhist philosophy questions. This is a deep metaphysical disagreement about personal identity, not something the article must resolve.

- **Quantum mechanism skepticism**: The agency dimension's connection to quantum selection is conditional on speculative physics. The article correctly uses "if" language. Future reviews should not re-flag this as problematic absent new evidence against quantum mind theories.

These disagreements are expected given the Map's tenet commitments and do not indicate article deficiencies.
