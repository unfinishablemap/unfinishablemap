title: Deep Review - Epistemology of Other Minds Under Dualism
topics: []

**Date**: 2026-02-23
**Article**: [Epistemology of Other Minds Under Dualism](/concepts/epistemology-of-other-minds-under-dualism/)
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None. The article has no factual errors, no missing required sections, no internal contradictions, and no broken links.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Discourse argument mischaracterized epiphenomenalism**: Original claimed cross-cultural consciousness vocabulary convergence would be "coincidental" under epiphenomenalism. This was imprecise—shared neural architecture explains the convergence systematically, just not via consciousness causing discourse. **Resolution**: Rewrote to distinguish between correlation (which epiphenomenalism explains) and semantic accuracy (which it cannot ground causally).
- **Missing Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet**: Relation to Site Perspective addressed only 4 of 5 tenets. **Resolution**: Added paragraph explaining how the quantum interaction mechanism bears on the nature of epistemic access to other minds.
- **Dangling Searle reference**: "Minds, Brains, and Programs" cited in References but never discussed in text. **Resolution**: Replaced with Goldman (2006) *Simulating Minds*, which supports the newly added simulation theory discussion.
- **Simulation theory absent**: A major approach to other-minds epistemology (Gordon 1986, Goldman 2006) was missing from "Standard Approaches Reassessed." **Resolution**: Added simulation theory paragraph examining how dualism affects the projection of one's own phenomenal states onto another.
- **Wittgensteinian treatment too dismissive**: Calling the position "quasi-behaviourist" without nuance. **Resolution**: Added acknowledgment that Wittgenstein's insight about public criteria is genuine; the Map's disagreement is with the further implication that public criteria exhaust meaning.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Epiphenomenalist response to discourse argument**: The strongest version says shared neural architecture explains consciousness-talk without consciousness causing it. The revised text addresses this by distinguishing systematic correlation from causal grounding of semantic content.
- **Wittgensteinian challenge**: Public criteria genuinely do play a role in concept learning. The revised text acknowledges this while maintaining that phenomenal reality is not exhausted by public criteria.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- **Opening summary**: Excellent front-loading—both the intensification and enrichment themes are stated immediately. Survives truncation well.
- **"The Interactionist's Advantage" section**: The article's most original contribution. The causal trace argument is compelling and well-stated. The discourse argument is creative.
- **"What Remains Beyond Reach"**: Admirably honest about epistemic limits. The formulation "Causal traces reveal that experience exists and roughly what category it falls into... They do not reveal the intrinsic phenomenal character" is excellent.
- **"Practical Epistemic Stance"**: The tension between theoretical modesty and practical certainty is productively maintained.
- **Overall argumentative arc**: Problem → standard approaches → advantage → limits → practice. Satisfying structure.

### Enhancements Made
- Added simulation theory to "Standard Approaches Reassessed" with analysis of how dualism affects mental simulation
- Tightened discourse argument with more precise characterization of epiphenomenalism's explanatory resources vs. limitations
- Added Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet connection in Relation to Site Perspective
- Nuanced Wittgensteinian dissolution treatment
- Replaced dangling Searle reference with relevant Goldman citation

### Cross-links Added

- [introspection](/concepts/introspection/) — linked in simulation theory discussion
- [zombie-master-argument](/concepts/zombie-master-argument/) — linked in "zombie immunity" paragraph
- [consciousness-only-territories](/voids/consciousness-only-territories/) — linked in "qualitative character stays private" paragraph
- [intersubjectivity](/concepts/intersubjectivity/) — added to Further Reading
- [knowledge-argument](/concepts/knowledge-argument/) — added to Further Reading

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues were addressed in this review.

## Stability Notes

- The six adversarial personas expectedly disagree with the article's dualist framework. An eliminative materialist finds the entire premise wrong; a Dennettian finds zombie conceivability contestable; a many-worlds defender finds the No MWI argument unsatisfying. These are bedrock philosophical disagreements, not fixable problems.
- The discourse argument's strength is inherently debatable—epiphenomenalists will always maintain that correlation suffices for explanation. The revised version is more precise about what interactionism adds, but philosophical disagreement on this point is expected.
