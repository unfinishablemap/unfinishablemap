# Deep Review: Against Epiphenomenalism

**Date**: 2026-01-21
**File**: obsidian/arguments/epiphenomenalism.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Missing illusionist challenge section**: Argument pages in the site now standardly include engagement with the illusionist position. This was absent.
   - **Resolution**: Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section with regress response and contemplative evidence subsections.

2. **Missing process philosophy perspective**: Other deep-reviewed argument pages include Whitehead's process philosophy as an alternative framework. This perspective was absent.
   - **Resolution**: Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section explaining how concrescence is causation and why the Cartesian split epiphenomenalism assumes is rejected.

3. **Missing falsifiability conditions**: Site standards now require a "What Would Challenge This View?" section.
   - **Resolution**: Added section with 5 specific falsifiability conditions.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **No decoherence challenge and response**: The article appeals to quantum mechanisms without addressing the primary objection.
   - **Resolution**: Added "The Decoherence Challenge" section with three mitigating considerations (revised timescales, biological quantum effects, decoherence doesn't solve collapse).

2. **No connection to No Many Worlds tenet**: The Relation to Site Perspective section only covered 4 of 5 tenets.
   - **Resolution**: Expanded section to explicitly connect arguments to the No Many Worlds tenet, explaining why collapse must be real for mental causation to be coherent.

3. **Insufficient cross-linking**: Missing links to key related concepts that support the arguments.
   - **Resolution**: Added 8 new concept links (illusionism, witness-consciousness, mental-effort, introspection, decoherence, haecceity, consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns, measurement-problem).

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Tracking objection**: Beliefs about quarks aren't caused by quarks; why should beliefs about consciousness require consciousness to cause them?
  - **Response addressed in regress section**: The asymmetry is that consciousness is the only domain where the subject matter *is* the seeming. Beliefs about quarks track physical effects; beliefs about consciousness must track the seeming itself.

- **Dennett's heterophenomenology**: Reports about consciousness can be reliable without consciousness causing them.
  - **Response addressed implicitly**: The illusionism section shows that even heterophenomenology requires *seemings* to cause beliefs about seemings.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- The self-stultification argument remains the article's core strength—clear, compelling, and well-structured
- The locomotive steam metaphor effectively communicates the epiphenomenalist picture
- The knowledge argument reversal is an original insight worth highlighting
- The cumulative case table provides excellent summary
- Clear, accessible prose throughout

### Enhancements Made

- Added illusionist challenge with regress response (addresses strongest materialist objection)
- Added contemplative evidence from witness-consciousness traditions
- Added process philosophy perspective (Whitehead's alternative framework)
- Added decoherence challenge and response
- Expanded Relation to Site Perspective to all 5 tenets
- Added falsifiability conditions section
- Expanded Further Reading with 5 new relevant links
- Added 4 new academic references

### Cross-links Added

- [illusionism](/concepts/illusionism/) — strongest challenge to taking phenomenal consciousness seriously
- [witness-consciousness](/concepts/witness-consciousness/) — contemplative evidence for consciousness observing itself
- [mental-effort](/concepts/mental-effort/) — phenomenology of causal efficacy
- [introspection](/concepts/introspection/) — reliability of first-person access
- [decoherence](/concepts/decoherence/) — quantum objection and response
- [haecceity](/concepts/haecceity/) — indexical identity relevant to No Many Worlds connection
- [consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns](/questions/consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns/) — the mechanism for mental causation
- [measurement-problem](/concepts/measurement-problem/) — why decoherence doesn't close the door
