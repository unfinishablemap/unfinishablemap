# Deep Review: Tenets

**File reviewed**: `tenets/tenets.md`
**Date**: 2026-01-08
**Review type**: Combined pessimistic + optimistic analysis

## Executive Summary

The tenets document is foundational and largely well-constructed. The five tenets form a coherent framework: Dualism establishes consciousness as irreducible, Minimal Quantum Interaction provides mechanism, Bidirectional Interaction grounds causal efficacy, No Many Worlds preserves indexical identity, and Occam's Razor Has Limits justifies taking dualism seriously despite apparent simplicity of physicalism.

**Strengths**: Clear structure, honest about commitments being chosen rather than proven, good anticipation of obvious objections (quantum woo, epiphenomenalism).

**Areas for enhancement**: Could benefit from cross-links to new concept pages, clarification of which type of dualism is endorsed, and addressing additional objections the site's content now enables.

## Pessimistic Analysis

### Issue 1: Type of Dualism Unspecified
**Severity**: Medium
**Location**: Dualism tenet

The document says dualism means consciousness "is not reducible to physical processes" and there exists "something beyond the material—whether substance, property, or aspect."

This is deliberately vague, covering both substance dualism (mind and matter are different substances) and property dualism (one substance with both physical and mental properties). These have different implications:
- **Substance dualism** faces the interaction problem more acutely
- **Property dualism** faces questions about why mental properties emerge

The tenets' other commitments (Bidirectional Interaction, Minimal Quantum Interaction) seem to lean toward a more robust form of dualism where consciousness has genuine causal power. Pure property dualism sometimes treats mental properties as causally inert.

**Suggestion**: Consider clarifying that the site endorses something stronger than epiphenomenal property dualism—mental properties have genuine causal efficacy. This might be called "interactionist property dualism" or could be framed as accepting substance dualism's causal claims while remaining agnostic about whether there's a separate mental substance.

### Issue 2: Decoherence Objection Not Addressed
**Severity**: Medium
**Location**: Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet

The document anticipates "quantum woo" objections but doesn't address the decoherence objection: quantum superpositions decohere extremely rapidly in warm, wet environments like brains. Tegmark calculated decoherence times on the order of 10^-13 seconds for neural processes—far too fast for macroscopic quantum effects to matter.

The site now has content on quantum mechanics and consciousness (retrocausality article, Penrose-Hameroff in research notes) that could support a response.

**Possible responses to mention**:
1. The question isn't whether coherence persists but whether consciousness influences which classical state emerges
2. Retrocausal models don't require coherence—influence can propagate backward
3. Penrose-Hameroff's Orch OR proposes quantum effects in microtubules may be protected from decoherence

**Suggestion**: Add brief mention of decoherence objection and pointer to how site addresses it.

### Issue 3: No Positive Account of Mechanism
**Severity**: Low
**Location**: Bidirectional Interaction tenet

The document provides an analogy (Schrödinger's cat) but not a mechanism. How does consciousness "select" among superposed states? What makes this non-physical influence? The analogy illuminates the structure of the claim without explaining how it works.

This is arguably appropriate for a tenets document (stating commitments, not theories). But readers may want more.

**Suggestion**: Add cross-link to research notes on interactionist dualism (Stapp, Penrose-Hameroff) which provide candidate mechanisms.

### Issue 4: Missing Cross-Links
**Severity**: Low
**Location**: Throughout

The tenets document was written before many concept pages existed. It could benefit from cross-links to:
- [qualia](/concepts/qualia/) (for Dualism tenet)
- [retrocausality](/concepts/retrocausality/) (for Bidirectional Interaction)
- [panpsychism](/concepts/panpsychism/) (for comparison in Dualism section)
- [hard-problem-of-consciousness](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/) (for rationale)

## Optimistic Analysis

### Strength 1: Honest Epistemics
The opening line—"They are not proven—they are chosen starting points"—sets exactly the right tone. This avoids the trap of defending tenets as conclusions rather than premises. Readers know what they're getting: a framework to explore, not a proof to accept.

### Strength 2: Coherent System
The five tenets interlock well:
- Dualism → need mechanism → Minimal Quantum Interaction
- Mechanism → must actually affect things → Bidirectional Interaction
- Bidirectional Interaction → need single world for choices to matter → No Many Worlds
- Taking dualism seriously despite apparent complexity → Occam's Razor Has Limits

This isn't a grab-bag of claims but a thought-through position.

### Strength 3: Anticipates Objections
- "Not to be confused with quantum woo" preempts the most common dismissal
- The epiphenomenalism response is developed at length
- "Rules out" sections make clear what the site rejects

### Strength 4: "Rules Out" Clarity
Each tenet explicitly states what it excludes. This makes the framework falsifiable and shows intellectual honesty about its commitments.

### Strength 5: Historical Counterexamples
The Occam's Razor section provides concrete historical cases (heliocentrism, atomic theory, QM, relativity) where simplicity pointed away from truth. This grounds an abstract methodological point in familiar examples.

## Suggested Enhancements

### Enhancement 1: Add Cross-Links
Update tenets document to link to relevant concept and topic pages:

In Dualism section:
- Link to [hard-problem-of-consciousness](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/)
- Link to [qualia](/concepts/qualia/)

In Minimal Quantum Interaction section:
- Link to [retrocausality](/concepts/retrocausality/) research
- Link to interactionist-dualism research notes

In Bidirectional Interaction section:
- Link to [free-will](/topics/free-will/) (new topic)

### Enhancement 2: Brief Decoherence Mention
Add to Minimal Quantum Interaction:

> **Objection: Decoherence.** Critics note that quantum superpositions decohere extremely rapidly in warm, wet environments. Responses include: (1) the question is which classical state emerges, not whether coherence persists; (2) retrocausal models don't require maintained coherence; (3) some structures (Penrose-Hameroff's microtubules) may protect against decoherence. See [retrocausality](/concepts/retrocausality/) and research notes for details.

### Enhancement 3: Clarify Dualism Type
Add to Dualism definition:

> the site remains agnostic about whether this requires a separate mental substance (substance dualism) or whether the physical can have irreducibly mental properties (property dualism). What matters is that mental properties have genuine causal efficacy—the site rejects any view where consciousness is causally inert.

### Enhancement 4: Add Section Links to Index
Consider adding anchor links to the site index or tenets section for easy navigation to specific tenets.

## Quality Metrics

| Metric | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Clarity | High | Definitions are crisp |
| Coherence | High | Tenets form integrated system |
| Honesty | High | Admits these are starting points |
| Objection handling | Medium | Addresses obvious objections, misses some |
| Cross-linking | Low | Needs updates for new content |
| Mechanism | Low | By design—this is tenets, not theory |

## Conclusion

The tenets document is solid and serves its purpose well. The main opportunity is updating it to cross-link with the substantial content that has been built around these foundations. Secondary improvements involve addressing the decoherence objection and clarifying the type of dualism endorsed.

No critical issues. The document works as intended.

## Action Items

1. [ ] Add cross-links to relevant concept/topic pages
2. [ ] Add brief decoherence mention with pointers to detailed content
3. [ ] Clarify that site endorses causally efficacious dualism
4. [ ] Consider adding "related_articles" to frontmatter
