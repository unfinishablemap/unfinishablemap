title: Deep Review - Haecceity and Indexical Identity
topics: []
---

**Date**: 2026-02-01
**Article**: [Haecceity and Indexical Identity](/concepts/haecceity/)
**Previous review**: [2026-01-26](/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-26-haecceity/)
**Cross-review context**: indexical-facts.md

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The article has received two prior deep reviews (2026-01-20, 2026-01-26) and is stable. All six adversarial personas (Eliminative Materialist, Hard-Nosed Physicalist, Quantum Skeptic, Many-Worlds Defender, Empiricist, Buddhist Philosopher) were applied—all raised philosophical disagreements rather than fixable flaws.

### Attribution Accuracy Check

Verified all attributions:
- Duns Scotus (haecceity origin): Correct
- Max Black (two spheres): Correct
- Parfit (anti-haecceitism, psychological continuity): Correct
- Bailey, Rasmussen, Van Horn (pairing problem response): Correct
- Hellie (vertiginous question): Correct
- Wallace, Greaves (decision-theoretic Born rule): Correct
- Tallis (illusionism regress): Correct

No attribution errors found.

### Medium Issues Found

- **Missing cross-link to indexical-facts.md**: The new indexical-facts.md concept page provides a fuller treatment of indexical facts. The haecceity article mentioned the concept but didn't link to it. **Resolution**: Added [indexical-facts](/indexical-facts/) to concepts frontmatter, added wikilink in body text where indexical facts are first defined, added to Further Reading.

- **Redundant Lewis "Two Gods" explanation**: Both articles explained this scenario; indexical-facts.md now provides the fuller treatment. **Resolution**: Condensed the explanation in haecceity.md with a link to indexical-facts.md.

### Low Issues Found

None requiring action. Previously identified low issues (heterophenomenology not named, Buddhist response qualifications) remain appropriately deferred.

### Counterarguments Considered

All six adversarial personas applied. The article already engages well with:
- Illusionism (Tallis regress argument)
- Buddhist critiques (process-haecceity compatibility)
- MWI decision theory (caring presupposes indexical identity)

These represent bedrock philosophical disagreements, not fixable flaws.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Truncation-resilient opening summary
- Clear haecceitism vs anti-haecceitism distinction
- Zombie argument integration with dualism
- Teleportation/uploading thought experiments
- Process Philosophy section (Whitehead connection)
- Falsifiability section ("What Would Challenge This View")
- Comprehensive illusionist and Buddhist engagement
- Strong references section

### Enhancements Made

- Added [indexical-facts](/indexical-facts/) cross-link in concepts frontmatter
- Added [indexical-facts](/indexical-facts/) wikilink in body text (indexical facts definition)
- Added [indexical-facts](/indexical-facts/) to Further Reading (first position—most directly relevant for cross-review)
- Condensed Lewis "Two Gods" explanation with link to indexical-facts.md

### Cross-links Added

- [indexical-facts](/indexical-facts/) — Three locations (frontmatter, body, Further Reading)

## Changes Summary

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Critical issues addressed | 0 |
| Medium issues addressed | 2 |
| New cross-links | 1 (in 3 locations) |
| Word count before | 2998 |
| Word count after | 3002 |
| Net change | +4 words (length-neutral) |

## Remaining Items

None. The article is stable after three comprehensive reviews. Cross-review integration with indexical-facts.md is complete.

## Stability Notes

This article has now received three deep reviews (2026-01-20, 2026-01-26, 2026-02-01). The article is mature and stable.

**Bedrock disagreements (do NOT re-flag as critical):**
- MWI defenders finding indexical arguments unsatisfying
- Buddhists questioning substance assumptions
- Physicalists rejecting haecceity as primitive
- Illusionist response not naming heterophenomenology by name (Tallis regress suffices)
- Buddhist process-haecceity framed as "possible" not "certain"

**Cross-review integration complete:**
- haecceity.md now properly links to indexical-facts.md
- Redundant explanation of Lewis "Two Gods" condensed

The article remains at 120% of soft threshold (3002 words vs 2500 target). Further additions should be balanced by equivalent cuts.
