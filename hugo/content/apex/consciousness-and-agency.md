We believe ourselves to be authors of our actions. When you choose to speak rather than stay silent, to help rather than ignore, the choice seems genuinely yours. You could have done otherwise. You are responsible for what you did. These convictions structure our lives—our relationships, our institutions, our sense of who we are.

Yet they face a formidable challenge: if every physical event has a sufficient physical cause, where is there room for consciousness to contribute anything? If your decision was determined by neural events stretching back before your birth, in what sense did *you* decide?

The Unfinishable Map's answer is agent-causal: consciousness genuinely authors action by selecting among quantum possibilities that physics leaves undetermined. It is consciousness as source—the agent who determines which of several genuinely open alternatives becomes actual. This selection grounds both free will and the moral responsibility that depends on it.

## The Authorship Problem

The classical picture of physics suggested a clockwork universe. Given initial conditions and deterministic laws, all future states follow necessarily. Your brain is a physical system; physical systems obey physical laws; therefore your "choices" are consequences of prior causes you neither chose nor controlled.

Three traditional responses emerge. Hard determinism accepts the implication: free will is an illusion. Compatibilism argues that freedom is compatible with determinism. Libertarianism insists on genuine alternatives but faces the challenge of explaining how undetermined choices avoid being merely random.

Compatibilism deserves serious engagement because it represents the current philosophical mainstream and its strongest versions are formidable. Fischer and Ravizza's *reasons-responsive mechanism* holds that an agent acts freely when their action-producing mechanism is moderately responsive to reasons—capable of recognising and reacting to rational considerations across a suitable range of scenarios. Wolf's *Reason View* goes further: free action requires the ability to act in accordance with the True and the Good. Dennett argues that compatibilist freedom is the only "freedom worth wanting"—that adding agent causation and quantum indeterminacy contributes nothing of value to what reasons-responsiveness already provides.

These positions are not merely practical accommodations. Their proponents argue they are *metaphysically* adequate—that the libertarian addition is confused rather than unnecessary. If your action flows from your own reasons-responsive processes, what more could sourcehood require?

The Map's answer: reasons-responsiveness without sourcehood is insufficient because it cannot ground the distinction between an agent who acts for reasons and a mechanism that *processes* reasons. Fischer's account explains why an agent's action is appropriate given their reasons; it does not explain why those reasons, rather than others, are *the agent's*. If the reasons-responsive mechanism is itself the product of deterministic causes the agent never chose, the agent is a conduit for causes rather than their origin. The phenomenology of deliberation—genuinely weighing alternatives, feeling the pull of competing considerations—tracks something that pure reasons-responsiveness leaves unexplained. And the [argument from reason](/topics/argument-from-reason/) sharpens the point: if beliefs are fully determined by physical causes, their alignment with rational norms is coincidental. Reasons-responsiveness is a happy accident rather than genuine rational agency.

The Map's framework is libertarian, but with a specific mechanism: consciousness selects among quantum possibilities. Quantum mechanics introduces genuine indeterminacy—physics specifies probabilities but not which outcome occurs. This is the [definite outcomes problem](/topics/quantum-measurement-consciousness-interface/)—a gap in the causal order that determinism cannot close. But critics rightly object: quantum randomness doesn't give us free will. A random choice is no more *mine* than a determined one. This is the [luck objection](/concepts/agent-causation/#the-luck-objection)—the central challenge any libertarian position must answer.

The Map's answer unfolds across several interlocking ideas: a model of how consciousness operates, an account of what kind of cause the agent is, and an explanation of why this selection isn't arbitrary. Each piece supports the others.

## The Selector Model

A crucial implication of the Map's framework: consciousness is primarily a *selector*. The brain does the computational work—representing possibilities, simulating consequences, preparing motor programs. Consciousness selects among these alternatives. It arbitrates; it does not construct from scratch.

This follows from two tenets. [Minimal quantum interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) demands that consciousness's influence be as small as possible. [Bidirectional interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) requires that consciousness genuinely affect outcomes. The resolution: consciousness exerts just enough influence to select among options that physics has already prepared.

A genuine difficulty arises here: selecting among complex neural firing patterns requires influencing *macroscopic* brain states, not individual quantum events. How does minimal quantum bias produce macroscopic neural selection? The proposed answer involves amplification—small quantum biases cascading through sensitive neural dynamics into large-scale pattern selection, much as tiny perturbations in chaotic systems produce dramatically different trajectories. The [mental causation](/concepts/mental-causation/) article discusses coupling mechanisms in more detail. Whether this amplification is physically realistic remains an open empirical question—one the framework must ultimately answer rather than simply acknowledge.

Most cognition is therefore *nonconscious scaffolding*—creative generation, consequence evaluation, motor preparation are brain processes. The "action channel" through which consciousness influences the world has limited bandwidth. The [attentional economics](/concepts/attentional-economics/) framework captures this: agency operates through the ongoing allocation of a finite attentional resource, making freedom scale with attentional skill.

Yet the selector model requires a caveat. As [recent work on creative generation](/concepts/agent-causation/) argues, consciousness doesn't merely select from a fixed menu—it also *generates* options through imaginative exploration. Each movement of attention opens further possibilities that didn't exist before the exploration. The agent contributes both which options become actual and which options exist. This generation-selection interplay strengthens the authorship claim: the agent explains the outcome more fully when they also constituted the options available. Still, generation itself operates through the narrow attentional channel; the brain provides the substrate while consciousness navigates it.

## Agent Causation: The Agent as Source

The Map invokes [agent causation](/concepts/agent-causation/). Most causal explanations trace event to event: the desire caused the decision; the decision caused the movement. Agent causation is different. The agent—as a persisting substance, not a collection of events—directly causes the action. The regress of causes stops at the agent.

This matters for authorship. Event-causal libertarianism—where mental events cause actions nondeterministically—doesn't fully deliver sourcehood. If your decision is caused by prior mental events you didn't choose, you remain a conduit for causes rather than their origin. Agent causation places the explanatory buck with the agent. Why did you choose A rather than B? Because *you* exercised causal power in favour of A.

Critics find this unsatisfying. "The agent caused it" seems to name the problem rather than solve it. What about the agent explains the choice? But this objection presupposes event-causal reduction—assumes that any genuine explanation must trace back to prior events. Agent causation rejects this assumption. Physics doesn't explain why the universe exists; it takes existence as given. Similarly, agent causation takes the agent's power to select as primitive. Explanation must terminate somewhere; "the agent selected for reasons" is a legitimate terminus.

Sartre's analysis illuminates a structural feature the framework requires. Consider: you can reflect on your own anger, question whether it's justified, decide whether to act on it. This ability to stand apart from your own mental states—to be aware *of* them rather than simply *being* them—is what Sartre called the *pour-soi* (being-for-itself). A being that merely *is* its states cannot evaluate or override them. The pour-soi's self-distance captures the gap between consciousness and its objects that makes selection possible. Sartre's existentialist freedom differs from the Map's agent-causal libertarianism in important respects—Sartre is a phenomenological ontologist, not a substance dualist, and his radical freedom is a thesis about the structure of consciousness rather than about quantum indeterminacy. But his analysis of the pour-soi identifies the structural precondition the Map's framework requires: consciousness must be distanced from its contents to select among them.

E.J. Lowe and Timothy O'Connor argue that *all* causation is fundamentally [substance causation](/concepts/agent-causation/#the-metaphysical-foundation-substance-causation)—agents exercising powers. If they're right, agent causation isn't metaphysically exceptional; it's paradigmatic. Whitehead's [process philosophy](/concepts/process-philosophy/) reaches a compatible conclusion from different premises: if all causation involves experiential self-determination, human agent causation is continuous with causation generally rather than a strange exception to it. The question shifts from "How can consciousness possibly cause anything?" to "Why did we think it couldn't?"

## Escaping the Luck Objection

The luck objection deserves direct engagement. Peter van Inwagen's rollback argument: replay time after an agent chooses A. Since the choice was undetermined, different outcomes appear across replays. But the agent was identical until the moment of decision. The difference seems pure luck.

The Map distinguishes consciousness-selected indeterminism from lucky indeterminism through three features. First, selection is *reasons-guided*—consciousness selects A because A serves goals and expresses values. Reasons don't *determine* the outcome but they *guide* it. "Why A rather than B? Because the agent had reasons for A."

Second, selection involves *[phenomenology of effort](/concepts/phenomenology-of-choice/)*—choosing feels effortful in ways that track genuine cognitive load. Random processes don't feel like work; hard choices feel hard because the phenomenology tracks real causal engagement. The correlation between felt difficulty and measured cognitive load would be coincidental if phenomenology had no functional role. The simpler explanation: phenomenology tracks something real.

Third, selection shows *distinctive neural signatures*—willed attention and movement engage frontal theta oscillations and bidirectional frontoparietal coherence that automatic actions lack. Neurosurgical studies reveal a striking dissociation: stimulating one brain area produces conscious intention *without* movement, while stimulating another produces movement *without* any feeling of intending. The phenomenology of deciding is neurally separable from execution machinery—consciousness operates at the selection interface, not in downstream motor circuits. The same selection architecture appears in both attention and motor control, suggesting a unified mechanism rather than coincidence.

Together, these features answer the luck objection: the agent explains the difference between worlds because the agent *selected* for reasons, with phenomenal engagement, through mechanisms that distinguish selection from reception.

But selection guided by reasons requires more than phenomenal effort. It requires the capacity to represent and evaluate alternatives before choosing—which is where counterfactual reasoning and the capacity to refrain both enter the picture.

## The Capacity to Refrain

Contemplative practice reveals that consciousness can not only select among options but *refrain from selecting*—entering a [witness mode](/concepts/witness-consciousness/) where alternatives present themselves without resolution. This capacity further sharpens the distinction between agent-causal selection and mere randomness. A passive recipient of random quantum events could not choose to be passive. The very capacity to suspend selection shows consciousness does something rather than merely receiving outcomes.

This yields a three-level structure: the agent can select among options, refrain from selecting, or choose which mode to operate in. The Buddhist Abhidhamma describes this precisely—distinguishing *cetanā* (intention/volition) from preceding mental factors, and observing intention in the gap between stimulus and response. The framework doesn't require a Cartesian ego; it requires only *phenomenal unity*—the experiential integration that makes deliberation possible.

## Counterfactual Reasoning and Deliberation

Genuine choice requires more than selecting among options—it requires [counterfactual reasoning](/concepts/counterfactual-reasoning/), the capacity to represent alternatives and evaluate what would follow from each. Comparative psychology clarifies what this demands: a sated chimpanzee won't store food for future hunger because it cannot hold both its current state and the counterfactual hungry-future-self simultaneously. Great apes show working memory capacity of roughly 2±1 items versus humans' 7±2—limiting their ability to maintain actual situation, counterfactual premise, and consequences together.

Counterfactual reasoning is *how* consciousness causally engages with options—it is the mechanism that transforms selection from arbitrary quantum fluctuation into genuine deliberation. Without it, the agent's choice would be no better than a coin flip dressed in phenomenological clothing. Deliberation *feels* like holding multiple possibilities open, exploring their implications, and then settling on one. This is the fulcrum of the entire framework: selection without counterfactual evaluation would be mere preference expression; selection *through* counterfactual evaluation is the reasons-responsive authorship that grounds both free will and moral responsibility.

## Mental Causation and the Exclusion Problem

Agent causation requires that mental states actually cause physical effects. But [mental causation](/concepts/mental-causation/) faces Jaegwon Kim's exclusion argument: if every physical event has a sufficient physical cause (causal closure), mental causes seem excluded—either consciousness is identical to brain states or it causes nothing.

The Map offers two independent responses. The first denies causal closure at quantum indeterminacies. Physics provides necessary but not sufficient causes at these points. Consciousness selects among outcomes physics leaves undetermined, causing physical events without competing with physical causes. No overdetermination occurs because physics doesn't determine everything.

The second draws on Bradford Saad's [delegatory dualism](/topics/delegatory-dualism/) (2025): experiences *[preempt](/concepts/preemption/)* rather than overdetermine physical causes. Physical brain states have a default causal profile—the effects they *would* produce absent any experience. When an experience arises, it takes over this causal work. As Saad's analogy suggests: a major and a sergeant both order troops to advance, but the major's order preempts the sergeant's—one cause operates while the other is sidelined. Mental causation is genuine without requiring overdetermination. Saad's distinction between *universal* closure and *[observational closure](/concepts/causal-closure/)* parallels the Map's quantum framework: mental causation can be genuine without producing empirically detectable anomalies.

The [argument from reason](/topics/argument-from-reason/) provides an entirely independent route to mental causation—one that doesn't depend on phenomenological evidence at all. Rational inference requires tracking normative relationships—what follows from what, what counts as good evidence. Neurons fire because of electrochemical gradients, not because firing would be *justified*. If all beliefs are fully explained by nonrational physical causes, no belief is rationally justified—including physicalism. This self-defeat structure shows that rationality requires mental causation. The argument serves as the framework's failsafe: even if someone doubted the phenomenology of effort or contested the neural signatures of willed action, rationality itself would still demand that consciousness causes something.

## Time, Collapse, and Selection

With mental causation established, a timing challenge remains. The Libet experiments show neural activity "predicting" decisions before conscious awareness. If the brain decides before consciousness knows, how can consciousness be the author?

The neuroscientific picture is more complex than it seems. Schurger et al. (2012) proposed the readiness potential reflects neural noise, not decision preparation. Sjöberg (2024) provides stronger evidence: patients with surgical resection of the supplementary motor area—the region generating the readiness potential—retain their sense of voluntary action. These findings weaken the Libet challenge on its own terms.

But the Map offers a more fundamental resolution—one that reframes the problem rather than merely answering it. To grasp it, set aside the common-sense picture where causes always precede effects. At the fundamental level, quantum mechanics is time-symmetric—equations work equally well forward and backward. Retrocausal interpretations take this seriously: quantum events involve "handshakes" between past and future boundary conditions that are themselves atemporal.

An analogy helps: a mathematical function can determine which curve appears on a graph without the function itself being located on the graph. Similarly, consciousness's selection determines which temporal sequence becomes real without that selection being a temporal event.

Applied to the Libet problem: the selection doesn't happen at a moment in time; it determines *which* moments become actual. The neural activity preceding awareness is part of the selected transaction, not evidence against conscious causation. Consciousness doesn't need to precede neural preparation to be its cause—the selection determines which temporal sequence becomes real, including the neural history that preceded awareness. What we see as neural activity "predicting" the decision is actually the selected history.

The following extension is speculative—it goes beyond the core argument, which does not depend on it. If consciousness participates in [collapse](/concepts/collapse-and-time/), and collapse introduces time's arrow, then consciousness may help constitute temporal structure itself. Whitehead's "concrescence"—the process by which each actual occasion achieves definiteness—parallels this: before concrescence, the occasion is indeterminate; after, it's a settled fact. If consciousness participates in collapse, it participates in the fundamental process by which temporal structure accretes. The phenomenology of temporal flow—the sense of past closing and future opening—may be what constituting time feels like from within. These are extraordinary claims—that consciousness is partly responsible for time's arrow—and should be treated as a speculative frontier of the framework rather than an established conclusion.

## Moral Responsibility Grounded

If consciousness genuinely authors action, [moral responsibility](/concepts/moral-responsibility/) gains metaphysical grounding. Compatibilist desert is pragmatic—holding people responsible has good consequences. Agent-causal desert is metaphysical—people really deserve praise and blame because they really originated their actions.

The same property that makes agents subjects of moral concern—consciousness—makes them subjects of moral responsibility. The [consciousness-value connection](/concepts/consciousness-value-connection/) runs in both directions: consciousness grounds both who can be harmed and who can be held to account.

Retribution becomes intelligible: the wrongdoer exercised causal power to harm when they could have caused good. They deserve consequences proportional to what they did. This doesn't mean harsh punishment is required—mercy and reform remain legitimate—but the retributivist intuition has metaphysical backing.

Mitigation has limits. Prior causes influenced but didn't determine. The addict who steals chose to steal, even if addiction made resisting harder. Difficulty doesn't equal impossibility.

Character responsibility becomes intelligible because character is partly self-created. Each choice reinforces or modifies dispositions. Over time, agents shape who they become through repeated exercises of selection. The [attentional economics](/concepts/attentional-economics/) framework deepens this: developing attentional skill is itself an exercise of agency. Agents are responsible not just for individual choices but for cultivating or neglecting the capacity to choose well. The [full moral implications](/topics/moral-implications-of-genuine-agency/) extend beyond desert to encompass obligation, moral luck, and the demands genuine agency places on moral theory.

## Synthesis

The interlocking elements form a structure whose implications exceed any individual component. The individual components—agent causation, mental causation, quantum indeterminacy, counterfactual reasoning, temporal constitution—each face objections when considered in isolation. Together, they form a mutually supporting structure where each element answers objections to the others.

A critic might object that this mutual support is circular: agent causation requires mental causation, which requires quantum indeterminacy, which requires genuine collapse, which requires consciousness to determine outcomes—bringing us back to agent causation. The concern is legitimate: mutual support becomes viciously circular when every element's credibility depends entirely on accepting the others.

The framework avoids this because several elements have independent grounding outside the circle. Three anchor points are not framework-dependent:

1. **The hard problem of consciousness.** That consciousness is not reducible to physical processes is argued independently of agent causation or quantum mechanics—through zombie arguments, the knowledge argument, and the explanatory gap. Dualism stands or falls on its own merits.
2. **The argument from reason.** The self-defeat of physicalism—that fully physical beliefs cannot be rationally justified—provides a route to mental causation that requires no phenomenological premises and no quantum physics. This argument works even if the selector model is wrong.
3. **The phenomenology of effort and its neural correlates.** The correlation between felt difficulty and cognitive load, the neural dissociation between intention and execution, and the distinct signatures of willed versus automatic action are empirical findings that don't presuppose the framework. They require *explanation*, and the framework provides one—but the data exist independently.

These anchor points ground the framework in independently verifiable evidence. The remaining elements—the selector model, atemporal selection, creative generation—gain their plausibility from how well they integrate with these anchored claims, not from circular self-support.

Counterfactual reasoning provides the mechanism that makes selection reasons-responsive rather than arbitrary. Creative generation ensures the agent isn't choosing from a fixed menu but constituting the option space through imaginative exploration. The convergence extends across philosophical traditions. Empirical psychology reveals the willed/automatic distinction. Sartre's phenomenology illuminates why consciousness can stand apart from its states to choose. Process philosophy shows why experiential causation is continuous with causation generally rather than metaphysically exceptional. The [argument from reason](/topics/argument-from-reason/) provides a safety net: even if phenomenological evidence were somehow discounted, rationality itself requires consciousness to cause something—otherwise no belief, including physicalism, is rationally justified.

Significant uncertainties remain. The amplification mechanism—how minimal quantum bias produces macroscopic neural selection—is empirically unresolved. The temporal constitution thesis is speculative. Compatibilism offers a sophisticated alternative that many philosophers find adequate. The framework's strength lies not in certainty but in its capacity to unify independently grounded claims into a coherent account of what authorship requires.

If the framework is correct, what follows for lived experience is this: you are not a passive spectator of determined events, nor a victim of random fluctuations. You are an agent—a conscious being who selects among genuinely open possibilities for reasons that matter to you, after genuinely evaluating alternatives. When you chose to speak rather than stay silent, that choice was yours. Your selections constitute your life, shape your character, ground your responsibility. The everyday sense of authorship—so easily dismissed as folk psychology—tracks the structure of mind and world.

## What Would Challenge This View?

The framework is not unfalsifiable. Unlike the individual source articles, which list challenges to their specific claims, this synthesis faces challenges to the *combined* position—the claim that consciousness genuinely authors action through agent-causal selection.

**Decisive neural prediction.** If voluntary choices could be predicted from prior neural states with near-perfect accuracy (>95%), the quantum gap the framework requires would close. Current prediction accuracy for simple binary choices remains around 60%—well short of this threshold. But dramatic advances in neural decoding would challenge the view directly.

**A materialist solution to the hard problem.** The framework's dualism anchor depends on consciousness being irreducible to physical processes. A genuinely satisfying physicalist account of why certain arrangements of matter *feel like something*—one that doesn't merely redescribe the problem—would undermine the foundation. Current proposals (functionalism, illusionism, higher-order theories) face persistent objections, but a breakthrough would be significant.

**Dissociation of phenomenology from function.** If the felt effort of choosing could be systematically dissociated from cognitive load—effort feeling easy when neural demands are high, or vice versa—the phenomenological evidence for agent causation would collapse. Current evidence shows reliable correlation, but finding systematic exceptions would matter.

**Confirmation of many-worlds.** If the many-worlds interpretation were empirically confirmed, there would be no collapse for consciousness to influence. All outcomes would occur in branching universes, and selection would be illusory.

**Successful compatibilist sourcehood.** If a compatibilist account could deliver genuine sourcehood—explaining not just why an agent's action is reasons-responsive but why those reasons are *the agent's* in a metaphysically robust sense—the motivation for libertarian agent causation would weaken substantially.

Note what would *not* undermine the framework: failure of any particular proposed mechanism (such as quantum approaches to the interaction channel) would require finding an alternative gap in physical causation, not abandoning the philosophical case for agent causation. The core argument rests on phenomenology, the hard problem, and the argument from reason—not on any specific physics.

## Relation to Site Perspective

This article draws on all five tenets. **[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: Agent causation requires consciousness to be ontologically distinct from physics—otherwise it inherits determinism or random indeterminism. **[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)**: The selector model is a direct application—consciousness causally influences physical outcomes through quantum selection. **[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)**: The influence works within what physics allows rather than overriding it—selecting among outcomes, not injecting energy. **[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)**: Selection requires real collapse; if all outcomes occur in branching worlds, consciousness selects nothing. Desert requires that alternatives were genuinely rejected, not merely routed elsewhere. **[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)**: The framework is metaphysically rich, but simpler pictures fail to capture what ordinary moral practice assumes and what the phenomenology of choosing reveals. The complexity may reflect reality's structure.
