This document defines the approved apex article subjects. Apex articles are human-readable synthesis pieces that weave multiple topics and concepts into unified narratives. The Map maintains a curated set of 10-20 apex articles covering major themes.

## Approved Apex Articles

### 1. The Explanatory Frontier

**Slug**: `explanatory-frontier`

**Subtitle**: Why consciousness defies reduction

**Thesis**: The hard problem isn't a puzzle to solve but a boundary marker—showing where physical explanation ends and a different kind of account begins.

**Source articles**:
- topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness
- topics/mysterianism-cognitive-closure
- topics/first-person-third-person-methodology
- topics/consciousness-and-mathematical-understanding
- concepts/explanatory-gap

**Status**: Created 2026-01-24

### 2. Consciousness and Agency

**Slug**: `consciousness-and-agency`

**Subtitle**: How mind authors action in a physical world

**Thesis**: Genuine authorship requires consciousness to select among quantum possibilities, grounding both free will and moral responsibility.

**Source articles**:
- topics/free-will
- concepts/agent-causation
- concepts/mental-causation
- topics/argument-from-reason
- concepts/moral-responsibility
- topics/time-collapse-and-agency
- concepts/voluntary-attention-control

### 3. The Ground of Meaning

**Slug**: `ground-of-meaning`

**Subtitle**: Why understanding is constitutively experiential

**Thesis**: Meaning is phenomenal—understanding involves irreducible experiential character that unconscious systems lack.

**Source articles**:
- topics/meaning-and-consciousness
- topics/language-recursion-and-consciousness
- topics/consciousness-as-intelligence-amplifier
- topics/baseline-cognition
- topics/ai-consciousness
- concepts/cognitive-phenomenology

**Status**: Not yet created

### 4. Identity Across Transformations

**Slug**: `identity-across-transformations`

**Subtitle**: What persists as "you" through change and fragmentation

**Thesis**: Identity is irreducibly indexical—being *this* consciousness matters in ways pattern-based accounts cannot capture.

**Source articles**:
- topics/personal-identity
- topics/death-and-consciousness
- topics/split-brain-consciousness
- topics/indexical-identity-quantum-measurement
- topics/altered-states-consciousness
- topics/loss-of-consciousness

**Status**: Not yet created

### 5. The Moral Weight of Experience

**Slug**: `moral-weight-of-experience`

**Subtitle**: Which beings matter and why

**Thesis**: Consciousness grounds moral status—presence or absence of experience determines who counts morally.

**Source articles**:
- topics/ethics-of-consciousness
- topics/animal-consciousness
- topics/consciousness-in-simple-organisms
- topics/emotional-consciousness
- topics/purpose-and-alignment

**Status**: Not yet created

### 6. Consciousness at the Quantum Edge

**Slug**: `quantum-edge`

**Subtitle**: Physics, time, and measurement

**Thesis**: Consciousness may be fundamental to physics itself—not an anomaly to explain away but potentially constitutive of temporal irreversibility and quantum measurement.

**Source articles**:
- topics/time-perception-consciousness-theories
- topics/quantum-binding-and-phenomenal-unity
- topics/quantum-neural-timing-constraints
- topics/quantum-measurement-interpretations-beyond-mwi
- topics/conservation-laws-and-mind
- concepts/collapse-and-time

### 7. The Contemplative Path

**Slug**: `contemplative-path`

**Subtitle**: What careful attention reveals about consciousness

**Thesis**: Contemplative traditions and phenomenological philosophy access aspects of consciousness that third-person neuroscience cannot reach.

**Source articles**:
- topics/eastern-philosophy-consciousness
- concepts/witness-consciousness
- concepts/meditation-consciousness-modes
- concepts/introspection
- topics/epistemic-advantages-of-dualism
- topics/aesthetic-dimension-of-consciousness

**Status**: Not yet created

### 8. Minds Without Words

**Slug**: `minds-without-words`

**Subtitle**: Consciousness beyond human language

**Thesis**: Non-linguistic consciousness in animals and simple organisms reveals that experience is more fundamental than the cognitive capacities we usually associate with mind.

**Source articles**:
- topics/animal-consciousness
- topics/consciousness-in-simple-organisms
- topics/baseline-cognition
- concepts/phenomenal-consciousness
- topics/emotional-consciousness

**Status**: Not yet created

### 9. The Machine Question

**Slug**: `machine-question`

**Subtitle**: Can artifacts be conscious?

**Thesis**: Current AI systems lack consciousness not because of implementation details but because computation alone cannot generate experience—the gap is principled, not practical.

**Source articles**:
- topics/ai-consciousness
- topics/machine-consciousness
- concepts/functionalism
- concepts/chinese-room
- topics/consciousness-as-intelligence-amplifier

**Status**: Not yet created

### 10. Living and Dying Consciously

**Slug**: `living-and-dying`

**Subtitle**: Consciousness and the shape of a life

**Thesis**: If consciousness is what matters, then living well means cultivating rich experience, and death is the cessation of what has intrinsic value.

**Source articles**:
- topics/death-and-consciousness
- topics/meaning-of-life
- topics/purpose-and-alignment
- concepts/phenomenal-value-realism
- topics/meaning-and-consciousness

## Reserved Slots (11-20)

Future apex articles will be added as the Map evolves and new thematic clusters emerge. Potential candidates:

- The Unity Problem (binding, phenomenal unity, split-brain)
- Consciousness and Creativity (aesthetic experience, imagination)
- The Self Illusion? (selfhood, witness consciousness, Buddhism)
- Altered States and What They Reveal
- The Evolution of Experience

## Guidelines

- **Maximum 20 apex articles** — Keep the set curated and coherent
- **Each article must have a clear thesis** — Not just a collection of topics
- **Source articles should already exist** — Don't create apex articles for gaps in content
- **Use `/apex-evolve create`** to generate new articles from this list
- **Update status** when articles are created
