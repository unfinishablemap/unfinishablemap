Occam's Razor—the principle that simpler explanations should be preferred—is the most common objection to [dualism](/concepts/interactionist-dualism/). Physicalism posits one kind of substance; dualism posits two. Case closed? The Unfinishable Map argues no. Parsimony fails as a decisive principle in the consciousness debate for reasons that are well-established in the philosophical literature but rarely assembled together. The precondition for applying parsimony—that competing theories explain the data equally well—is unmet. Simplicity itself fragments into conflicting dimensions that yield contradictory verdicts. And the accounts of *why* parsimony works in empirical science do not extend to metaphysical theory choice.

## The Precondition Parsimony Requires

Occam's Razor applies when two theories explain the same data and one is simpler. This is critical: parsimony is a tie-breaker, not a first principle. It arbitrates between theories of *equal explanatory power*.

Physicalism does not explain [phenomenal consciousness](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/). It correlates neural states with experience. It predicts which brain regions activate during which tasks. But it does not explain *why there is something it is like* to undergo those processes. Joseph Levine's [explanatory gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/) (1983) and David Chalmers' hard problem (1996) both identify the same deficit: physical descriptions, however complete, do not entail phenomenal facts. The [knowledge-argument](/concepts/knowledge-argument/) reinforces this point—even complete physical knowledge fails to capture what it is like to have an experience.

Weak reductionists who accept physicalism on parsimony grounds must posit what amounts to a brute identity between neural and phenomenal properties—an unexplained correlation elevated to metaphysical law. As the *Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy* notes in its discussion of identity theory, physicalists who treat mind-brain identity as a brute, unexplained fact face the objection that such identities are "unprecedented in our ontology." A theory that purchases ontological economy by leaving its central explanandum unexplained has not earned the parsimony discount.

The point is not that physicalism fails entirely as a research programme. It is that physicalism and dualism do not explain consciousness equally well, which means the basic precondition for invoking parsimony is unmet. As biologist Kent Holsinger observes, "cases where competing hypotheses explain a phenomenon equally well are comparatively rare" (quoted in Baker 2022, SEP "Simplicity"). The consciousness debate is not one of them.

## Simplicity Is Not One Thing

Even granting that parsimony has some epistemic value, which dimension of simplicity should be weighted? The philosophical literature identifies at least three:

**Ontological parsimony**: fewer kinds of entities. Physicalism scores well here—one substance type rather than two.

**Syntactic simplicity**: fewer or simpler theoretical principles. Here physicalism fares worse. Accommodating consciousness within a physicalist framework requires elaborate theoretical moves—functionalism, higher-order theories, [illusionism](/concepts/illusionism/)—each an alternative attempt to bridge the [explanatory gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/), and each adding substantial theoretical machinery that the base physicalist ontology alone cannot supply.

**Explanatory simplicity**: fewer unexplained brute facts. Dualism posits a non-physical aspect of reality but offers a straightforward account of why consciousness exists: because there is genuinely something non-physical going on. Physicalism must treat the existence of phenomenal experience as a brute fact about physical arrangements—something that just *happens* when matter is configured correctly, with no deeper explanation available.

These dimensions, as the Stanford Encyclopedia notes, "typically pull in different directions." W. V. O. Quine's ontology-ideology trade-off formalises the problem: reducing ontological commitments (fewer entity types) typically inflates ideological complexity (more theoretical apparatus). Physicalism about consciousness is a textbook instance—it achieves ontological economy by adding layers of functional, representational, or higher-order theory to explain away the apparent distinctness of experience.

The quantum interpretation debate illustrates the same fragmentation. Many-Worlds appears axiomatically simpler (no collapse postulate) but is ontologically extravagant (uncountable parallel universes). Copenhagen is ontologically simpler (one universe) but axiomatically richer (collapse as a fundamental process). As Krizek (2017) demonstrates, parsimony "yields contradictory verdicts depending on which dimension of simplicity is weighted." If parsimony cannot settle the interpretation of quantum mechanics, it cannot settle the mind-body problem either.

## Why Scientific Parsimony Doesn't Transfer to Metaphysics

Perhaps the strongest challenge to parsimony arguments against dualism comes from examining *why* parsimony works in science. Michael Huemer (2009) reviewed four contemporary accounts—likelihoodist, curve-fitting, prior probability, and pragmatic—and found that "none of the accounts of the virtue of parsimony extends naturally to either of these philosophical cases" (physicalism and nominalism). This is a striking result: not one of the standard justifications for preferring simpler scientific theories transfers to the domain where physicalists invoke parsimony most aggressively.

Elliott Sober reaches a similar conclusion from a different direction. He argues that "the legitimacy of parsimony stands or falls, in a particular research context, on subject matter specific (and a posteriori) considerations" (2001). There is no global, context-independent justification for preferring simpler theories. Scientific parsimony works because it tracks specific empirical features—avoiding overfitting in statistical models, preferring theories with greater predictive scope. These features are absent from the metaphysical debate about consciousness, where no experiment can distinguish physicalism from property dualism.

Giacomo Zanotti (2021) focuses specifically on the physicalism-dualism case. He challenges the "modesty rationale"—the idea that physicalism is more modest in its ontological commitments and therefore more credible. Zanotti argues that this rationale "does not ultimately favour physicalism over dualism" because the supposed modesty of physicalism depends on background assumptions (about what counts as a genuine ontological commitment) that are themselves part of the dispute.

The convergence is notable. Three independent philosophical investigations—Huemer's analysis of justificatory frameworks, Sober's domain-specificity argument, and Zanotti's targeted critique of modesty—all reach the same conclusion: the scientific credentials of parsimony do not transfer to metaphysical theory choice about consciousness.

## Historical Failures of Parsimony

The history of science provides repeated cases where the simpler theory was wrong:

**Heliocentrism** in its original Copernican form was arguably no simpler than Ptolemy's geocentric model—Copernicus still needed circular orbits and epicycles, and the system's comparative simplicity remains debated among historians of science. The "parsimonious" geocentric model held sway for centuries. Copernicus was vindicated not by simplicity but by later theoretical developments (Kepler's ellipses, Newton's gravity) that reconceptualised what simplicity meant.

**Atomic theory** posited invisible, indivisible particles when continuous matter seemed the simpler hypothesis. Ernst Mach resisted atoms on parsimony grounds into the twentieth century. He was wrong.

**Quantum mechanics** replaced deterministic simplicity with probability amplitudes, superposition, and entanglement—a vastly more complex framework that nevertheless describes reality.

**General relativity** curved spacetime itself rather than keeping flat space with forces. Conceptually extravagant, empirically confirmed.

**Plate tectonics**: extensionist biogeography (organisms crossing land bridges) seemed more parsimonious than continental drift. The more complex geological theory was correct.

These are not isolated exceptions. They cluster at moments when existing conceptual frameworks were inadequate to the domain—when scientists lacked the tools to recognise what was actually simple. Francis Crick, co-discoverer of DNA's structure, warned that "Occam's razor... can be a very dangerous implement in biology" (1988). If parsimony is dangerous in biology, it may be lethal in the philosophy of mind, where the conceptual tools for understanding consciousness may not yet exist.

## The Smart Retraction

One historical episode is particularly instructive. J. J. C. Smart, in his influential 1959 paper "Sensations and Brain Processes," invoked Occam's Razor as a central argument for mind-brain identity theory. The argument attracted immediate criticism and Smart, to his credit, ultimately retracted his advocacy of parsimony as grounds for physicalism. Even Paul Churchland—no friend of dualism—concedes that the simplicity argument is "not a conclusive argument for materialism," since "neither dualism nor materialism can yet explain all the phenomena that need to be explained" (1984). When the philosopher who made the parsimony argument for physicalism famous abandons it, the argument's limitations are hard to deny.

## Relation to Site Perspective

This article directly supports the Map's fifth tenet: [Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits). The tenet states that simplicity is not a reliable guide to truth when knowledge is incomplete. The philosophical literature surveyed here provides the academic foundation for that commitment.

The Map interprets the failure of parsimony arguments as removing what may be the single largest obstacle to taking dualism seriously. Many who find the [hard problem](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/) compelling nevertheless resist dualism because it seems less parsimonious. If the arguments above are sound, this resistance rests on a principle that lacks justification in this domain.

The convergence with [Tenet 4 (No Many Worlds)](/tenets/#no-many-worlds) is also significant. The quantum interpretation debate—where parsimony yields contradictory verdicts depending on the simplicity dimension chosen—mirrors the consciousness debate exactly. In both cases, parsimony partisans help themselves to whichever dimension of simplicity supports their preferred theory. The Map rejects this selective deployment.

The Map does not claim parsimony is useless. It remains a valuable heuristic in empirical science where its preconditions are met—competing theories of genuinely equal explanatory power, subject matter where simplicity has a track record. The claim is narrower and more defensible: parsimony cannot settle the consciousness debate, and invoking it as though it could is an epistemological error.
