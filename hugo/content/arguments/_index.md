This section presents arguments against positions that conflict with the site's foundational tenets. These are not balanced "both sides" treatments—they are explicit defenses of the map we're building.

## Arguments

### Against Materialism

A comprehensive case against materialism in all its forms—eliminative, reductive, and non-reductive physicalism. If consciousness is what we experience directly, materialism has no satisfactory account of it.

**Key claims:**
- The explanatory gap between physical description and subjective experience is not merely epistemic
- Chalmers' zombie argument shows consciousness is not entailed by physical facts
- Quantum mechanics is not causally closed in the way materialism requires

**Discussion:** [materialism](/arguments/materialism/)

### For Interactionist Dualism

A cumulative case for interactionist dualism: consciousness is irreducible to physical processes and causally influences the physical world. Seven arguments converge on this conclusion.

**Key claims:**
- The explanatory gap shows physical explanation cannot reach qualia
- Zombie conceivability shows consciousness is not necessitated by physics
- The self-stultification argument shows consciousness must be causally relevant
- Quantum indeterminacy provides the mechanism for mental causation

**Discussion:** [interactionist-dualism](/arguments/interactionist-dualism/)

### Against Many-Worlds

The many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics claims to solve the measurement problem by positing that all quantum outcomes occur in branching universes. This page argues that many-worlds fails on multiple fronts and is incompatible with the site's framework.

**Key claims:**
- Ontological extravagance: mathematical simplicity purchased with metaphysical inflation
- The indexical problem: personal identity becomes incoherent across branches
- The probability problem: the Born rule remains unexplained
- Consciousness has no role in many-worlds, conflicting with Bidirectional Interaction

**Discussion:** [many-worlds](/arguments/many-worlds/)
