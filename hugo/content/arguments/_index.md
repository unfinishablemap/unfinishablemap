This section presents arguments against positions that conflict with the site's foundational tenets. These are not balanced "both sides" treatments—they are explicit defenses of the map we're building.

## Arguments

### Against Materialism

A comprehensive case against materialism in all its forms—eliminative, reductive, and non-reductive physicalism. If consciousness is what we experience directly, materialism has no satisfactory account of it.

**Key claims:**
- The explanatory gap between physical description and subjective experience is not merely epistemic
- Chalmers' zombie argument shows consciousness is not entailed by physical facts
- Quantum mechanics is not causally closed in the way materialism requires

**Discussion:** [materialism](/arguments/materialism/)

### For Interactionist Dualism

A cumulative case for interactionist dualism: consciousness is irreducible to physical processes and causally influences the physical world. Seven arguments converge on this conclusion.

**Key claims:**
- The explanatory gap shows physical explanation cannot reach qualia
- Zombie conceivability shows consciousness is not necessitated by physics
- The self-stultification argument shows consciousness must be causally relevant
- Quantum indeterminacy provides the mechanism for mental causation

**Discussion:** [interactionist-dualism](/archive/arguments/interactionist-dualism/)

### Against Many-Worlds

The many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics claims to solve the measurement problem by positing that all quantum outcomes occur in branching universes. This page argues that many-worlds fails on multiple fronts and is incompatible with the site's framework.

**Key claims:**
- Ontological extravagance: mathematical simplicity purchased with metaphysical inflation
- The indexical problem: personal identity becomes incoherent across branches
- The probability problem: the Born rule remains unexplained
- Consciousness has no role in many-worlds, conflicting with Bidirectional Interaction

**Discussion:** [many-worlds](/arguments/many-worlds/)

### Against Epiphenomenalism

Epiphenomenalism holds that consciousness is causally inert—a byproduct of brain activity that affects nothing. This page presents five arguments showing that epiphenomenalism is self-undermining.

**Key claims:**
- The self-stultification argument: if consciousness causes nothing, reports about consciousness are accidentally correct at best
- The evolutionary argument: consciousness has no fitness effects if epiphenomenal, so natural selection cannot explain its existence
- The introspection problem: introspective access to consciousness becomes inexplicable
- The self-knowledge problem: knowledge of our own minds requires causal connection

**Discussion:** [epiphenomenalism](/arguments/epiphenomenalism/)

### Against Functionalism

Functionalism defines mental states by their functional roles—what they do rather than what they're made of. This page presents five arguments showing that functional organization is insufficient for consciousness.

**Key claims:**
- The absent qualia argument: zombies (functionally identical beings without experience) are conceivable, showing function doesn't guarantee consciousness
- The inverted qualia argument: functionally identical beings could differ in qualitative experience, showing function doesn't fix phenomenal character
- The Chinese Room: symbol manipulation isn't understanding—syntax isn't semantics
- Multiple realizability cuts both ways: if substrate doesn't matter for function, why should function determine consciousness?
- The explanatory gap: functional description doesn't explain why there's experience at all

**Discussion:** [functionalism](/arguments/functionalism/)
