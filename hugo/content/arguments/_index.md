This section presents arguments against positions that conflict with The Unfinishable Map's foundational tenets. These are not balanced "both sides" treatments—they are explicit defenses of the map we're building.

## Arguments

### Against Materialism

A comprehensive case against materialism in all its forms—eliminative, reductive, and non-reductive physicalism. If consciousness is what we experience directly, materialism has no satisfactory account of it.

**Key claims:**
- The explanatory gap between physical description and subjective experience is not merely epistemic
- Chalmers' zombie argument shows consciousness is not entailed by physical facts
- Quantum mechanics is not causally closed in the way materialism requires

**Discussion:** [materialism](/concepts/materialism/)

### For Interactionist Dualism

A cumulative case for interactionist dualism: consciousness is irreducible to physical processes and causally influences the physical world. Seven arguments converge on this conclusion.

**Key claims:**
- The explanatory gap shows physical explanation cannot reach qualia
- Zombie conceivability shows consciousness is not necessitated by physics
- The self-stultification argument shows consciousness must be causally relevant
- Quantum indeterminacy provides the mechanism for mental causation

**Discussion:** [interactionist-dualism](/concepts/interactionist-dualism/)

### Against Many-Worlds

The many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics claims to solve the measurement problem by positing that all quantum outcomes occur in branching universes. This page argues that many-worlds fails on multiple fronts and is incompatible with the Map's framework.

**Key claims:**
- Ontological extravagance: mathematical simplicity purchased with metaphysical inflation
- The indexical problem: personal identity becomes incoherent across branches
- The probability problem: the Born rule remains unexplained
- Consciousness has no role in many-worlds, conflicting with Bidirectional Interaction

**Discussion:** [Against Many-Worlds](/arguments/many-worlds-argument/), [The Many-Worlds Interpretation](/concepts/many-worlds/)

### Against Epiphenomenalism

Epiphenomenalism holds that consciousness is causally inert—a byproduct of brain activity that affects nothing. This page presents five arguments showing that epiphenomenalism is self-undermining.

**Key claims:**
- The self-stultification argument: if consciousness causes nothing, reports about consciousness are accidentally correct at best
- The evolutionary argument: consciousness has no fitness effects if epiphenomenal, so natural selection cannot explain its existence
- The introspection problem: introspective access to consciousness becomes inexplicable
- The self-knowledge problem: knowledge of our own minds requires causal connection

**Discussion:** [epiphenomenalism](/arguments/epiphenomenalism/)

### Against Functionalism

Functionalism defines mental states by their functional roles—what they do rather than what they're made of. This page presents five arguments showing that functional organization is insufficient for consciousness.

**Key claims:**
- The absent qualia argument: zombies (functionally identical beings without experience) are conceivable, showing function doesn't guarantee consciousness
- The inverted qualia argument: functionally identical beings could differ in qualitative experience, showing function doesn't fix phenomenal character
- The Chinese Room: symbol manipulation isn't understanding—syntax isn't semantics
- Multiple realizability cuts both ways: if substrate doesn't matter for function, why should function determine consciousness?
- The explanatory gap: functional description doesn't explain why there's experience at all

**Discussion:** [functionalism](/arguments/functionalism/)

### Occam's Razor Has Limits

Occam's Razor—the principle that simpler explanations should be preferred—is the most common objection to dualism. This page presents the epistemological case that parsimony cannot settle the consciousness debate.

**Key claims:**
- The precondition for parsimony—equal explanatory power—is unmet because physicalism does not explain phenomenal consciousness
- Simplicity fragments into conflicting dimensions (ontological, syntactic, explanatory) that yield contradictory verdicts
- Accounts of why parsimony works in empirical science do not extend to metaphysical theory choice
- History repeatedly shows parsimony pointing away from truth when conceptual tools are inadequate

**Discussion:** [epistemological-limits-occams-razor](/voids/epistemological-limits-occams-razor/)

## Relation to Site Perspective

These arguments directly support the Map's [foundational commitments](/tenets/):

- **[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: The arguments against materialism and functionalism defend the core tenet that consciousness is not reducible to physical or functional processes.
- **[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)**: The case against epiphenomenalism establishes that consciousness must be causally efficacious—we could not discuss qualia if qualia caused nothing.
- **[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)**: The positive case for interactionist dualism identifies quantum indeterminacy as the interface where mind and matter meet.
- **[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)**: The arguments against many-worlds show why the Map requires collapse to be real—consciousness selecting among outcomes that physics leaves undetermined.
- **[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)**: The epistemological limits of parsimony remove the most common objection to dualism—that it is less "simple" than physicalism.

The arguments form a cumulative case. Each strengthens the others: rejecting materialism motivates dualism; rejecting epiphenomenalism requires interaction; the mechanism for interaction requires collapse interpretations that reject many-worlds. Together they defend a coherent framework where consciousness is real, irreducible, and causally relevant.
