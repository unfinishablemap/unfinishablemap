This section explores unresolved questions arising from the project's foundational tenets. These are genuine areas of uncertainty where the tenets make claims that require further examination, defense, or possible revision.

## Questions

### Does Consciousness Actually Select Neural Patterns?

The bidirectional interaction tenet proposes that consciousness "chooses" which superposed neural firing patterns become actual. But is this mechanism coherent? What evidence supports or challenges it?

**Key concerns:**
- Is there sufficient quantum indeterminacy in neural processes to allow selection?
- How would consciousness access or influence quantum states in warm, wet brains?
- Does this avoid the problems of epiphenomenalism, or merely relocate them?
