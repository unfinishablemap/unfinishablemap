- '[[hard-problem-of-consciousness]]'
---

The knowledge argument, formulated by Frank Jackson (1982, 1986), is one of the most influential arguments against [physicalism](/concepts/materialism/). It uses a thought experiment—Mary's Room—to argue that complete physical knowledge doesn't constitute complete knowledge. Mary, a brilliant scientist who knows every physical fact about color vision, appears to learn something new when she first sees color. If she does learn something new—and the intuition is powerful though contested—what she learns is *what it's like* to see red, a fact that physical knowledge alone could not provide. If sound, the argument shows that non-physical facts exist and physicalism is false. The argument relies on colour [perception](/topics/perception-and-conscious-experience/)—the paradigm case of how conscious experience reveals what physical description leaves out.

This argument directly supports the [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism) tenet and connects to the [explanatory-gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/) literature. It remains actively debated despite its creator's later rejection—a testament to its philosophical force. Its persuasiveness depends significantly on whether the "learning intuition" (that Mary gains new knowledge) is treated as evidential, which is itself a contested methodological question.

## Mary's Room

Mary is a brilliant neuroscientist who has spent her entire life in a black-and-white room. From within this room, she has somehow learned everything physical there is to know about color vision: which wavelengths stimulate which cone cells, how neural signals propagate from retina to cortex, what brain states correlate with color reports, and every other physical fact relevant to seeing colors.

One day, Mary leaves her room and sees a red rose for the first time.

Does she learn something new?

Intuitively, yes. Before leaving, Mary knew what happens in brains when people see red. After leaving, she knows *what it's like* to see red. These seem different. The first is third-person, objective, expressible in equations and diagrams. The second is first-person, subjective, and captures something that no physical description could convey.

But Mary already knew all the physical facts. So if she learns something new, there must be facts beyond the physical facts. If there are facts beyond physical facts, physicalism is false—consciousness is not reducible to physical processes.

## The Argument's Structure

Jackson's argument can be formalized:

1. Mary knows all physical facts about color vision before leaving her room
2. Mary learns something new upon seeing color for the first time
3. Therefore, what Mary learns was not included in the physical facts
4. Therefore, not all facts are physical facts
5. Therefore, physicalism is false

The argument's intuitive force comes largely from premise 2—the "learning claim." Surveys suggest that most people share the intuition that Mary learns something new, and the intuition has powerful psychological grip across diverse populations. However, the evidentiary status of this intuition is itself contested—a methodological question explored in the section on intuition reliability below.

## Physicalist Responses

The argument has generated sophisticated responses, none of which commands consensus.

### The Ability Hypothesis

David Lewis and Laurence Nemirow argue that Mary gains only practical abilities, not propositional knowledge. Upon seeing red, she acquires the ability to imagine, recognize, and remember the experience. These are skills—know-how rather than know-that—and don't require non-physical facts.

The response preserves physicalism: abilities are dispositions of physical systems, not evidence of non-physical reality.

But critics identify fatal problems. Abilities are neither necessary nor sufficient for phenomenal knowledge. Someone without visual imagination could still know what red looks like. And someone could have the imaginative abilities without having had the experience—perhaps through brain stimulation—yet arguably wouldn't have the same knowledge Mary gains. The ability hypothesis fails to capture what makes Mary's learning significant.

### The Phenomenal Concepts Strategy

Brian Loar, David Papineau, and others argue that Mary gains new *concepts*, not new facts. The facts were physical all along; what changes is her mode of access to them. Just as learning that water is H₂O doesn't reveal new stuff (water and H₂O were always the same), Mary gains a new way of representing the same physical facts.

This preserves physicalism by locating the gap in our concepts rather than reality. The same fact can be grasped under physical concepts ("C-fiber activation") or phenomenal concepts ("this reddish feeling").

David Chalmers raises a dilemma—the "master argument" against phenomenal concepts strategy discussed in [phenomenal-concepts-strategy](/concepts/phenomenal-concepts-strategy/). Either phenomenal concepts are themselves physical (in which case [zombies](/concepts/philosophical-zombies/) could have them, contradicting the strategy's claim that experience is needed to acquire them) or they involve something non-physical (conceding dualism).

However, the dilemma's force depends on accepting that zombie conceivability is metaphysically probative—itself a contested assumption. Type-B physicalists like Papineau deny that conceivability tracks possibility, and argue the strategy can reject the dilemma's first horn by denying that zombies are genuinely conceivable. The debate is ongoing: Chalmers's dilemma is serious but not universally regarded as decisive.

### Denying Mary's Knowledge

Daniel Dennett argues that if Mary truly knew all physical facts, she could predict what seeing red would be like. The intuition that she couldn't stems from underestimating what "all physical facts" really means. A complete physical description would include facts about how the brain represents and responds to color—enough to anticipate the experience.

This amounts to denying premise 1: Mary's confinement prevents her from acquiring certain physical knowledge, not just phenomenal knowledge. She can't fully understand brain states she's never had.

But this seems to miss the point. Even if Mary could predict her behavioral responses to red, would she know *what it's like* before seeing it? The qualitative character of the experience seems to require undergoing it, not merely predicting it.

### The Illusionist Response

[Illusionists](/concepts/illusionism/) offer the most radical dismissal: Mary learns nothing substantive because there are no phenomenal facts to learn. What she gains upon leaving is simply a new representational state—a new way her brain models its own processing—not access to some non-physical property. The "learning" intuition reflects our mistaken belief that experience has intrinsic qualitative properties when it doesn't.

Critics deploy the [infinite regress objection](/concepts/illusionism/#regress): if Mary *seems* to learn something, the seeming itself appears phenomenal, and the illusionist must explain it without invoking phenomenal properties. But many philosophers—including Frankish himself—argue this objection is question-begging, since it presupposes that seeming is phenomenal rather than functional. See [the illusionist response](/concepts/illusionism/#illusionist-response) for Frankish's quasi-phenomenal properties account and why the Map finds it ultimately insufficient.

What is specific to Mary's case: the illusionist must explain not just the general seeming of phenomenal consciousness, but the *specific character* of Mary's new experience—why seeing red seems *like that* and not some other way. The learning intuition has force because Mary's situation isolates the phenomenal contribution: she possessed every physical and functional fact, yet something changed. If the change is "merely" a new functional state, the illusionist owes an account of why this particular functional change strikes virtually everyone—including Mary—as revelatory.

## Jackson's Self-Rejection

Frank Jackson, the argument's creator, now rejects it. Beginning around 1995 and fully by 2003, Jackson embraced physicalism. He argues that his original conclusion—epiphenomenalism about qualia—leads to a devastating problem: if qualia have no causal power, we couldn't know about them. The very fact that Mary believes she learned something new suggests that her learning causally affects her beliefs. But epiphenomenal qualia couldn't do this.

Jackson's current view combines representationalism (phenomenal properties are representational properties) with elements of the ability hypothesis.

However, Jackson's rejection doesn't settle the debate. Arguments stand or fall on their logic, not their author's endorsement. Jackson himself has acknowledged the argument "should be addressed really seriously if you are a physicalist." Other philosophers—Chalmers, Nida-Rümelin, Alter—continue to defend it. If anything, Jackson's epiphenomenalism worry supports the [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet: consciousness must causally influence our beliefs about it, or we couldn't know about it at all.

## Connection to Related Arguments

The knowledge argument shares deep structure with other anti-physicalist arguments:

**The Explanatory Gap**: Joseph Levine's [explanatory-gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/) concern is the conceptual counterpart. Mary's Room dramatizes what Levine describes abstractly: physical explanations leave unexplained *why* brain states feel any way at all.

**Conceivability Arguments**: Chalmers connects Mary's Room to [zombie](/concepts/philosophical-zombies/) arguments through two-dimensional semantics. If Mary's phenomenal concepts have different "primary intensions" than any physical concepts, zombies are genuinely conceivable and possibly metaphysical—not merely reflections of human ignorance.

**What Is It Like to Be a Bat?**: Thomas Nagel's earlier argument (1974) anticipated Jackson. Nagel argued that knowing all physical facts about bat echolocation wouldn't tell us what it's *like* to be a bat. Mary's Room makes the same point with human consciousness, strengthening it by eliminating species differences.

**Acquaintance Knowledge**: What Mary gains has been characterized as *acquaintance knowledge*—direct experiential familiarity with a phenomenal quality, distinct from propositional knowledge (knowing-that) or ability knowledge (knowing-how). This illuminates [territories accessible only to conscious beings](/voids/consciousness-only-territories/): regions of knowledge structurally inaccessible to systems lacking phenomenal experience.

**The Objectivity Paradox**: Mary's case exemplifies the broader tension between [objectivity and consciousness](/concepts/objectivity-and-consciousness/). Science aims for the "view from nowhere"—perspective-free description independent of any observer. But consciousness *is* perspective. Mary possessed the maximally objective description of color vision yet lacked the subjective reality it describes. Eliminating the observer eliminates the subject matter.

**The Convergence Argument**: The knowledge argument is not alone. It is one of seven major [arguments against materialism](/concepts/the-case-for-dualism/)—alongside the explanatory gap, zombie argument, inverted qualia, Kripke's modal argument, Nagel's subjectivity argument, and quantum mechanical considerations. These arguments proceed through different logical routes, exploit different features of consciousness, yet converge on the same conclusion. Their convergence provides cumulative support stronger than any individual argument could.

## The Introspection Question

Mary's recognition that she learns something new depends on [introspection](/concepts/introspection/)—her capacity to notice the difference between before and after. This raises a question: might introspective error explain away the intuition?

Critics of introspection argue we routinely confabulate about our mental states. But the relevant findings concern causal *processes*, not phenomenal *content*. Nisbett and Wilson's classic studies show that we lack insight into *why* we choose as we do—not that we misidentify *what* we experience. Mary doesn't need to know why red looks the way it does; she only needs to recognize that her experience has changed qualitatively.

Moreover, contemplative training improves introspective accuracy. Fox et al. (2012) found that meditation experience predicts the ability to detect subtle phenomenal changes—exactly the skill Mary would employ. If introspection were fundamentally unreliable, no amount of practice should help. That training improves accuracy suggests introspection is a skill that can be refined, not a systematically broken faculty.

The introspection objection thus fails on two fronts: it targets the wrong domain (processes, not contents) and it ignores evidence that phenomenal observation can be trained.

## The Reliability of Consciousness Intuitions

The knowledge argument's persuasive force rests heavily on the intuition that Mary learns something new. But philosophers including Dennett, Schwitzgebel, and Machery have argued that intuitions about consciousness are especially unreliable—precisely because consciousness is involved in generating those intuitions.

Several considerations warrant caution:

**Intuitions often fail.** People intuit that the Earth is stationary, that time is absolute, that tiny particles can't be in two places. Neuroscience regularly overturns intuitions about the mind. The force of "surely Mary learns something" may reflect our inability to imagine what "complete physical knowledge" would be like—a cognitive limitation rather than an insight into metaphysics.

**Framing effects.** Philosophical thought experiments are sensitive to how they're presented. The Mary's Room scenario has dramatic features—confinement, release, first experience of color—that may generate an emotional response mistaken for philosophical insight. Whether the intuition survives rigorous depersonalised formulation is debated.

**The experimental philosophy challenge.** While surveys suggest most people share the learning intuition, experimental philosophy has shown that intuitions about other thought experiments (Gettier cases, trolley problems) vary across cultures and demographics. The universality of the Mary intuition deserves more systematic testing than it has received.

The Map treats the learning intuition as strong evidence—but not as near-decisive. If the intuition is reliable, the knowledge argument is powerful. If it reflects cognitive limitations rather than insight into the nature of consciousness, the argument's force diminishes. The honest position is that the intuition's reliability is itself an open question, and the argument is strongest when presented as conditional: *if* Mary genuinely learns something new, *then* physicalism faces a serious challenge.

## Process Philosophy Perspective

Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy offers an alternative framing. For Whitehead, reality consists of "actual occasions"—momentary experiential events that cannot be captured from outside. Physical descriptions characterize the *extensive* relationships between occasions—their spatial and temporal structure—but not their *intensive* reality, the subjective immediacy of each occasion.

On this view, Mary's situation illustrates a general truth: structure never entails experience. Physical science describes patterns of relationship, but the intrinsic nature of what stands in those relationships—what Whitehead calls "subjective form"—remains inaccessible from outside. When Mary sees red, she gains access to the subjective form of a new type of occasion.

This resonates with Bertrand Russell's insight that physics describes structure without revealing intrinsic nature—the [intrinsic-nature-void](/voids/intrinsic-nature-void/) at the heart of physical science. [Russellian monism](/concepts/russellian-monism/) develops this idea—physical science tells us what things *do*, not what they *are*. If this structure/intrinsic-nature distinction holds (and many physicalists contest it, arguing that structure is all there is), Mary's Room dramatizes the resulting void: she possessed complete structural knowledge yet lacked intrinsic knowledge of red. What she gains upon seeing color would be precisely what physics structurally cannot provide.

## What Would Challenge This View?

The knowledge argument would be undermined by any of the following:

1. **Mary predicts correctly**: If someone with only physical knowledge could accurately describe what experiences are like before having them—predicting not just behavior but phenomenal character—this would undermine premise 2. Virtual reality or advanced simulation might someday test whether comprehensive physical knowledge enables accurate phenomenal prediction.

2. **The phenomenal concepts strategy succeeds**: If phenomenal concepts could be shown to be fully physical (including why they require experience for acquisition), the gap between Mary's knowledge states would be merely conceptual. But current versions face Chalmers's dilemma.

3. **Introspection proves systematically unreliable for phenomenal content**: If Mary's report of learning something new could be shown to be confabulation rather than genuine recognition of phenomenal change, the argument's intuitive force would diminish. But the evidence suggests introspection fails for causal processes, not phenomenal content.

4. **Physical completeness is demonstrated**: If a completed physics could derive phenomenal properties the way chemistry derives water's macroscopic properties, the argument would fail. But the explanatory gap shows no sign of closing with increased physical knowledge.

5. **Illusionism is vindicated**: If we could explain why Mary *seems* to learn without invoking phenomenal properties, the argument would lose its force. But the "illusion problem" appears as difficult as the hard problem it replaces.

The argument's resilience comes from its simplicity: minimal assumptions (Mary knows physics, sees color, reports learning) and a modest conclusion (not all facts are physical). If the learning intuition is reliable, the burden falls on physicalists to explain it away. That many trained philosophers find the intuition compelling is significant—though as the section on intuition reliability notes, intuitive force alone does not settle the methodological question.

## Relation to The Unfinishable Map's Perspective

If the knowledge argument is sound, it provides powerful support for the [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism) tenet. The core claim—that physical knowledge leaves phenomenal knowledge unaddressed—aligns with what the Map means by consciousness being irreducible, though the inference from epistemic gap (Mary lacks certain knowledge) to metaphysical distinctness (non-physical facts exist) is contested. [Qualia](/concepts/qualia/) would have a qualitative character that no physical description captures.

The argument also supports the [Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits) tenet. If the learning intuition holds, physicalism's apparent parsimony fails before it. When the "simpler" theory conflicts with what nearly everyone recognizes, simplicity may not be decisive—though as noted, the intuition's reliability is itself debated.

The interaction between Mary's learning and Jackson's epiphenomenalism worry illuminates the [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet. If consciousness were causally inert, Mary couldn't form beliefs about her new experiences. But she does—she reports that seeing red is revelatory. Her phenomenal states causally influence her beliefs. Consciousness isn't just correlated with physical processes; it participates in the causal order.
