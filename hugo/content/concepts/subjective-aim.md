Subjective aim is Alfred North Whitehead's term for the inherent directedness of each actual occasion toward its own completion. Every moment of reality, in Whitehead's [process philosophy](/concepts/process-philosophy/), is not passive matter awaiting external forces but an event actively steering itself toward a definite outcome—what Whitehead called "satisfaction." Subjective aim is what makes each occasion *for itself* rather than merely *there*: it introduces teleology at the most fundamental level of reality.

The Unfinishable Map engages with subjective aim because it provides a metaphysical model for how consciousness could select among possibilities. If every actual occasion already involves self-directed becoming, then consciousness selecting among quantum outcomes in the brain is not a miraculous exception to an otherwise inert universe. It is the most sophisticated expression of a feature pervading reality.

## What Subjective Aim Is

Each actual occasion in Whitehead's ontology undergoes "concrescence"—a process of growing together from indeterminate possibility to definite actuality. The occasion inherits data from its predecessors through [prehension](/concepts/prehension/), entertains abstract possibilities ("eternal objects"), and synthesises these into one unified outcome. Subjective aim is what guides this synthesis. It is the occasion's orientation toward a particular form of satisfaction—the way it shapes its own becoming.

Whitehead distinguished the *initial* subjective aim from the *modified* subjective aim. The initial aim derives from what Whitehead called God (a technical term in his system meaning the ordering of abstract possibilities, not a personal deity). As the occasion develops, it modifies this initial aim through its own creative process, introducing genuine novelty. The final aim—what the occasion actually becomes—reflects both inherited constraint and creative self-determination.

Subjective aim is not conscious deliberation. Most actual occasions (electrons, molecules, simple organisms) have subjective aim in only the most attenuated sense—a minimal directedness toward their own satisfaction. Human consciousness represents the extreme case: highly complex occasions with rich subjective aims involving reflection, imagination, and deliberate choice.

## Subjective Aim and Value

Whitehead held that subjective aim is always aim toward *intensity of experience*—the richest possible integration of an occasion's data consistent with harmony. Value is not imposed on occasions from outside but is constitutive of what they are. Each occasion aims at the best it can achieve given its circumstances.

This has consequences for understanding purpose. As the Map's [purpose and alignment](/topics/purpose-and-alignment/) article develops: human purpose is not an external goal to be discovered or constructed but the ongoing subjective aim of each moment of experience toward maximal intensity and harmony. Purpose is *in* experience, not something experience serves.

The [experiential-alignment](/concepts/experiential-alignment/) concept draws on this insight. If each occasion aims at experiential intensity—integrating hedonic, aesthetic, meaning, agency, and other value dimensions—then alignment is not arbitrary preference but reflects the deep structure of experiential becoming. The [phenomenal value realism](/concepts/phenomenal-value-realism/) framework extends this further: values are grounded in phenomenal experience itself, not projected onto a value-neutral world.

## Subjective Aim and Selection

The concept most directly relevant to the Map's framework is the connection between subjective aim and the selection of outcomes.

For Whitehead, each actual occasion involves "decision"—literally a cutting-off (*de-cidere*) of alternatives. The occasion begins with multiple possibilities inherited from its predecessors and entertained through conceptual prehension. Subjective aim determines which possibilities are actualised and which are negatively prehended (excluded). This is selection at the metaphysical level: not random resolution of indeterminacy but directed self-determination.

The parallel to [consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns](/questions/consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns/) is structural. In the Map's framework, the brain presents superposed quantum possibilities; consciousness selects which becomes actual. In Whitehead's framework, each occasion inherits data and possibilities; subjective aim determines which achieve satisfaction. Both involve directed selection where prior conditions are necessary but not sufficient to determine the outcome.

Henry Stapp developed this parallel explicitly. He proposed that the "Heisenberg choice" (which observable to measure) and the "Dirac choice" (which outcome occurs) are the modern physics counterpart to Whitehead's subjective aim and satisfaction. For Stapp, quantum mechanics provides the mathematical structure for what process philosophy describes conceptually: reality involves irreducible moments of self-determination.

## Subjective Aim and Agency

The [agent-causation](/concepts/agent-causation/) concept holds that conscious agents originate actions directly, not through prior event chains. Subjective aim provides metaphysical grounding for this claim. If every actual occasion steers its own becoming, then agency is not a mysterious exception requiring special pleading but a sophisticated instance of a universal feature.

Whitehead: "Apart from the experiences of subjects there is nothing, nothing, nothing, bare nothingness" (*Process and Reality*, p. 167). The directedness of subjective aim means that actuality is inherently agentive. There is no inert substrate upon which agency must somehow be superimposed. The question shifts from "How can consciousness possibly cause anything?" to "Why did we think causation could be entirely non-experiential?"

This supports the Map's [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet. If all actuality involves self-directed becoming, consciousness influencing physical outcomes is not anomalous but exemplary.

## Criticisms

Subjective aim faces objections both from within and outside process philosophy.

**Anthropomorphism**: Critics charge that attributing "aim" to electrons and molecules is illegitimate projection of human psychology onto fundamental physics. Whitehead anticipated this objection, insisting that low-level occasions have subjective aim only in an attenuated sense—nothing like human intention. But the question remains: does "attenuated aim" differ from no aim at all, or is it a verbal manoeuvre that conflates two fundamentally different things?

**Empirical vacuity**: Subjective aim generates no distinctive empirical predictions. An electron with subjective aim behaves identically to one without. The concept's value is metaphysical—offering a framework where consciousness is natural rather than anomalous—not empirical. Whether metaphysical illumination without empirical consequences constitutes genuine explanation is debated.

**The combination problem**: If fundamental occasions have subjective aims, how do many simple aims combine into the unified, complex aims of human consciousness? This is a specific form of the [combination problem](/concepts/combination-problem/) that faces all panpsychist positions. Whitehead's answer—that "personally ordered societies" of occasions inherit aims with special intimacy—is contested. The transition from molecular-level directedness to conscious deliberation remains inadequately explained.

**Teleology without mechanism**: Subjective aim introduces teleology (goal-directedness) at the fundamental level without specifying how this teleology operates physically. The Map's quantum selection framework at least identifies *where* consciousness might intervene (quantum indeterminacies). Process philosophy's subjective aim identifies *what* is happening (self-directed becoming) without specifying how this relates to physical law.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Subjective aim intersects with the Map's tenets in illuminating but also tensional ways.

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: The Map holds that consciousness is distinct from physical processes. Whitehead denies this distinction—subjective aim is present in all actuality, not just in conscious beings. The Map can use subjective aim as a model for how directed selection works without endorsing Whitehead's panpsychist conclusion. Human consciousness may be the only locus where subjective aim rises to genuine awareness and deliberate selection, while the metaphysical structure Whitehead identifies (self-directed becoming) illuminates what selection involves.

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)**: Subjective aim provides a process-philosophical description of what the Map proposes physically: consciousness guiding outcomes where physics leaves them undetermined. Concrescence parallels quantum collapse; subjective aim parallels the selective role of consciousness. The concepts operate at different levels of description—metaphysical and physical—but point in the same direction.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)**: This is where subjective aim most directly supports the Map. Every occasion's self-directed becoming means experience makes a causal difference. The Map restricts this to conscious beings interacting with quantum indeterminacies; Whitehead generalises it to all actuality. Both agree that experience is causally efficacious.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)**: Subjective aim presupposes definite outcomes. The occasion aims at satisfaction and achieves it—one outcome, not branching alternatives. If all possibilities were equally real (as in many-worlds), subjective aim would be otiose: there would be nothing to aim at, since every outcome is actualised somewhere.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)**: Whitehead's framework is elaborate. Subjective aim, concrescence, prehension, eternal objects—this is not a parsimonious ontology. But if reality genuinely involves self-directed experiential becoming, no simpler framework can capture it. The apparent simplicity of materialism is purchased by ignoring what subjective aim makes central: the directedness of experience.
