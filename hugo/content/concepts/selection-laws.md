Selection laws are fundamental principles specifying how conscious states influence which physical outcomes become actual. They constitute the *downward* direction of [psychophysical-laws](/concepts/psychophysical-laws/)—the direction The Unfinishable Map's [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet requires. While supervenience laws run upward (physical states → experiences), selection laws run downward (conscious states → physical selections).

The distinction matters because most philosophical work on psychophysical laws has focused on the upward direction. Chalmers asks: given these neurons, what experience accompanies them? The Map must also ask the inverse: given this intention or attention, what physical outcome does it select?

## The Asymmetry Problem

David Chalmers developed the canonical framework for [psychophysical-laws](/concepts/psychophysical-laws/), arguing that consciousness requires new fundamental laws bridging phenomenal and physical domains. His three principles—structural coherence, organizational invariance, and double-aspect information—primarily address how physical configurations produce experiences.

This creates an asymmetry. Chalmers' naturalistic dualism can accommodate [epiphenomenalism](/arguments/epiphenomenalism/)—the view that experience accompanies physical processes without causally affecting them. Supervenience laws alone don't require that consciousness makes a difference.

The Map cannot accept this asymmetry. If consciousness is causally inert, our beliefs *about* consciousness would be causally disconnected from consciousness itself. We'd be accidentally right about our experiences at best. The Bidirectional Interaction tenet commits the Map to genuine downward causation—and selection laws are what make that causation precise.

Functionalists respond that mental reports can track mental states without requiring downward causation—the tracking is mediated by functional organization, not phenomenal properties causing physical effects. But this response faces the hard problem: functional organization doesn't explain *why* there is something it is like to be in these states. If phenomenal properties are real and distinct from functional properties (as the Map holds), and our reports are accurate about those phenomenal properties, then phenomenal properties must causally influence reports. The functionalist can deny the distinctness, but that returns us to the hard problem's core challenge.

## What Selection Laws Must Specify

A complete selection law would answer:

**1. Mental variables**: Which aspects of conscious experience map to selection? Candidates include:
- Attention (where focus is directed)
- Intention (what action is willed)
- Effort (how much mental work is exerted)
- Valence (felt goodness or badness)

**2. Physical variables**: Which physical parameters does consciousness influence? Candidates include:
- Quantum measurement rate (Stapp)
- Probability distributions over outcomes (Eccles)
- Measurement basis selection
- Collapse timing

**3. Bandwidth constraints**: How much selection can consciousness accomplish per unit time? Research suggests conscious processing operates at approximately 10 bits per second—sharply limiting selection to coarse-grained choices (action patterns, not individual neurons).

**4. Scope constraints**: What is *not* selectable? External quantum systems, others' brains, events outside attention—selection operates through the brain's representational interface.

Without answers to these questions, "consciousness selects" remains metaphorical rather than scientific.

## Why Quantum Selection?

Selection laws naturally locate at quantum indeterminacies. Classical physics is deterministic—if physics fixes the outcome, there's no room for consciousness to determine anything. Quantum mechanics provides probability distributions without determining specific outcomes. That gap is where selection laws operate.

This connects to the [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) tenet: consciousness biases which of several quantum-mechanically possible outcomes becomes actual, without violating conservation laws or injecting energy. The selection is minimal—the smallest deviation from standard physics that permits downward causation.

## Candidate Selection Laws

The [psychophysical-coupling](/psychophysical-coupling/) article evaluates five candidate mechanisms. Two have developed implementations:

### Attention as Observation Rate (Stapp)

Henry Stapp's quantum Zeno model connects attention to selection: conscious attention increases the rate of quantum observations on neural systems, "freezing" desired patterns via the Zeno effect. The phenomenology of effort—sustaining attention against distraction requires work—maps to the physical work of maintaining high observation rates.

**Selection law**: Attention intensity → observation frequency → pattern stability.

### Intention as Probability Weighting (Eccles)

John Eccles proposed that intention modulates quantum tunneling probability in neurotransmitter release. The brain prepares action possibilities; consciousness biases which patterns dominate.

**Selection law**: Intention strength → vesicle release probability → action selection.

Three other candidates—valence, qualia, and phenomenal unity—lack developed mechanisms specifying how the mental variable connects to physical selection.

## Selection Laws vs. Supervenience Laws

| Feature | Supervenience Laws | Selection Laws |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| Direction | Upward (physics → experience) | Downward (experience → physics) |
| Input | Physical state | Conscious state |
| Output | Phenomenal state | Which physical outcome actualizes |
| Compatible with epiphenomenalism? | Yes | No |
| Developed by | Chalmers (extensively) | Stapp, Eccles (partially) |

The Map needs both. Supervenience laws explain why brain states are accompanied by experiences. Selection laws explain how those experiences causally participate in determining what happens next.

## The Specification Problem

A persistent challenge: no known compact formula captures selection laws the way F=ma captures force. Schaffer calls this the "t-shirt problem"—we lack an elegant, systematizable relationship.

Three responses are available:

**Scientific immaturity**: Physics took centuries to reach F=ma. Consciousness science is young.

**Cognitive closure**: Perhaps the laws involve concepts our minds aren't built to grasp—not because they don't exist, but because our evolutionary history didn't require us to understand them.

**Piecemeal progress**: Specific mechanisms (Stapp's attention-observation coupling, Eccles' intention-probability coupling) may provide testable predictions even without grand unification.

What's not acceptable: using specification difficulty as license for unfalsifiable speculation. If selection laws provide no constraints, they lose scientific status.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Selection laws are where the Map's tenets become operationally precise.

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)** requires that mental and physical are distinct variables—otherwise there's nothing for a selection law to relate. The selection law specifies the lawful connection between distinct domains.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)** most directly requires selection laws. Supervenience laws alone don't suffice—consciousness must causally influence outcomes, and selection laws specify how.

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)** constrains which selection laws are admissible. Consciousness biases quantum outcomes without violating conservation. The ~10 bits/second bandwidth further constrains the channel.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)** means selection laws govern genuine collapse. Consciousness selects what becomes *actually* true, not which branch contains "this" observer. If many-worlds were correct, selection laws would collapse to supervenience laws plus indexical uncertainty.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)** justifies the ontological commitment. Adding selection laws seems less parsimonious than physicalism. But a theory that ignores robust data isn't genuinely simpler—it's inadequate. If consciousness is causally efficacious, selection laws are necessary completions of our picture.

Selection laws also bear on [free-will](/concepts/free-will/). If consciousness selects among physically underdetermined alternatives, this provides a mechanism for [agent-causation](/concepts/agent-causation/)—genuine authorship of choices that isn't mere randomness. The selection isn't arbitrary; it reflects the agent's intentions and attention. This connects the metaphysics of consciousness to the metaphysics of agency.

## What Would Challenge This View?

Selection laws would face serious difficulty if:

1. **Epiphenomenalism proves defensible.** If a comprehensive account shows consciousness can be causally inert without self-undermining, selection laws become unnecessary.

2. **Quantum mechanisms prove unavailable.** If decoherence in neural tissue is so complete that no indeterminacy survives at relevant scales, quantum selection laws lose their physical basis.

3. **Many-worlds is confirmed.** If MWI is vindicated, all outcomes occur. "Selection" becomes mere indexical uncertainty—we didn't select which branch, we just find ourselves in one.

4. **Illusionism succeeds.** If the illusion of consciousness can be explained without invoking phenomenal properties, there's nothing for selection laws to connect.

None of these currently succeeds, but they mark conditions under which the framework would need revision.

**Empirical tests**: The framework makes indirect predictions. If selection is real, willed attention should differ from instructed or reflexive attention in neural signatures—a difference some contemplative neuroscience studies suggest exists. Meditation training should increase pattern stability in attention networks. The ~10 bits/second bandwidth should appear as a measurable constraint on conscious processing independent of sensory bandwidth. These predictions aren't definitive—functionalist accounts could explain the same data—but consistent failure across multiple tests would weaken the case.
