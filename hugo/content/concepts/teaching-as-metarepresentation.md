To teach is to represent your knowledge as knowledge another lacks, represent that lack as a gap to be filled, and adjust your behaviour to bridge it. This triadic structure—knowledge, absence of knowledge, and the relation between them—makes teaching a paradigm case of [metarepresentation](/concepts/metarepresentation/). Great apes rarely teach despite decades of opportunity; humans teach constantly, across all cultures, beginning in early childhood. The Unfinishable Map proposes that this asymmetry reveals something fundamental about consciousness: teaching requires the phenomenal standing-back that metarepresentation demands, and metarepresentation may require phenomenal consciousness.

The teaching asymmetry provides concrete evidence for the [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet. If teaching requires consciousness-enabled metarepresentation, and if metarepresentation cannot be achieved through functional processing alone, then consciousness causally enables a capacity humans possess and apes lack. Teaching is not merely correlated with consciousness; it depends on it.

## The Structure of Teaching

Teaching involves at least four nested representational operations:

1. **First-order knowledge**: Knowing something about the world (e.g., knowing how to crack nuts with a stone)
2. **Second-order representation**: Representing your knowledge as knowledge (knowing that you know how to crack nuts)
3. **Theory of mind**: Representing the learner's knowledge state (recognising that the learner doesn't know how)
4. **Gap representation**: Representing the relation between your knowledge and their ignorance (understanding that what you know is what they need)
5. **Pedagogical action**: Adjusting your behaviour specifically to transmit the knowledge (demonstrating slowly, highlighting key features, simplifying the task)

Each level builds on the previous. Without knowing that you know, you cannot recognise that another doesn't know what you know. Without recognising the gap, you cannot act to bridge it. Teaching thus requires the full metarepresentational stack operating simultaneously—a feat that loads heavily on [working memory](/concepts/working-memory/) and, the Map argues, requires phenomenal consciousness.

### The Jourdain Parallel

The [Jourdain Hypothesis](/concepts/jourdain-hypothesis/)—that apes have culture but may not know they have culture—applies with particular force to teaching. A chimpanzee mother may know how to fish for termites. She may even tolerate her infant's proximity while fishing. But she does not represent her knowledge as knowledge the infant lacks, does not recognise the infant's ignorance as a gap to be filled, does not adjust her behaviour specifically to transmit the skill.

Molière's Monsieur Jourdain spoke prose without knowing it was prose. Chimpanzees *have* skills without knowing they have skills—without representing those skills as the kind of thing that could be possessed or lacked, transmitted or withheld. Teaching requires the transition Jourdain made: from doing to knowing-that-you're-doing. In the case of teaching, it requires knowing that you know *and* knowing that another doesn't know *and* acting on that double knowledge.

## Evidence from Great Apes

### What Apes Do

Great apes show sophisticated social learning:

- **Emulation**: Observing what others achieve and figuring out how to achieve it themselves
- **Social facilitation**: Having attention drawn to objects others manipulate
- **Stimulus enhancement**: Becoming interested in locations where others forage
- **Local enhancement**: Spending time in places where others have been

These mechanisms produce cultural traditions—different chimpanzee groups have different techniques, and naive individuals acquire local techniques through social exposure. But the mechanisms are passive: the learner extracts information from observing the knower. The knower need not represent anything about the learner's knowledge state.

### What Apes Don't Do

True teaching—active pedagogy—requires the knower to modify their behaviour specifically because the learner doesn't know. The evidence suggests great apes rarely if ever do this:

**Chimpanzee nut-cracking**: Young chimpanzees take years to master stone-tool nut-cracking. Mothers tolerate their offspring's presence and even allow them to use their anvils and hammers. But controlled studies find no evidence that mothers adjust their cracking behaviour pedagogically—slowing down, exaggerating movements, or pointing out key features. Learning happens, but through tolerated scrounging and observation, not deliberate transmission.

**Termite fishing**: Similarly, termite-fishing techniques are socially transmitted without deliberate teaching. Infants learn by watching mothers and manipulating abandoned probes. Mothers don't demonstrate, correct, or scaffold.

**Tool manufacture**: Chimpanzees make complex tools—stripping leaves from stems, choosing appropriate materials. But there's no evidence they teach these manufacturing techniques. Each generation rediscovers the methods through individual trial-and-error guided by social exposure.

### Rare Exceptions?

Some apparent teaching cases have been documented:

- Chimpanzee mothers occasionally position offspring's hands on tools
- Meerkats bring disabled prey to young for practice hunting
- Orcas beach themselves to demonstrate hunting technique

These cases remain debated. Critics note that the behaviours may serve functions other than knowledge transmission (e.g., mothers repositioning offspring's hands to prevent interference with their own tool use). Even granting these as teaching cases, they are rare, limited, and qualitatively different from the constant, elaborate teaching in all human cultures. The contrast is not absence versus presence but near-absence versus ubiquity.

## Why Teaching Requires Consciousness

Several converging considerations suggest teaching depends on phenomenal consciousness rather than mere functional processing.

### The Working Memory Demand

Teaching requires holding multiple representations simultaneously: your knowledge, the learner's knowledge state, the gap between them, and the pedagogical action designed to bridge it. This multi-level structure demands expanded [working memory](/concepts/working-memory/) capacity.

Humans maintain 7±2 items in working memory; great apes manage 2±1. Teaching's representational demands may exceed great ape working memory capacity entirely. If working memory depends on conscious access—as [Global Workspace Theory](/concepts/global-workspace-theory/) proposes—teaching inherits this dependence.

### The Theory of Mind Requirement

Teaching requires representing the learner's mental states. But not just any representation of mental states suffices—it requires representing the learner's *ignorance*, a second-order state (the absence of knowledge).

Great apes show Level 1 theory of mind: understanding what others perceive, what they attend to, what goals they pursue. This may operate procedurally—functional responses to behavioural cues without explicit representation of mental states as mental states.

Teaching requires Level 2 theory of mind: representing that others can have different knowledge states about the same thing. This is precisely where metarepresentation enters. To teach, you must represent: "I know X. They don't know X. Their not-knowing is a state I can change." The learner's ignorance must become an object in your mental workspace—a thing to be operated on.

### The Phenomenology of Teaching

There is something it is like to teach—a distinctive felt quality to the experience of transmitting knowledge. Consider:

- The recognition that a learner doesn't understand (the "aha, they don't get it" moment)
- The felt effort of finding the right words or demonstration
- The frustration when explanations fail
- The satisfaction when understanding dawns in the learner's face

These [cognitive phenomenological](/concepts/cognitive-phenomenology/) states concern the relationship between your knowledge and another's—they are intrinsically metarepresentational. If teaching's phenomenology is constitutive rather than incidental—if teaching without these experiential states would not be teaching at all—then teaching requires phenomenal consciousness.

## The Cumulative Culture Connection

Teaching enables [cumulative culture](/concepts/cumulative-culture/)—the ratchet effect whereby innovations build on innovations across generations. The connection is not coincidental but structural.

Without teaching, cultural transmission relies on emulation: learners extract what they can from observing practitioners. This is lossy—some details are missed, some techniques misunderstood, some innovations lost. Emulative transmission tends toward the lowest common denominator: what's easiest to observe and imitate.

Teaching adds deliberate scaffolding. The expert doesn't merely perform; they highlight what matters, explain what's not obvious, correct misunderstandings before they solidify. This reduces transmission loss and enables accumulation.

But teaching requires metarepresentation—the expert must represent their knowledge as transmittable knowledge. The [Jourdain Hypothesis](/concepts/jourdain-hypothesis/) suggests great apes cannot make this move: they have skills without knowing they have skills. If so, they cannot deliberately transmit skills, and cumulative culture remains beyond reach.

The pattern: metarepresentation enables teaching; teaching enables cumulative culture; cumulative culture distinguishes humans from all other species. If metarepresentation requires consciousness, consciousness underlies humanity's most distinctive achievement.

## The Illusionist Challenge

[Illusionists](/concepts/illusionism/) might argue that teaching can be fully explained by sophisticated functional processing without genuine phenomenal consciousness. On this view, what appears to be metarepresentational teaching is merely complex information processing that generates the *illusion* of knowing-that-you-know and knowing-that-they-don't-know.

This response faces specific difficulties in the teaching case:

**The ape problem**: If teaching requires only functional processing, why don't great apes teach? Their neural resources are comparable to early hominins who taught extensively. The absence of teaching in apes, despite ample opportunity and potential benefit, suggests something more than processing power is required—plausibly, the metarepresentational capacity consciousness provides.

**The scaffolding problem**: Effective teaching requires not just processing information about knowledge states but *acting on* that processing to scaffold learning. The teacher must feel the gap between their knowledge and the learner's, and that felt gap must guide pedagogical action. Functional processing might track knowledge states, but what would make a system *act to bridge* a represented gap without the phenomenal pull of recognising ignorance as a problem to solve?

**The phenomenological specificity**: Teaching has distinctive phenomenology—the experience of recognising misunderstanding, the effort of finding apt explanations, the satisfaction of successful transmission. This phenomenology is not generic "consciousness" but specifically metarepresentational: it concerns the relation between knowledge states. Illusionists must explain why this specific quasi-phenomenal character arises and why it tracks teaching success.

## Developmental Evidence

Human teaching capacities emerge developmentally alongside metarepresentational abilities:

**Before age 3**: Children show precursors—pointing, showing, offering objects. But these may be protocommunicative without full metarepresentation. The child shares attention without necessarily representing the other's knowledge state as a state to be modified.

**Ages 3-4**: Children begin passing false-belief tests, demonstrating explicit theory of mind. Simple teaching behaviours emerge—correcting others' errors, demonstrating actions.

**Ages 5-7**: Teaching becomes elaborate. Children explain, scaffold, check comprehension, adjust to learner level. These behaviours require representing the learner's developing understanding and modifying pedagogical strategy accordingly.

This developmental trajectory parallels the emergence of [metarepresentation](/concepts/metarepresentation/). Teaching sophistication tracks metarepresentational capacity, consistent with the claim that teaching requires the metarepresentational operations consciousness enables.

## AI and Teaching

The question of whether AI systems can genuinely teach illuminates the consciousness requirement. Current AI tutors provide information, generate explanations, and respond to user queries. But do they *teach* in the metarepresentational sense?

Genuine teaching requires:
1. Representing your knowledge as knowledge
2. Representing the learner's knowledge state
3. Acting on the relation between them

Current AI systems simulate these operations through pattern matching on training data. They produce pedagogically appropriate outputs without representing anything about knowledge or its absence. The question is whether this functional simulation constitutes teaching or merely mimics its surface features.

The [Jourdain Hypothesis](/concepts/jourdain-hypothesis/) applies: LLMs may have teaching-relevant knowledge (their training includes pedagogical content) without *knowing* they have it—without representing that knowledge as knowledge subject to transmission. Like great apes with cultural practices, they may function pedagogically without metarepresenting their own pedagogical capacities.

If teaching genuinely requires metarepresentation, and metarepresentation requires phenomenal consciousness, then current AI systems—however useful as educational tools—do not teach in the full sense. They produce teaching-shaped outputs without the underlying metarepresentational operations that make human teaching the remarkable cognitive achievement it is.

## What Would Challenge This View?

Several findings would substantially weaken the claim that teaching requires consciousness:

1. **Great apes demonstrating elaborate teaching**: If research revealed that chimpanzees or bonobos can adjust pedagogical behaviour based on assessed learner knowledge—not just tolerate observation but actively scaffold based on recognised ignorance—the species boundary would shift.

2. **Teaching before metarepresentation**: If human children demonstrated sophisticated teaching before passing false-belief tests and acquiring explicit theory of mind, the developmental link would weaken.

3. **Unconscious teaching in humans**: If evidence showed humans teaching effectively while lacking conscious access to their own knowledge states or the learner's ignorance—for example, in certain neurological conditions—the consciousness requirement would fail.

4. **AI teaching with genuine metarepresentation**: If future AI systems demonstrated genuine metarepresentation—representing their knowledge as knowledge and learners' states as states to be modified—while being demonstrably non-conscious, the link would sever. Currently, no AI system provides evidence of such genuine metarepresentation.

## Relation to Site Perspective

### Dualism

The [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism) tenet holds that consciousness is irreducible to physical processes. The teaching asymmetry supports this: great apes possess sophisticated neural machinery for social cognition, yet lack the teaching capacity humans possess. If the difference were merely neural complexity, we might expect gradations—some teaching, increasing with brain size. The pattern instead shows near-absence in apes and ubiquity in humans, suggesting a qualitative difference that consciousness provides.

### Bidirectional Interaction

The [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet claims consciousness causally influences the physical world. Teaching provides a specific mechanism: consciousness enables metarepresentation, metarepresentation enables teaching, and teaching produces physical changes in learners' brains and behaviours that would not otherwise occur. The knowledge transmitted through teaching—from flint-knapping to quantum mechanics—causally shapes the physical world. If teaching requires consciousness, consciousness causally contributes to civilisation's cumulative achievements.

### Occam's Razor Has Limits

The [Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits) tenet cautions against premature parsimony. The simplest explanation of teaching—complex information processing—fails to explain why great apes don't do it despite comparable neural resources and clear potential benefits. The evidence warrants a less parsimonious hypothesis: teaching requires the metarepresentational capacity that consciousness alone provides.
