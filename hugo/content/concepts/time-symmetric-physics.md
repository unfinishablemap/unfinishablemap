Time-symmetric physics refers to the property of fundamental physical laws working equally well when run backward in time. The Schrödinger equation, Maxwell's equations, and general relativity are all time-reversal invariant—given any solution, reversing the direction of time produces another valid solution. This symmetry has profound implications: if fundamental physics doesn't distinguish past from future, the apparent "arrow of time" we experience must emerge from something other than basic physical law.

For The Unfinishable Map, time-symmetry matters because it grounds [retrocausal](/concepts/retrocausality/) interpretations of quantum mechanics. If physics is fundamentally time-symmetric, causation need not flow only forward. This opens logical space for consciousness to participate in determining outcomes even when neural activity appears to precede conscious awareness—the selection needn't be located at a moment but can constrain which correlations hold across time.

## T-Symmetry in Fundamental Physics

### Classical Mechanics

Newton's laws are time-symmetric. If you film a billiard ball collision and run the film backward, the reversed sequence obeys the same laws of motion. Momentum and energy conservation work identically in both directions. Classical mechanics provides no fundamental distinction between past and future.

### Electromagnetism

Maxwell's equations admit both "retarded" solutions (waves propagating outward from sources) and "advanced" solutions (waves converging on absorbers). Physics textbooks typically discard advanced solutions as unphysical, but this is a choice, not a derivation. Wheeler and Feynman's absorber theory (1945) showed that combining retarded and advanced waves produces the same predictions as the standard retarded-only formulation—the arrow of electromagnetic radiation may emerge from boundary conditions rather than fundamental law.

### Quantum Mechanics

The Schrödinger equation is time-symmetric—replace *t* with *−t* and the equation remains valid (with complex conjugation). Quantum field theory respects CPT symmetry: physics is invariant under the combined operation of charge conjugation (C), parity inversion (P), and time reversal (T). Individual operations may be violated (CP violation occurs in weak interactions), but CPT as a whole holds.

The apparent asymmetry enters through [measurement](/concepts/measurement-problem/). Before measurement: superposition. After: definite outcome. This transition—if real—breaks time-symmetry. But whether measurement involves genuine collapse or merely appears to is precisely what quantum interpretation debates contest.

### Gravity

Einstein's equations are time-symmetric. Run general relativity backward and you get valid solutions. Black holes have time-reversed counterparts ("white holes") that eject matter rather than absorbing it. That we observe black holes but not white holes reflects initial conditions, not fundamental asymmetry.

## Where Does the Arrow Come From?

If fundamental laws are time-symmetric, what produces the apparent direction of time?

### Thermodynamic Arrow

The second law of thermodynamics—entropy increases over time—provides the most discussed arrow. But this law is statistical, not fundamental. It follows from the Past Hypothesis: the universe began in an extraordinarily low-entropy state. Given that starting point, entropy almost certainly increases toward the future simply because there are vastly more high-entropy configurations than low-entropy ones.

This doesn't derive time's arrow from physics—it assumes it by specifying asymmetric initial conditions. Why the universe began in low entropy remains unexplained.

### Cosmological Arrow

The universe expands rather than contracts. This cosmological arrow might connect to the thermodynamic arrow (expansion allows entropy increase), but it too traces to initial conditions rather than fundamental law.

### Psychological Arrow

We remember the past, not the future. We can affect the future, not the past (or so it seems). This psychological arrow might reduce to the thermodynamic arrow—memory requires physical records, which require entropy increase.

### Quantum Arrow

Does measurement introduce a fundamental arrow? This is interpretation-dependent:

- **Collapse realism**: Collapse is genuinely irreversible—superposition becomes definite outcome. This introduces objective temporal asymmetry.
- **Decoherence**: Apparent collapse is entanglement with environment. The underlying evolution remains unitary (reversible); irreversibility is thermodynamic.
- **Many-worlds**: No collapse occurs. The wave function evolves unitarily forever. Apparent asymmetry is branching structure.
- **Time-symmetric interpretations**: Measurement involves constraints at both past and future. The asymmetry emerges perspectivally.

## Time-Symmetric Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics

### Transactional Interpretation

John Cramer's transactional interpretation (1986) takes time-symmetry seriously. Quantum events involve:

- **Offer waves**: Propagating forward from emitter to absorber
- **Confirmation waves**: Propagating backward from absorber to emitter

A "transaction" completes when offer and confirmation waves match. The definite outcome doesn't occur at a moment—it's the satisfaction of constraints across the entire interaction. From within time, we see measurement at a particular instant. But the transaction itself is atemporal.

Ruth Kastner's possibilist transactional interpretation (2012) refines this: offer waves represent real possibilities; transactions actualise one. The "future" sending confirmation waves isn't an already-existing timeline but the possibility structure of potential absorbers.

### Two-State Vector Formalism

Aharonov, Bergmann, and Lebowitz (1964) developed the Two-State Vector Formalism (TSVF). Complete physical description of a quantum system requires both:

- A forward-evolving state vector (from initial preparation)
- A backward-evolving state vector (from final post-selection)

Neither vector alone provides complete information. Weak measurements—gentle probes that don't fully collapse the system—can reveal "weak values" inaccessible to standard measurement. These weak values can lie outside the eigenvalue spectrum, suggesting that the backward-evolving vector contributes genuine physical content.

TSVF makes [retrocausality](/concepts/retrocausality/) mathematically explicit rather than interpretively optional. The formalism works; whether to take its retrocausal implications seriously is a philosophical choice.

### Price's Argument

Philosopher Huw Price argues that if physics is time-symmetric and causal, retrocausality follows necessarily. We accept that past causes constrain future states. Time-symmetry means future states equally constrain past. Resistance to backward causation reflects cognitive bias—our evolved perspective as forward-moving agents—not physical principle.

A common objection distinguishes mathematical symmetry from causal symmetry: equations may work equally well in both directions, but causation might be fundamentally forward-pointing. Price's response is that this asymmetric causation must then be justified—and physics provides no such justification. The causal arrow, if it exists, would be imposed on physics, not derived from it.

Price's argument doesn't require accepting retrocausality in all contexts. It establishes that rejecting retrocausality requires either denying time-symmetry (which physics doesn't support) or denying that physics is causal in the relevant sense.

## Why Time-Symmetry Matters for Consciousness

### The Libet Problem

[Benjamin Libet's experiments](/concepts/libet-experiments/) (1983) showed that neural "readiness potentials" precede conscious awareness of deciding by hundreds of milliseconds. If causation runs only forward, consciousness appears to arrive too late to cause the brain activity it supposedly controls.

Time-symmetric physics dissolves this objection. If future boundary conditions constrain past states, consciousness needn't temporally precede neural activity to causally influence it. The selection of which outcome becomes actual can operate atemporally—determining which correlations hold across the entire temporal sequence, including the "preparatory" neural activity.

### The Quantum Zeno Interface

Henry Stapp's [quantum Zeno mechanism](/concepts/quantum-consciousness/) proposes that mental attention acts as rapid observation, holding neural patterns through the Zeno effect. Time-symmetric physics integrates naturally: each observation event participates in transactions; the pattern of observations determines which histories become actual; the "when" of each observation is less fundamental than the constraint-satisfaction structure across time.

### The Modified Growing Block

The Map's [temporal framework](/topics/time-collapse-and-agency/) proposes a modified growing block: past and present exist; the future doesn't yet. Collapse grows the block. Time-symmetric physics operates *within* the possibility structure that collapse resolves. The "future" participating in transactions is quantum possibility, not ontologically existing future fact. Once collapse occurs, the selected history is simply history—irreversible because definiteness replaces superposition.

This reconciles time-symmetry with real temporal becoming: symmetry holds at the level of possibility; asymmetry emerges through collapse into actuality.

## Objections and Responses

### "Retrocausality Violates Common Sense"

Common sense reflects our evolved perspective, not physical reality. Quantum mechanics already violates common sense (superposition, entanglement, wave-particle duality). The question is whether time-symmetry coheres with physics, not whether it matches intuition.

### "We Could Change the Past"

Retrocausality doesn't imply changing established facts. The transaction determines which facts become established. There's no "prior version" that gets overwritten. Backward causation contributes to constituting history, not altering it.

### "Where's the Evidence?"

Time-symmetric interpretations make the same predictions as standard interpretations for currently feasible experiments. This is why interpretation debates persist—empirical distinction remains elusive. But indistinguishability cuts both ways: time-symmetric interpretations cannot be empirically refuted either.

Wheeler's delayed-choice experiments provide indirect support. Measurement choices made *after* a particle passes through a double-slit determine whether it "behaved" as wave or particle *earlier*. A 2017 satellite experiment extended this over thousands of kilometres. The results are interpretable without retrocausality, but they're also precisely what retrocausal interpretations predict.

### "Decoherence Eliminates Quantum Effects"

[decoherence](/concepts/decoherence/) is often cited as ruling out quantum effects in warm biological systems—decoherence timescales at brain temperatures are femtoseconds, leaving no window for quantum coherence. But this objection misidentifies what time-symmetric theories require.

Time-symmetric interpretations don't need sustained coherence. The transactional interpretation, for instance, involves constraint-satisfaction between initial and final conditions—decoherence participates in this process by determining available bases, but the *transaction itself* is atemporal. The question is not whether the brain maintains coherent superpositions (it doesn't) but whether the selection of definite outcomes involves constraint-satisfaction across time.

Moreover, decoherence doesn't solve the [measurement-problem](/concepts/measurement-problem/)—it explains why we don't observe macroscopic superpositions while leaving unexplained why we observe *definite* outcomes. Something must still select which outcome becomes actual after decoherence has selected preferred bases. Decoherence operates within unitary evolution, which remains time-symmetric.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Time-symmetric physics connects to the Map's [tenets](/tenets/) in several ways:

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: If consciousness participates in atemporal selection—determining which transactions complete—it operates at a level physics alone doesn't describe. This positions consciousness as constitutive of physical outcomes, not reducible to them.

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)**: Time-symmetric selection is maximally minimal. Consciousness doesn't inject energy, override laws, or cause events at moments. It satisfies constraints physics leaves underdetermined. The interaction point is precisely where physics provides indeterminacy: measurement, collapse, transaction completion.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)**: Time-symmetric physics makes bidirectional causation natural rather than mysterious. If fundamental laws are symmetric, backward-pointing influence has the same physical status as forward-pointing. Consciousness affecting what becomes actual—including past neural preparation—follows from physics's own structure.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)**: Time-symmetric interpretations typically involve real collapse (transaction completion actualises one possibility). This contrasts with many-worlds, where no selection occurs—all outcomes exist in branching worlds. The Map's rejection of many-worlds aligns with interpretations that preserve genuine selection.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)**: Time-symmetry seems exotic from our forward-looking perspective. But the "simplicity" of forward-only causation may reflect cognitive limitation, not physical reality. Fundamental physics provides no privileged temporal direction; adding one requires justification that physics doesn't supply.
