Mysterianism is the view that the [hard problem of consciousness](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/) cannot be solved by human minds—not because consciousness is supernatural but because our cognitive architecture lacks the resources to grasp the solution. Colin McGinn formalized this position in 1989 through the concept of "cognitive closure": just as rats cannot do calculus and dogs cannot understand quantum mechanics, humans may be permanently unable to understand how consciousness relates to the brain. The solution might exist; we just can't reach it.

This position occupies important middle ground. Unlike eliminativism, mysterianism takes consciousness seriously as a real phenomenon requiring explanation. Unlike confident physicalism or dualism, it acknowledges the depth of the problem. The position strongly supports the [Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits) tenet: our sense of which explanations are "simple" may reflect our cognitive limitations rather than reality.

## Cognitive Closure

McGinn's key concept is cognitive closure. A type of mind M is cognitively closed with respect to a property P if M's concept-forming procedures cannot extend to a grasp of P. The property exists; M simply cannot conceive it.

This isn't about intelligence within a domain—it's about which domains are accessible at all. A very intelligent rat might do amazing things with mazes and social hierarchies. But no amount of rat intelligence grants access to differential equations. The conceptual apparatus isn't there.

McGinn proposes that humans are cognitively closed with respect to property "P"—whatever property of the brain explains how neural activity gives rise to conscious experience. We access consciousness through introspection and brain through perception, but neither mode of access reveals how they connect. The solution to the mind-body problem might be natural, even simple—but closed to beings like us.

## Nagel's Bat

Thomas Nagel anticipated mysterianism in his 1974 paper "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?" His central observation: understanding bat consciousness would require grasping what echolocation is *like* from the inside. But we cannot imagine this. We can imagine hanging upside down, eating insects, even navigating by sound—but these are *our* experiences wearing bat costumes. The subjective character of bat experience remains inaccessible.

Nagel's broader point: objective scientific methods cannot capture subjective experience without loss. To understand consciousness objectively, we would have to abstract away from viewpoints—but viewpoints are precisely what we're trying to understand. The gap isn't merely current ignorance. It's structural.

This leads to what Nagel calls a "conceptual revolution" that may be needed but which we cannot even conceive. We know the current conceptual framework fails. We don't know what would succeed.

## Problems Versus Mysteries

Noam Chomsky offered a related distinction between "problems" and "mysteries." Problems are difficulties that fall within our cognitive capacities—we can in principle solve them through systematic investigation. Mysteries lie beyond our cognitive reach, like number theory for cats or calculus for dogs.

Chomsky argued there's no reason to assume human cognitive capacities are unlimited. We're biological organisms with specific cognitive architectures shaped by evolution for specific purposes. Some questions may fall outside what that architecture can handle.

Consciousness might be such a mystery. The [explanatory-gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/) persists despite centuries of philosophical and scientific effort. Perhaps it persists not because we haven't tried hard enough but because trying harder won't help. The gap may be our cognitive closure made visible.

## Temporary Versus Permanent

A key distinction within mysterianism:

**Temporary mysterianism** holds that current science cannot explain consciousness, but future paradigm shifts might bridge the gap. New concepts, new methods, new frameworks—something will eventually click. The mystery is practical, not principled.

**Permanent mysterianism** holds that cognitive closure is permanent. No amount of scientific progress will solve the problem for beings like us. We might build artificial intelligences that solve it, or encounter alien minds that understand it—but *we* never will.

From our current perspective, both positions look identical. We can't know in advance which problems are permanently closed. But the distinction matters for how we interpret our situation. Temporary mysterians see the hard problem as a challenge; permanent mysterians see it as a limit.

## Mysterianism's Virtues

The position has several attractive features:

**Takes consciousness seriously**. Unlike [illusionism](/concepts/illusionism/) or eliminativism, mysterianism accepts that phenomenal experience is real and genuinely puzzling. Something needs explaining. The failure is ours, not the phenomenon's.

**Intellectually honest**. Rather than claiming to solve what remains unsolved, mysterianism acknowledges the depth of our ignorance. After centuries of failure, perhaps humility is appropriate.

**Explains the explanatory gap**. If we're cognitively closed to the property linking mind and brain, the [explanatory-gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/) is exactly what we'd expect. We can describe both sides without seeing the connection—because the connection lies outside our conceptual reach.

**Neutral on ontology**. Mysterianism doesn't require commitment to physicalism or dualism. The solution might be physicalist (some natural property P explains consciousness) or dualist (consciousness is irreducible) or something we can't conceive. All positions remain open.

## Criticisms

### The Defeatism Objection

Daniel Dennett and the Churchlands argue that mysterianism discourages investigation. Declaring a problem unsolvable encourages giving up prematurely. We cannot know in advance what problems are unsolvable, so we should keep trying.

The mysterian response: intellectual honesty isn't defeatism. We can continue investigating consciousness while acknowledging that success isn't guaranteed. And noting that centuries of effort have yielded little progress is observation, not surrender.

### The Vitalism Analogy

Critics note that "life" once seemed as mysterious as consciousness. Vitalists thought some *élan vital* explained living matter. But biology explained life through chemistry and physics—no mystery remained. Perhaps consciousness will follow.

The mysterian response: consciousness differs from life. Life's "mystery" was explaining coordinated behavior and reproduction—functional properties that turned out to be mechanistically explicable. Consciousness's mystery is explaining why there's subjective experience at all. That's not a functional property; it's the existence of an inner perspective. The analogy fails.

### The Squirrel Objection

If McGinn's argument works, why doesn't it apply everywhere? Why think consciousness is specially closed when we successfully understand many things?

The mysterian response: we succeed with properties that fall within our cognitive reach. Consciousness happens to fall outside it. This isn't surprising—some properties must fall outside any finite cognitive architecture. The question is which ones. The persistence of the hard problem suggests consciousness is among them.

## Relation to This Site's Perspective

Mysterianism aligns strongly with the [Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits) tenet. McGinn's position exemplifies exactly what the tenet asserts: our sense of which explanations are "simple" may reflect cognitive limitations rather than ontological facts. When physicalism seems simpler than dualism, that may mean only that we're closed to the complexity involved.

On [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism), mysterianism is officially neutral—but compatible. Mysterians accept that consciousness is real and requires explanation, aligning with the rejection of eliminativism. McGinn doesn't commit to dualism, but his acknowledgment that introspection and perception reveal different aspects of reality resonates with dualist intuitions.

This site goes further than mysterianism. Where mysterians remain agnostic about consciousness's nature, the site commits to irreducibility (Dualism) and causal efficacy ([Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)). Where mysterians suggest we cannot know how mind relates to matter, the site proposes [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) as a mechanism.

These commitments might be wrong—mysterianism warns that certainty exceeds our cognitive warrant. But the site's tenets are presented as commitments, not proofs. Mysterianism's humility is compatible with tentative positions. We can acknowledge our limits while still making our best guesses.

The site's [voids](/voids/) framework resonates with mysterian themes. McGinn's property "P" might be void territory—something that exists but lies beyond our conceptual reach. The difference: the voids framework suggests we can map the *edges* of void territory through apophatic methods, tracing what we cannot think. Mysterianism is more pessimistic, suggesting we can't even identify what we're missing.
