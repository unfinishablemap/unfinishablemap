Valence is the positive-negative dimension of conscious experience—the felt goodness of pleasure and the felt badness of pain. It is not a judgment, a representation, or a functional state, but an intrinsic phenomenal property: the badness of pain is a feature of the experience itself, not something the experience is *about*. The Unfinishable Map holds that valence is irreducible to physical description, that it does genuine causal work in motivating behavior, and that it grounds the moral significance of conscious beings.

## What Valence Is

Every conscious experience carries some degree of valence. Pain is negatively valenced; pleasure is positively valenced; emotions blend valence with other phenomenal qualities (fear's urgency differs from sadness's heaviness, though both feel bad). James Russell and Lisa Feldman Barrett's core affect theory holds that we are never affectively neutral—a background hedonic tone is always present, combining valence (pleasure-displeasure) with arousal (activation-deactivation).

Valence is not the same as the specific character of an experience. The painfulness of a burn and the painfulness of a betrayal share negative valence while differing in every other phenomenal respect. This generality is what makes valence fundamental: it provides a common evaluative dimension across all conscious experience, a "mental currency" (Cleeremans & Tallon-Baudry 2022) enabling comparison between otherwise incommensurable states.

## Two Competing Accounts

Two main philosophical accounts compete to explain what valence is.

**The hedonic account** treats valence as an intrinsic qualitative property of experience. The badness of pain is not *about* anything—it is a feature the pain has in virtue of being the experience it is. Just as redness is an intrinsic quality of visual experience, badness is an intrinsic quality of painful experience.

**The evaluativist account** (Carruthers 2018) treats valence as a nonconceptual representation of value. When afraid, attention is directed outward—the bear's claws seem dangerous. Valence represents goodness or badness in the world rather than being a property of the experience itself.

### Why the Hedonic Account Is Stronger

Pain asymbolia provides the decisive evidence. Patients with specific brain damage can represent tissue damage—they know their hand is burned—without feeling any badness. They have the representational content (evaluativist account) without the felt quality (hedonic property). If valence were merely a representation of value, these patients should still feel motivated to avoid damage. They don't.

The dissociation runs in only one direction. You can have representation without valence (asymbolia), but valence without representation is harder to identify—suggesting that valence is the more fundamental phenomenon. The hedonic account explains this asymmetry naturally: representation and valence are distinct properties that normally co-occur but can dissociate.

## Valence and the Hard Problem

Valence extends the [hard problem](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/) into its most vivid domain. A complete functional description of nociception—sensory transduction, neural signaling, defensive responses—leaves the badness unexplained. One could conceivably imagine a system that does everything pain does functionally (avoids damage, learns from injury, signals tissue harm) without feeling bad at all. The [zombie argument](/concepts/philosophical-zombies/) applies directly: a zombie's pain-processing would be functionally identical to ours yet lack the felt badness.

The explanatory gap for valence is particularly stark because the property seems so simple—just positive or negative—yet resists reduction completely. If we cannot explain why pain feels bad, the prospects for explaining the richer textures of grief, shame, or joy are dim.

## Valence Does Causal Work

[Epiphenomenalists](/concepts/epiphenomenalism/) might argue that felt badness merely accompanies the functional states that actually motivate behavior. Pain asymbolia challenges this. Patients with intact sensory pain processing but absent felt badness do not avoid painful stimuli with normal urgency. The phenomenal property—the felt badness—is what makes pain motivating. Remove it, and the behavioral output changes.

A [functionalist](/concepts/functionalism/) might object that asymbolia simply shows which functional subsystem is damaged—that the missing motivation *is* the missing function, redescribed in phenomenal language. But this response concedes the point in disguise: if "the function of felt badness" is exactly what's missing, the functionalist must explain what distinguishes this function from the intact nociceptive processing that remains. The most parsimonious answer is that the felt quality is a distinct property doing distinct causal work—precisely what the dualist claims.

This has direct implications for the [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet. If valenced phenomenal states motivate behavior, consciousness influences physical outcomes. The felt quality is not along for the ride—it is doing real work.

## Valence and Moral Status

If valence is an intrinsic phenomenal property, it provides the ground for moral significance. Jeremy Bentham's principle—"the question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?"—expresses *valence sentientism*: the capacity for negatively valenced experience is necessary for moral consideration.

This connects directly to [phenomenal-value-realism](/topics/phenomenal-value-realism/). If the badness of suffering is objective and intrinsic, moral facts may depend on phenomenal facts. The wrongness of causing suffering derives from suffering's intrinsic badness—a phenomenal property, not a functional state.

A gap remains between phenomenal and normative facts. That suffering *feels* bad does not immediately entail that causing it *ought not* be done. But valence provides the necessary condition: without felt badness, there is nothing for moral concern to be about.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Valence supports the Map's framework at multiple points.

The [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism) tenet finds strong support: if the felt badness of pain cannot be captured by functional or physical description—as the explanatory gap and pain asymbolia both demonstrate—then consciousness involves something beyond the material. Valence is an intrinsic phenomenal property that resists every reductive strategy.

The [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet gains empirical backing from asymbolia cases. When the phenomenal property is absent, behavior changes. The felt quality is causally efficacious, not epiphenomenal.

The [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) tenet connects speculatively: if consciousness biases neural outcomes, valence may provide the criterion for selection. Consciousness doesn't randomly influence quantum indeterminacies—it does so guided by valenced assessment, choosing among neural possibilities based on anticipated pleasure or pain.
