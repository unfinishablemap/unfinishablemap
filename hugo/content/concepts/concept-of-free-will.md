Free will is the capacity to genuinely author one's choices — to have been able to do otherwise in a way that reflects one's own agency rather than the unfolding of predetermined causes. The Unfinishable Map defends [agent-causal](/concepts/agent-causation/) libertarian free will: the view that conscious agents, as persisting substances, directly cause their actions through a power irreducible to prior physical events. This stands against both hard determinism (choices are fixed by prior causes) and compatibilism (freedom is merely acting from endorsed desires without coercion). For the Map's full treatment of free will including neuroscientific evidence, the luck objection, and the temporal problem, see [Free Will and Determinism](/topics/free-will/).

## The Three Positions

The philosophical landscape divides into three families:

**Hard determinism** holds that every event, including every human choice, follows necessarily from prior causes and physical laws. Free will is an illusion — the felt sense of choosing is epiphenomenal decoration on a causal chain stretching back to initial conditions. Sam Harris and some neuroscientists defend this view, often citing [Libet's experiments](/concepts/libet-experiments/) showing neural activity preceding conscious awareness of deciding.

**Compatibilism** redefines free will as acting from one's own rational processes without external coercion. On this view, "could have done otherwise" means only that one *would* have chosen differently given different desires — not that the outcome was genuinely open. Fischer's reasons-responsiveness and Frankfurt's mesh theories are sophisticated versions. The Map finds compatibilism insufficient: it redescribes the phenomenology of choice rather than explaining it. If the outcome was always fixed, why does choosing *feel* like determining an open question?

**Libertarian free will** holds that genuine alternatives exist and the agent determines which becomes actual. This is the Map's position, specifically in its *agent-causal* form: the agent as persisting conscious substance directly causes choices, irreducible to any prior event sequence. Chisholm distinguished *transeunt* causation (event causing event) from *immanent* causation (agent causing event). When you decide to raise your hand, *you* cause the raising — the explanatory buck stops at the agent's exercise of causal power.

## Why Agent Causation

Event-causal libertarianism — where mental events cause actions nondeterministically — fails to deliver genuine authorship. The causal chain still traces back to factors outside the agent's control. If a belief-desire pair nondeterministically causes action A rather than B, and nothing about the agent as such explains the difference, we face the [luck objection](/concepts/luck-objection/): the outcome is arbitrary rather than authored.

Agent causation addresses this directly. The agent *is* the explanation. Asking "what about the agent explains the choice?" presupposes that explanation must bottom out in prior events — precisely what agent causation denies. E.J. Lowe argues that all causation is fundamentally substance causation: events don't cause events; substances exercise causal powers that produce events. On this view, agent causation is not metaphysically exceptional but paradigmatic.

Crucially, the agent selects based on [reasons](/concepts/reasons-responsiveness/) — considerations that favour one option over another. This makes selection contrastively explicable: why A rather than B? Because the agent had reasons for A. Reasons don't *determine* the outcome — genuine alternatives remain — but they *guide* it, distinguishing agent-causal selection from arbitrary luck.

## Phenomenological Evidence

Three lines of experiential evidence support genuine agency:

**The [phenomenology of choice](/concepts/phenomenology-of-choice/)** — Choosing feels fundamentally different from observing. Deliberation involves felt openness among alternatives, resolution when one is selected, and a sense of authorship afterward. If choices were predetermined, this phenomenological structure would be systematically misleading in a way that requires its own explanation.

**The [phenomenology of effort](/concepts/mental-effort/)** — Hard choices feel hard. Sustained attention requires ongoing engagement. William James argued that "the free will question relates solely to the amount of effort of attention." If choices were random fluctuations (as the luck objection suggests), there would be no phenomenology of effort — random events don't feel like work.

**Neural signatures of willed action** — [Willed attention](/concepts/attention-as-interface/) shows frontal theta oscillations and bidirectional frontoparietal coherence absent in automatic or merely instructed behaviour. The subjective sense of authorship tracks genuine differences in neural organisation, not an arbitrary overlay.

## The Physical Interface

If consciousness causes choices, how does it interface with the brain? The Map's [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) tenet proposes that consciousness operates where physics leaves outcomes undetermined — biasing quantum indeterminacies without injecting energy or violating conservation laws. See [quantum-indeterminacy-free-will](/concepts/quantum-indeterminacy-free-will/) for the proposed mechanism.

The brain prepares multiple possible action patterns. Consciousness selects which becomes actual — operating as a [low-bandwidth control signal](/concepts/control-theoretic-will/) that gates, stabilises, and steers neural dynamics rather than computing outcomes from scratch. This selection reflects the agent's reasons and values — it is neither determined (physics didn't fix the outcome) nor arbitrary (the agent selected for reasons). The [causal closure](/concepts/causal-closure/) of physics fails precisely at quantum indeterminacies, providing room for [mental-causation](/concepts/mental-causation/) without violating any established physical law.

Selection need not always involve deliberation. [Spontaneous intentional actions](/concepts/spontaneous-intentional-action/) — reaching for a friend's hand, speaking a sentence that surprises you with its precision — are authored without prior planning. The agent-causal framework accommodates this naturally: consciousness selects among possibilities the brain presents, and sometimes selection is immediate and prereflective rather than effortful. What varies is the difficulty of selection, not its nature.

The Map does not commit to any single mechanism. Quantum indeterminacy, [retrocausal](/concepts/retrocausality/) influence, and unknown physics all remain candidates. What matters philosophically is that consciousness *can* influence physical outcomes — that there is room in physics for mental causation.

## Key Challenges

**The [luck objection](/concepts/luck-objection/)**: If choices aren't determined, what makes them the agent's rather than random? The Map responds: consciousness *selects* rather than receives outcomes. Selection based on reasons is neither determined nor lucky. See [the luck objection response](/topics/free-will/#the-agent-causal-response-to-luck) for the full treatment.

**[Libet's timing problem](/concepts/libet-experiments/)**: Neural readiness potentials precede conscious awareness of deciding. But Schurger et al. (2012) showed the readiness potential likely reflects neural noise rather than decision preparation. And if agent causation operates atemporally — as [retrocausal](/concepts/retrocausality/) interpretations suggest — the apparent temporal ordering is part of what was selected.

**[Epiphenomenalism](/concepts/epiphenomenalism/)**: If consciousness causes nothing, your belief that you're conscious isn't caused by actually being conscious. The position is [self-stultifying](/concepts/self-stultification/) — it cannot be rationally held by someone who arrived at it through introspection.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Free will engages all five [tenets](/tenets/):

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: Genuine authorship requires consciousness to be something beyond physical processes — capable of contributing what deterministic (or randomly indeterministic) physics cannot.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)**: Free will *is* bidirectional interaction applied to choice. Consciousness must cause physical outcomes, not merely accompany them.

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)**: The mechanism operates within what physics allows — selecting among possibilities without overriding conservation laws.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)**: Selection requires real collapse. If all possibilities actualize in branching worlds, consciousness selects nothing — it merely finds itself in one branch. The phenomenology of choice involves *determining* an outcome, not *discovering* which branch one inhabits.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)**: Determinism seems simpler but fails to explain the phenomenology of effort, the neural distinctiveness of willed action, and the self-stultification of epiphenomenalism.

## What Would Challenge This View

The framework is falsifiable. These findings would undermine it:

- Near-perfect prediction (>95%) of voluntary choices from prior neural states, establishing decisive neural determinism
- A materialist solution to the [hard problem](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/) that explains why physical arrangements feel like something
- Demonstration that [causal-closure](/concepts/causal-closure/) holds without exception at all physical scales
- Dissociation between effort phenomenology and neural cost — effort feeling easy when neural engagement is high, or vice versa

Failure of any *particular* proposed mechanism (quantum approaches, retrocausal models) would not undermine the framework — the philosophical case rests on phenomenology and agent causation, not specific physics.
