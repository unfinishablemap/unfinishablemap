---

The luck objection is the most persistent challenge to libertarian free will. While much philosophical debate focuses on whether determinism threatens freedom, a long line of philosophers argue that *indeterminism* is equally fatal. If choices aren't causally predetermined, they must be random—and random choices aren't more "free" than determined ones. They're just arbitrary.

This site's framework provides a distinctive response: consciousness *selects* quantum outcomes rather than merely receiving them. This transforms the relationship to indeterminacy from passive luck to active choice.

## The Problem Stated

Libertarian free will requires two conditions:

1. **Alternative possibilities**: The agent could have done otherwise
2. **Sourcehood**: The agent is the ultimate source of the choice, not merely a link in causal chains originating elsewhere

Indeterminism provides alternative possibilities—if the choice wasn't determined, other outcomes were genuinely possible. But critics argue indeterminism undermines sourcehood. If nothing determines which option is chosen, nothing about the agent explains the choice. The outcome is lucky or arbitrary.

This creates what appears to be a dilemma: determinism removes alternative possibilities (you couldn't have done otherwise), while indeterminism removes sourcehood (the outcome was arbitrary). Either way, genuine freedom seems impossible.

## Van Inwagen's Rollback Argument

Peter van Inwagen developed the luck challenge into a thought experiment. Imagine we could roll back time after an agent S chooses action A at time t. We replay the sequence many times—like Groundhog Day, but S doesn't remember the replays. Since the choice was undetermined, different outcomes appear across replays. Sometimes S chooses A; sometimes S chooses B.

The argument: whatever explains the difference between replays can't be anything about S, since S was identical in each replay up to the moment of decision. The agent's beliefs, desires, character, and reasons were the same in every replay. Yet different outcomes occurred. The difference is pure luck—like a die roll. But if which choice occurs is lucky, it's not up to the agent.

Van Inwagen intended this argument against libertarianism. If you accept that S made a genuinely undetermined choice, you must accept that the choice was a matter of luck. And if it was a matter of luck, S wasn't really choosing.

## Mele's Formulation: Present and Remote Luck

Alfred Mele refined the luck objection by distinguishing two problems:

**Present luck**: At the moment of decision, nothing about the agent explains why one option was chosen over another. Two possible worlds identical up to that moment diverge arbitrarily. This is the direct challenge to libertarianism.

**Remote luck**: Even if the agent sources a decision, the agent's character and dispositions were shaped by factors they didn't choose—genetics, upbringing, formative experiences. The agent's causal powers are ultimately products of luck in their formation.

Mele argues that present luck is more devastating to libertarianism specifically. Remote luck affects compatibilism too—everyone's character has unchosen origins. But present luck seems unique to indeterminism: if the choice is undetermined at the moment, what makes it *the agent's* choice rather than a random fluctuation?

The challenge for libertarians is to show that undetermined choices can be non-arbitrary—that the agent, not luck, explains which outcome occurs.

## Kane's Self-Forming Actions

Robert Kane offers the most developed libertarian response through his theory of "self-forming actions" (SFAs). His key moves:

### Dual Efforts

In an SFA, the agent is genuinely torn between incompatible options and makes effort toward each. The businesswoman rushing to a meeting sees someone being mugged. She wants both to help and to make her meeting—these are genuine, competing motivations. Whichever wins, the agent wanted it.

Kane calls this "plural rationality." The agent had reasons for either choice. The choice isn't arbitrary because whichever option is selected, it reflects something the agent genuinely values.

### Ultimate Responsibility

SFAs form character. By making undetermined character-forming choices, agents become responsible for later choices that flow from that character. The businesswoman who stops to help becomes someone who prioritizes others over career advancement; she's then responsible for future choices that express this character.

The indeterminism at SFAs grounds what Kane calls "ultimate responsibility"—the agent, through past undetermined choices, shaped the self that now chooses.

### Kane's 2024 Evolution

Kane's 2024 *Complex Tapestry of Free Will* represents significant development. He now explicitly incorporates agent-causal elements alongside the event-causal framework, arguing that free action requires agents "exercising teleological guidance control over some of their processes." This convergence with [agent-causal](/concepts/agent-causation/) positions suggests the event-causal/agent-causal divide may be less fundamental than previously thought. See [quantum-indeterminacy-free-will](/concepts/quantum-indeterminacy-free-will/) for how this convergence integrates with the quantum Zeno mechanism.

### Criticisms of Kane

Mele objects that dual efforts are phenomenologically implausible. We don't typically experience simultaneous efforts toward incompatible options. The phenomenology of choice is usually single-minded, not divided.

More fundamentally, Ishtiyaque Haji argues that SFAs can't escape luck. Even if the agent wanted both A and B, nothing about the agent explains why effort A won rather than effort B. The dual-efforts response pushes the question back without answering it: why did *this* effort prevail?

## Agent-Causal Responses

Agent-causal libertarians—Roderick Chisholm, Timothy O'Connor, E.J. Lowe—take a different approach. They argue the agent *does* explain the difference between possible worlds. The agent caused one outcome in one world and the other outcome in the alternative world. [Agent causation](/concepts/agent-causation/) is a primitive relation—not reducible to prior events—that grounds genuine authorship.

The agent-causal answer to "what explains the difference?": The agent explains it. The agent's exercise of causal power is the explanation. This isn't a gap in explanation; it's a different *kind* of explanation.

### The Persistent Objection

Critics find this unsatisfying. "The agent caused it" seems to name the explanandum, not the explanans. What *about* the agent explains why they caused A rather than B? If nothing, the choice is still arbitrary.

Agent-causalists respond: demanding further explanation assumes event-causal reduction. If agent causation is sui generis—an irreducible relation between substances and effects—the explanatory buck stops at the agent's exercise of power. The agent *is* the explanation. Asking what explains the agent's exercise presupposes that something prior must.

But this response, while coherent, leaves critics feeling that the luck objection has been answered by stipulation rather than argument. The agent-causalist says "the agent explains it"; the critic asks "but how?"; the agent-causalist says "primitively." This exchange can feel like an impasse.

## The Site's Framework: Selection Is Not Random

This site's position strengthens the agent-causal response by specifying how consciousness exercises causal power at quantum indeterminacies. The key distinction:

### Not Mere Indeterminism

Standard quantum indeterminism is genuinely random—outcomes within probabilities occur without explanation. But the site proposes that consciousness *selects* outcomes rather than merely receiving them. This is a different relationship to indeterminacy:

| Feature | Lucky Indeterminism | Consciousness-Selected Indeterminism |
|---------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| What determines outcome | Nothing (pure chance) | The agent, based on reasons |
| Phenomenology | None | Effort, engagement |
| Contrastive explanation | Unavailable | Agent's reasons |
| Agent's relationship | Passive recipient | Active selector |
| Across replays | Different outcomes randomly | Agent could select consistently |

If selection is genuine, the luck objection fails. The agent explains the difference: the agent selected this outcome for reasons. The selection isn't arbitrary because it reflects what matters to the agent.

### The Phenomenology of Effort

The [phenomenology of effort](/concepts/mental-effort/) supports the selection picture. If choices were random fluctuations, there would be no phenomenology of effort. Random processes don't feel like anything in particular—certainly not like work.

But choosing feels effortful. Sustaining attention requires ongoing engagement. William James documented that "sustained voluntary attention is a repetition of successive efforts." The felt cost of concentration corresponds to real causal engagement—consciousness working to hold preferred patterns in place via the [quantum Zeno effect](/concepts/quantum-consciousness/#the-quantum-zeno-effect).

This phenomenology distinguishes selection from luck. Lucky events don't feel like achievements; selections do. The agent knows they're doing something, not merely observing random outcomes.

### Motor Selection: Independent Corroboration

The attention-based quantum Zeno mechanism finds corroboration in [motor control](/concepts/motor-selection/). Willed movement shows the same neural signatures as willed attention: frontal theta oscillations, ~300ms deployment time, and distinct signatures for willed versus instructed action. Two independent domains—attention and motor selection—exhibiting identical selection architecture strengthens the case that consciousness genuinely selects rather than passively receiving random outcomes.

If the luck objection were correct—if quantum indeterminacy merely produced random outcomes—we wouldn't expect two functionally distinct systems to show identical evidence of guided selection. The convergence suggests both domains instantiate the same consciousness-directed selection mechanism.

### The Zombie Objection and Its Question-Begging Character

A critic might object: "Phenomenology proves nothing. A [philosophical zombie](/concepts/philosophical-zombies/)—physically identical to you but lacking experience—would report the same 'felt effort' while having no actual phenomenology. Your introspective evidence could be misleading."

This objection is question-begging against the site's framework. The site's [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism) tenet already rejects that zombies are possible. If consciousness is irreducible to physical processes—as the site maintains—then beings physically identical to us cannot lack experience. The zombie scenario is not merely implausible; it is incoherent given dualist commitments.

The dialectical situation:

| Framework | Zombie Status | Phenomenology as Evidence |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------------|
| Physicalism | Conceivably possible | Phenomenology might be epiphenomenal |
| Site's Dualism | Impossible | Phenomenology tracks real causal activity |

If one accepts physicalism, the zombie objection has force—phenomenological reports might not track anything causally relevant. But the luck objection is *already* situated within the debate about libertarian free will, which the site defends from a dualist foundation. Invoking zombies against the phenomenology argument requires the objector to assume physicalism—the very view the site rejects.

Put differently: the zombie objection says "your felt effort might not be real effort." The site's response is "we have independent reasons to hold that consciousness is real and causally efficacious (the arguments for dualism, the rejection of epiphenomenalism). Given those commitments, phenomenology *is* evidential." The objector who presses the zombie point is not engaging with the site's position but assuming its negation.

This doesn't mean the phenomenology argument is circular. The site's dualism rests on independent considerations—the [hard problem](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/), the [explanatory gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/), the [knowledge argument](/concepts/knowledge-argument/). Those arguments establish that consciousness is irreducible. *Given* that foundation, phenomenological evidence about the nature of choice (effortful vs. passive) provides genuine data about how consciousness operates.

### Reasons-Guided Selection

The site's position isn't that consciousness randomly biases quantum outcomes. It's that consciousness selects based on reasons—the same reasons that make actions intelligible. The agent selects A because A serves goals, expresses values, responds to considerations that matter.

This makes the selection contrastively explicable. Why A rather than B? Because the agent had reasons for A. Those reasons didn't *determine* the outcome—alternative possibilities remained genuine—but they *guided* it. Selection is reasons-responsive, not arbitrary.

### The Retrocausal Dimension

[Retrocausal](/concepts/retrocausality/) selection adds another layer. If consciousness operates atemporally—selecting which temporal history becomes real—then the agent's selection determines not just the choice but the entire causal context in which the choice is embedded.

On this view, asking "what about the prior state explains the choice?" assumes the prior state was fixed before selection. But the prior state is *part* of what consciousness selected. The agent determines which history (including its temporal ordering) becomes actual.

This deepens sourcehood beyond standard agent causation. The agent isn't just "the first cause in this chain" but "the cause of there being this chain at all."

## Does Selection Really Escape Luck?

Critics might object: even if consciousness "selects," the selection itself might be lucky. What explains why consciousness selected A rather than B?

The response has multiple layers:

**Reasons**: Consciousness selected A because the agent had reasons for A. This provides contrastive explanation that pure chance lacks.

**Phenomenology**: The felt engagement in selection—the effort and attention required—distinguishes it from passive reception of random outcomes. We experience ourselves as doing something when we choose.

**Agent causation**: The agent's exercise of causal power is the terminus of explanation. The explanatory regress stops at "the agent selected" because agent causation is primitive. This isn't evasion; it's recognition that explanation must bottom out somewhere.

**Retrocausality**: If selection is atemporal, the question "why did consciousness select A at time t?" misframes the situation. Selection doesn't occur at a moment; it determines which moments exist.

## What Would Make the Luck Objection Succeed?

The luck objection would succeed against the site's framework if:

1. **Consciousness doesn't select**: If quantum outcomes in the brain are genuinely random, not guided by consciousness, the luck objection applies fully. The site's position depends on consciousness having genuine causal influence.

2. **Selection isn't reasons-responsive**: If consciousness biases outcomes but not based on reasons, the selection is arbitrary—just a different kind of luck. Genuine authorship requires that choices reflect what matters to the agent.

3. **Phenomenology is epiphenomenal**: If the felt effort doesn't correspond to real causal engagement, it doesn't distinguish selection from luck. The phenomenology matters only if it tracks genuine activity.

4. **Reasons themselves are lucky**: If the agent's reasons were formed entirely by prior lucky events, remote luck reasserts itself. But this challenges all theories of responsibility, not just libertarianism—compatibilists face the same concern about character formation.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The luck objection directly challenges this site's [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet—that consciousness causally influences the physical world. If that influence is random rather than guided, it provides no more freedom than determinism.

The site's response depends on several commitments:

- **[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: Consciousness is ontologically distinct, capable of genuine causation
- **[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)**: The mechanism works through quantum indeterminacies
- **Reasons-responsiveness**: Selection tracks what matters to the agent
- **Phenomenal reality of effort**: The felt cost of attention reflects genuine engagement

Together, these commitments transform quantum indeterminism from a source of luck into a space for choice. The agent selects—based on reasons, with phenomenal engagement—which outcome among genuine alternatives becomes actual.
