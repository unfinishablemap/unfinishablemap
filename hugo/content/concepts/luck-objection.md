title: The Luck Objection to Libertarian Free Will
topics:
- '[[topics/free-will]]'
---

The luck objection is the most persistent challenge to libertarian [free will](/concepts/concept-of-free-will/). While much philosophical debate focuses on whether determinism threatens freedom, a long line of philosophers argue that *indeterminism* is equally fatal. If choices aren't causally predetermined, they must be random—and random choices aren't more "free" than determined ones. They're just arbitrary.

The Unfinishable Map's framework provides a distinctive response: consciousness *selects* quantum outcomes rather than merely receiving them. This transforms the relationship to indeterminacy from passive luck to active choice.

## The Problem Stated

Libertarian free will requires two conditions:

1. **Alternative possibilities**: The agent could have done otherwise
2. **Sourcehood**: The agent is the ultimate source of the choice, not merely a link in causal chains originating elsewhere

Indeterminism provides alternative possibilities—if the choice wasn't determined, other outcomes were genuinely possible. But critics argue indeterminism undermines sourcehood. If nothing determines which option is chosen, nothing about the agent explains the choice. The outcome is lucky or arbitrary.

This creates what appears to be a dilemma: determinism removes alternative possibilities (you couldn't have done otherwise), while indeterminism removes sourcehood (the outcome was arbitrary). Either way, genuine freedom seems impossible.

## Van Inwagen's Rollback Argument

Peter van Inwagen's thought experiment: roll back time after an agent S chooses action A. Replay the sequence many times. Since the choice was undetermined, different outcomes appear—sometimes S chooses A, sometimes B. Whatever explains the difference can't be anything about S, since S was identical in each replay up to the decision moment. The difference is pure luck. But if which choice occurs is lucky, it's not up to the agent.

## Mele's Formulation: Present and Remote Luck

Alfred Mele distinguishes **present luck** (nothing about the agent explains why one option was chosen at the moment of decision) from **remote luck** (the agent's character was shaped by unchosen factors). Present luck is more devastating to libertarianism—remote luck affects all theories equally, but present luck seems unique to indeterminism. The challenge: show that undetermined choices can be non-arbitrary.

## Kane's Self-Forming Actions

Robert Kane argues that in "self-forming actions" (SFAs), the agent is genuinely torn between incompatible options and makes effort toward each—what he calls "plural rationality." The choice isn't arbitrary because whichever option wins, it reflects something the agent genuinely values. SFAs form character: by making undetermined character-forming choices, agents become ultimately responsible for later choices that flow from that character.

Kane's 2024 *Complex Tapestry of Free Will* now explicitly incorporates [agent-causal](/concepts/agent-causation/) elements, arguing that free action requires agents "exercising teleological guidance control." This convergence suggests the event-causal/agent-causal divide may be less fundamental than thought. See [quantum-indeterminacy-free-will](/concepts/quantum-indeterminacy-free-will/) for integration with the quantum Zeno mechanism.

**Criticism**: Even if the agent wanted both A and B, nothing about the agent explains why effort A won rather than B. The dual-efforts response pushes the question back without answering it.

## Agent-Causal Responses

[Agent-causal](/concepts/agent-causation/) libertarians (Chisholm, O'Connor, Lowe) argue the agent *does* explain the difference between possible worlds. Agent causation is a primitive relation—not reducible to prior events—that grounds genuine authorship. The agent's exercise of causal power *is* the explanation.

Critics find this unsatisfying: "the agent caused it" seems to name the explanandum, not the explanans. Agent-causalists respond that demanding further explanation assumes event-causal reduction. If agent causation is sui generis, the explanatory buck stops at the agent. This exchange can feel like an impasse—which the Map's framework aims to resolve.

## The Map's Framework: Selection Is Not Random

The Map strengthens the agent-causal response by specifying *how* consciousness exercises causal power. Standard quantum indeterminism is genuinely random. But the Map proposes that consciousness *selects* outcomes rather than merely receiving them:

| Feature | Lucky Indeterminism | Consciousness-Selected |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------|
| What determines outcome | Nothing (chance) | Agent's reasons |
| Phenomenology | None | Effort, engagement |
| Agent's relationship | Passive recipient | Active selector |

If selection is genuine, the luck objection fails. The agent explains the difference by selecting for reasons.

### The Phenomenology of Effort

The [phenomenology of effort](/concepts/mental-effort/) supports selection. If choices were random fluctuations, there would be no phenomenology of effort—random processes don't feel like work. But choosing feels effortful. The felt cost of concentration corresponds to real causal engagement via the [quantum Zeno effect](/concepts/quantum-consciousness/#the-quantum-zeno-effect). Lucky events don't feel like achievements; selections do.

### Motor Selection: Corroboration

[Motor control](/concepts/motor-selection/) shows the same neural signatures as willed attention: frontal theta oscillations, ~300ms deployment time, distinct signatures for willed versus instructed action. Two independent domains exhibiting identical selection architecture strengthens the case that consciousness genuinely selects.

### The Zombie Objection

A critic might object that a [philosophical zombie](/concepts/philosophical-zombies/) would report the same "felt effort" without actual phenomenology. But this is question-begging against the Map's framework. The [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism) tenet rejects that zombies are possible—if consciousness is irreducible to physical processes, beings physically identical to us cannot lack experience. The zombie objection requires assuming physicalism, the very view the Map rejects. Given dualist commitments grounded in the [hard problem](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/) and [knowledge argument](/concepts/knowledge-argument/), phenomenology *is* evidential.

### Reasons-Guided Selection

Consciousness selects based on reasons—the same reasons that make actions intelligible. Why A rather than B? Because the agent had reasons for A. Those reasons didn't *determine* the outcome—alternative possibilities remained genuine—but they *guided* it.

### The Retrocausal Dimension

[Retrocausal](/concepts/retrocausality/) selection deepens sourcehood. If consciousness operates atemporally, asking "what about the prior state explains the choice?" assumes the prior state was fixed before selection. But the prior state is *part* of what consciousness selected. The agent isn't just "the first cause in this chain" but "the cause of there being this chain at all."

## Does Selection Really Escape Luck?

Critics might object: what explains why consciousness selected A rather than B? The response: **Reasons** provide contrastive explanation that pure chance lacks. **Phenomenology** distinguishes selection from passive reception—we experience ourselves doing something. **Agent causation** is the terminus of explanation; the regress stops at the agent's exercise of power. **Retrocausality** means selection doesn't occur at a moment but determines which moments exist.

## What Would Make the Luck Objection Succeed?

The luck objection would succeed if: (1) consciousness doesn't actually select quantum outcomes, (2) selection isn't reasons-responsive, or (3) phenomenology is epiphenomenal and doesn't track real causal engagement. Remote luck (reasons formed by prior lucky events) challenges all responsibility theories equally.

## The Illusionist Challenge

[Illusionists](/concepts/illusionism/) argue that "phenomenology of effort" is a functional representation, not evidence of non-physical causation. But the illusionist account faces a regress: saying the feeling of effort is a "representation" presupposes something experiencing it. That something cannot be another representation without infinite regress—misrepresentation presupposes presentation.

The [introspection literature](/concepts/introspection/) identifies where reports fail (causal processes, decision justification) but also where they succeed (basic phenomenal states, effort). The convergence of phenomenological report with neural signature suggests introspection tracks something real.

## The Decoherence Challenge

Warm neural tissue [decoheres](/concepts/decoherence/) quantum superpositions in femtoseconds, far too fast for the 300ms attention deployment to exploit. Three mitigations: (1) Decoherence doesn't solve the measurement problem—something must still select which outcome becomes actual. (2) The Zeno mechanism requires rapid observation events, not sustained coherence between them. (3) Quantum biology has revealed coherence effects in warm systems that Tegmark's calculations ruled out—photosynthesis, avian magnetoreception, and the 2024 epothilone B study showing microtubule-stabilizers extend time to anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. The categorical objection has been significantly weakened, though neural applications remain open.

## Contemplative Evidence

The contrast between [witnessing](/concepts/witness-consciousness/) (effortless observation) and selecting (effortful concentration) supports genuine causal options. If consciousness were always inert, there would be no phenomenological difference. But contemplatives report a clear distinction: witnessing involves no effort because no selection occurs; concentration involves effort because selection is ongoing.

Buddhism's *anattā* might seem to undermine agent causation, but [Buddhism doesn't deny consciousness exists](/concepts/buddhism-and-dualism/)—it denies permanent ownership. Selection can occur moment-to-moment without requiring an eternal selector. Process [haecceity](/concepts/haecceity/)—being *this* selecting awareness at each moment—suffices for genuine authorship.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The luck objection directly challenges the Map's [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet. If consciousness's influence is random rather than guided, it provides no more freedom than determinism.

**Dualism**: The [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism) tenet grounds the response. If consciousness is nothing but physical processes, "consciousness selects" collapses into "physics determines"—no selector distinct from what's being selected. The irreducibility of consciousness makes selection possible.

**Minimal Quantum Interaction**: The [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) tenet specifies *how* selection works—biasing which among physically possible outcomes actualizes, without overriding physics or injecting energy. The decoherence challenge targets this tenet, but quantum biology has shown the categorical objection is too strong.

**No Many Worlds**: The [No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds) tenet is essential. If all branches are equally real (MWI), no selection occurs—every outcome actualizes somewhere. The Map's response requires rejecting MWI: collapse is real, consciousness participates in it, and genuine choice results.

**Occam's Razor Has Limits**: The [Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits) tenet addresses whether the selection framework is too complicated. Simplicity is unreliable when genuinely ignorant about consciousness, quantum mechanics, and their interaction. The phenomenology and neural signatures suggest a real phenomenon resisting deflationary treatment.
