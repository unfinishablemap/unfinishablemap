title: Conceivability-Possibility Inference
topics: []
---

The conceivability-possibility inference is the principle that if something can be coherently conceived, it is at least metaphysically possible. This seemingly innocent bridge from imagination to reality powers some of philosophy's most contested arguments—particularly in philosophy of mind, where [zombie arguments](/concepts/philosophical-zombies/) and the [knowledge argument](/concepts/knowledge-argument/) depend on inferring genuine metaphysical possibilities from acts of conceiving.

The inference matters because conceivability is epistemically accessible—we can investigate what we can and cannot imagine—while metaphysical possibility concerns the structure of reality itself, which may be hidden from direct inspection. If conceivability reliably tracks possibility, we gain an investigative tool. If it doesn't, major arguments collapse.

## The Basic Inference

**Standard form:**
1. S can coherently conceive that P
2. If P is coherently conceivable, then P is metaphysically possible
3. Therefore, P is metaphysically possible

**Example application (zombie argument):**
1. I can coherently conceive of a being physically identical to me but lacking consciousness
2. If such a being is coherently conceivable, it is metaphysically possible
3. Therefore, [philosophical-zombies](/concepts/philosophical-zombies/) are metaphysically possible
4. If zombies are possible, [physicalism](/arguments/materialism/) is false (consciousness is not entailed by physical facts)

The inference transforms a first-person imaginative act into a claim about the fundamental structure of reality.

## Chalmers' Refinement

David Chalmers has developed the most sophisticated defense of conceivability-possibility reasoning. His framework distinguishes types of conceivability and types of possibility, then specifies which pairings yield reliable inferences.

### Types of Conceivability

**Prima facie vs. ideal conceivability:**
- **Prima facie**: Seems conceivable on initial reflection, but might contain hidden contradictions
- **Ideal**: Survives idealized rational reflection—no contradiction emerges even under maximal scrutiny

**Positive vs. negative conceivability:**
- **Positive**: Can form a detailed imagined situation where P holds
- **Negative**: Cannot detect any contradiction in P even after careful analysis

Prima facie conceivability is unreliable—many mathematical falsehoods seem conceivable until proven impossible. Chalmers argues that *ideal positive conceivability* provides the strongest epistemic warrant for possibility claims.

### The Core Claim

Chalmers defends: **Ideal positive conceivability entails primary possibility**.

"Primary possibility" concerns whether a scenario is ruled out by the fundamental nature of properties themselves, not merely by how those properties happen to be instantiated in our world. Water being H₂O is not primarily necessary—we can conceive of "water" (the clear liquid that falls as rain) being a different chemical compound. But water being conscious might be primarily impossible if consciousness has an essential nature incompatible with purely physical structure.

The zombie argument exploits this: if we can ideally positively conceive of physical duplicates lacking consciousness, then consciousness is not necessitated by physical structure itself—it's a further fact about reality.

## Challenges to the Inference

### The Confabulation Objection

**Problem:** What feels like genuine conceiving might be pseudo-conceiving—manipulating labels without grasping genuine content.

When you "conceive" of a zombie, are you imagining a genuinely complete physical duplicate that lacks consciousness? Or are you just *telling yourself* you're imagining this while actually leaving crucial details unspecified?

The research on [conceptual impossibility](/research/voids-conceptual-impossibility-2026-01-23/) reveals an asymmetry: we can *refer to* impossibilities like "round square" without being able to *grasp* them. Could zombie conceivability be similar—linguistic reference without genuine conceptual content?

**Response:** Chalmers acknowledges this risk, which is why he requires *ideal positive* conceivability. Ideal reflection involves filling in details, checking for hidden contradictions, and ensuring the imagined scenario is coherent under sustained scrutiny. If gaps remain under ideal reflection, conceivability fails.

### The Two-Dimensional Objection

**Problem:** Conceivability might track epistemic possibility (compatible with what we know) rather than metaphysical possibility (compatible with reality's structure).

Before Kripke, philosophers thought "water is not H₂O" was conceivable. It seemed imaginable that water could be a different substance. But Kripke argued this was an illusion—what we conceived was a *watery stuff* that isn't H₂O, not *water itself* being non-H₂O. Water is necessarily H₂O; we just didn't know this initially.

Could zombie conceivability be similar? We *think* we're conceiving of physical duplicates lacking consciousness, but actually we're conceiving of *something else* (non-conscious functional duplicates that aren't genuine physical duplicates).

**Response:** Chalmers' two-dimensional semantics is designed to address this. He distinguishes primary intensions (how terms pick out referents given incomplete information) from secondary intensions (how terms pick out referents given the actual world). Zombie conceivability operates at the primary level—and if consciousness is not part of the primary intension of "physical," then physicalism fails.

### The Strength-Mismatch Objection

**Problem:** Even if conceivability provides *some* evidence for possibility, it might not be strong enough to bear the argumentative weight placed on it.

Philosophers have conceived many scenarios later proven impossible: Euclidean geometry in all scales (contradicted by relativity), deterministic physics (contradicted by quantum mechanics), absolute simultaneity (contradicted by special relativity). If expert conceivability has failed repeatedly in physics, why trust it in metaphysics?

**Response:** Physics cases involve nomological possibility (what laws of nature allow), not metaphysical possibility (what reality's fundamental structure allows). The conceivability-possibility inference is most reliable when dealing with conceptual necessities—claims about whether one type of fact entails another—rather than empirical laws.

## Modal Rationalism and Its Limits

The conceivability-possibility inference embodies a form of *modal rationalism*—the view that reason can access modal truths (what is possible, necessary, or impossible) through a priori reflection.

**The rationalist bet:** Our imaginative faculties track something real about modal space. When we coherently conceive P, this isn't arbitrary—it reflects that P is compatible with the fundamental structure of reality.

**The empiricist skepticism:** Imagination is a cognitive capacity shaped by evolution and development. Why think it accurately maps metaphysical possibility rather than merely tracking what's familiar, useful, or psychologically accessible?

This debate is unresolvable without begging the question. Modal rationalists point to successful cases (mathematical and logical necessity discovered through pure reason); empiricists point to failures (geometrical and physical necessities that intuition got wrong).

## Relation to Site Perspective

The Unfinishable Map's [first tenet](/tenets/)—[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)—depends partly on conceivability arguments. The zombie argument (conceivability of physical duplicates lacking consciousness) and the knowledge argument (Mary gains new knowledge when experiencing color, showing phenomenal facts exceed physical facts) both employ conceivability-possibility reasoning.

If this inference is fundamentally unreliable, dualist arguments lose significant support. The Map's position thus requires at least *qualified* defense of the inference.

**The qualification:** The Map endorses the inference for *ideal positive conceivability* of fundamental conceptual separations, not for all conceivable scenarios. When we can coherently and completely imagine consciousness coming apart from physical structure, this reveals that consciousness is not conceptually entailed by physics—which is precisely what dualism claims.

This aligns with the [Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits) tenet. The parsimony objection to dualism often assumes that conceivability arguments are mere "intuitions" to be overridden by simplicity. But if conceivability provides genuine epistemic access to modal structure, then the apparent simplicity of physicalism might reflect ignorance rather than insight—we fail to grasp the additional facts about consciousness because we're looking only at physical structure.

The Map's position is not that all conceivable scenarios are possible, but that when sustained, rigorous imaginative reflection reveals a conceptual gap—as between physical and phenomenal—this gap is evidentially significant. Dismissing it requires either showing the conceiving is pseudo-conceiving (contains hidden contradictions) or rejecting modal rationalism entirely (abandoning reason as a guide to possibility).

Both moves carry costs. The first requires demonstrating where zombie conceiving goes wrong—and decades of scrutiny haven't produced consensus that it does. The second abandons a priori modal reasoning altogether, making necessity and possibility empirically inaccessible—a radical skepticism that undermines much of philosophy and mathematics.
