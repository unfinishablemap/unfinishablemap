Downward causation is the thesis that higher-level properties can causally influence lower-level processes. When your decision to speak causes neurons to fire, this is downward causation—mental properties affecting physical events. This concept is central to defending the site's [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet against Jaegwon Kim's exclusion argument. Kim contends that physical causes "screen off" higher-level causes, draining all causal efficacy to fundamental physics. This site's quantum framework provides a response: consciousness causally influences physical outcomes at points where physics is genuinely incomplete.

## The Concept Distinguished

Downward causation occurs when properties at one level of organization causally affect processes at lower levels. Examples abound:

- **Mental→physical**: Deciding to raise your arm causes neural firing patterns
- **Biological→chemical**: Gene regulatory networks control when specific proteins are synthesized
- **Social→individual**: Economic recessions affect individual spending decisions

The term was introduced by Donald Campbell in 1974, though the idea traces to the British emergentists (Broad, Alexander, Morgan) who defended irreducible higher-level causation in the early twentieth century.

Downward causation is distinct from, though related to, several adjacent concepts:

**[Mental causation](/concepts/mental-causation/)** is a specific instance—the mind affecting the body. All mental causation is downward causation, but downward causation extends beyond the mental to include any higher-to-lower causal influence.

**[Strong emergence](/concepts/emergence/)** implies downward causation. If higher-level properties possess genuinely novel causal powers, those powers must influence lower-level processes somehow. Conversely, if downward causation is impossible, strong emergence fails.

**Supervenience** creates tension with downward causation. If higher-level properties supervene on lower-level properties—no higher-level difference without lower-level difference—then the lower level seems to do all the causal work.

## Kim's Causal Exclusion Argument

Jaegwon Kim's exclusion argument is the most influential contemporary challenge to downward causation. The argument appears most fully developed in *Physicalism, or Something Near Enough* (2005):

1. **Causal closure**: Every physical event that has a cause has a sufficient physical cause
2. **Higher-level causation**: Higher-level properties cause lower-level effects (common-sense premise)
3. **No systematic overdetermination**: Higher-level causes don't overdetermine lower-level effects alongside lower-level causes
4. **Non-reductionism**: Higher-level properties are not identical to lower-level properties

These premises are jointly inconsistent. If physical causes are sufficient (premise 1), and higher-level causes aren't identical to physical causes (premise 4), then higher-level causation either:
- Overdetermines effects (violating premise 3), or
- Doesn't occur at all (denying premise 2)

Kim concludes that higher-level properties—including mental properties—are causally excluded by their physical realizers. Either consciousness causes nothing ([epiphenomenalism](/arguments/epiphenomenalism/)), or consciousness just *is* its physical realizer (reductionism).

## The Drainage Problem

Kim's argument implies that causal efficacy "drains" from higher levels to lower levels, eventually pooling at fundamental physics.

Consider the causal chain when you decide to drink coffee:

- Your desire for coffee (mental level)
- Neural activity in motor cortex (neural level)
- Ion channels opening and closing (molecular level)
- Electromagnetic forces on charged particles (physical level)

If each level has sufficient causes at the level below, the higher levels seem causally redundant. The molecular events have sufficient electromagnetic causes; the neural events have sufficient molecular causes; the mental events have sufficient neural causes. Causal efficacy drains downward.

This drainage threatens not just mental causation but *all* higher-level causation. Does temperature cause anything, or just molecular motion? Does predator pressure cause evolutionary change, or just differential reproductive success? Kim acknowledged this generalisation undermines the plausibility of his conclusion—if nothing above fundamental physics causes anything, we should doubt the argument rather than accept the conclusion.

## The Overdetermination Problem

One response to exclusion: perhaps mental and physical causes both contribute. Both your desire for coffee *and* your neural states cause your arm to reach for the cup.

Kim argues this systematic overdetermination is untenable. When two firing squads simultaneously shoot a prisoner, either could have killed him alone—this is genuine overdetermination. But it's coincidental. If *every* action were overdetermined by both mental and physical causes, this would require an intolerable coincidence: two independent causal chains reliably converging on identical effects.

Responses to the overdetermination charge:

**The dependence response**: Mental and physical causes aren't independent—mental properties depend on (supervene on) physical properties. The two "causes" are intimately related, making their convergence non-coincidental.

**The proportionality response**: Stephen Yablo argues mental and physical properties relate as determinables to determinates (as "red" relates to "scarlet"). The mental property may be the more proportional cause—neither too specific nor too general for the effect. You reached for coffee because you wanted coffee, not because neurons 1742-1758 fired at 47 Hz.

**The levels response**: Mental and physical descriptions capture the same causal process at different levels. It's not two causes but one cause under two descriptions—though this risks sliding toward the identity theory Kim's argument was meant to establish.

## Major Responses to the Exclusion Argument

### Interventionism

James Woodward's interventionist theory defines causes as factors whose manipulation would change effects. On this view, mental properties can be genuine causes if intervening on them (while holding other factors fixed) would produce different outcomes.

Thomas Kroedel argues that interventionism vindicates downward causation. The exclusion argument assumes a "building block" model where causation flows upward from fundamental physics. Interventionism replaces this with a counterfactual model where causation can flow in any direction if the counterfactual dependencies hold.

Critics respond that interventionism may not be applicable to mental causation—can we genuinely intervene on mental properties while holding neural properties fixed, given supervenience?

### Inheritance and Constitution

Mental properties might "inherit" causal powers from their physical realizers through intimate relations: constitution, grounding, or implementation. The mental isn't a rival to the physical but operates *through* it.

On this view, saying "your desire caused your action" and "your neural state caused your action" aren't competing claims. The desire *is* constituted by the neural state and exercises its powers through that constitution. There's one causal process, not two.

This defuses exclusion but risks losing the distinctiveness of mental causation. If mental causation just *is* physical causation under another description, what work does the mental do?

### O'Connor-Wong: Structural Emergence with Novel Powers

Timothy O'Connor and Hong Yu Wong develop a sophisticated defence of strong emergence with genuine downward causation. Their account holds that emergent properties possess "fundamentally novel" causal powers—powers not present in or derivable from component properties.

Key elements:

**Structural triggering conditions**: Emergent powers are latent until components organise appropriately. The power isn't in the parts but manifests when parts achieve the right configuration.

**Novel causal powers**: Emergent properties do something new—they don't merely summarise or redescribe what components do. Consciousness, on this view, has causal powers neurons lack.

**Denial of causal closure**: O'Connor and Wong accept that strong emergence requires rejecting causal closure. The physical story is *not* complete; higher-level organisation adds something new.

Their view faces Kim's exclusion challenge directly. If the physical base is sufficient for the effect, emergent properties are screened off. O'Connor and Wong respond: the physical base is *not* sufficient. Organisation contributes something the parts alone cannot provide.

The challenge: *how* does organisation contribute? What mechanism allows configurations to have powers their parts lack? O'Connor and Wong gesture toward "structural triggering conditions" but don't specify the mechanism. This leaves their position vulnerable—it names the problem more than solves it.

## The Quantum Opening

This site provides what O'Connor-Wong's emergentism lacks: a mechanism for downward causation that doesn't require violating physical law.

### Why Quantum Mechanics Matters

Classical physics was deterministic—every physical event had sufficient physical causes, leaving no opening for higher-level causation. But quantum mechanics is fundamentally indeterministic. The Schrödinger equation governs continuous evolution, but measurement outcomes are probabilistic. Physics specifies which outcomes *might* occur and with what probability, but not *which* outcome actualises.

This is precisely the opening downward causation requires. Kim's argument depends on physical causes being *sufficient*—if they're merely necessary, there's room for other causal factors. At quantum indeterminacies, physics provides necessary but not sufficient causes. The probabilities constrain but don't determine.

### The Minimal Quantum Interaction Mechanism

The site's [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) tenet specifies how consciousness exercises downward causation: by biasing quantum outcomes where physics leaves the result undetermined.

Henry Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism provides a concrete proposal. When you sustain attention on a neural pattern, you repeatedly "observe" the quantum states involved, holding them in place through the quantum Zeno effect (a watched pot that really never boils). This is downward causation—your attention (mental level) influences which neural patterns (physical level) become actual.

Key features:

**No energy injection**: Consciousness selects among outcomes that physics already allows, all of which conserve energy. No conservation law is violated.

**Operates at incompleteness**: Consciousness acts where physics specifies probabilities, not outcomes. There's no sufficient physical cause to be excluded by.

**Answers Kim**: The exclusion argument fails at quantum indeterminacies because its key premise—causal closure—fails there. Physics is genuinely incomplete at measurement.

### How This Differs from Classical Emergentism

British emergentists affirmed downward causation but couldn't explain it. They accepted it with "natural piety"—brute facts about what higher-level properties do, without explaining how. This left them vulnerable to exclusion arguments.

The quantum framework improves on this in three ways:

| Feature | Classical Emergentism | Quantum Interactionism |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Mechanism | None specified | Quantum Zeno effect / Orch OR |
| Where it operates | Unspecified | Quantum indeterminacies |
| Relation to physics | Requires violating closure | Exploits genuine incompleteness |
| Testability | Difficult | Makes empirical predictions |

The site specifies *where* downward causation operates (quantum indeterminacies in neural systems), *how* it operates (biasing probabilities rather than injecting energy), and *why* physical laws aren't violated (physics provides probabilities, not outcomes, at these points).

## Weak vs. Strong Downward Causation

Some philosophers distinguish weak from strong downward causation:

**Weak downward causation**: Higher-level properties causally contribute by *organising* lower-level processes, but the higher level's causal contribution reduces to the aggregate effect of lower-level causes. Temperature affecting molecular behaviour would be weak downward causation—the temperature *is* the mean molecular kinetic energy, so its causal contribution reduces to molecular causation.

**Strong downward causation**: Higher-level properties have genuinely novel causal powers irreducible to component-level causation. Consciousness affecting neurons would be strong downward causation if consciousness adds something beyond what neural aggregates provide.

Kim's exclusion argument targets strong downward causation specifically. Weak downward causation is compatible with physicalism and causal closure—it's just shorthand for talking about aggregate physical effects. Strong downward causation requires either rejecting causal closure or accepting identity (reducing the higher level to the lower).

This site defends *strong* downward causation. The Dualism tenet holds that consciousness is irreducible; the Bidirectional Interaction tenet holds it has genuine causal powers. This requires denying causal closure—which the Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet specifies where and how.

## Relation to This Site's Perspective

Downward causation is central to the site's framework.

**Bidirectional Interaction**: The site's tenet that consciousness causally influences physical outcomes *just is* the affirmation of downward causation for mental properties. Every time you decide to act and your body moves, downward causation occurs.

**The Quantum Mechanism**: The Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet specifies how downward causation works: consciousness biases quantum outcomes where physics is incomplete. This provides what classical defences of downward causation lacked—a mechanism that respects conservation laws while allowing genuine higher-level influence.

**Against Epiphenomenalism**: If downward causation fails, consciousness causes nothing—we'd have [epiphenomenalism](/arguments/epiphenomenalism/). But epiphenomenalism is self-undermining (if consciousness causes nothing, our reports about consciousness aren't caused by consciousness). Downward causation must occur.

**Strong Emergence**: The site's position is strong [emergentism](/concepts/emergence/) with a mechanism. Consciousness emerges from neural organisation but possesses genuinely novel causal powers. The quantum framework specifies how those powers operate without violating physical law.

Kim's exclusion argument remains the primary challenge. But its key premise—causal closure—fails at quantum indeterminacies. Physics provides probabilities but not outcomes. Consciousness fills this genuine gap, exercising downward causation precisely where physics runs out.
