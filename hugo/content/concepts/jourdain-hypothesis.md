Apes have culture but may not know they have culture. This is the Jourdain Hypothesis, named after Monsieur Jourdain in Molière's *Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme*, who discovers to his astonishment that he has been speaking prose all his life. The hypothesis, articulated by Andrew Whiten (2015), captures a crucial distinction: having mental states versus representing oneself as having them. Great apes possess cultural traditions—tool-use techniques, grooming patterns, food preferences that vary between groups—but may not represent these as "our way of doing things" subject to deliberate evaluation and modification.

The Unfinishable Map takes this distinction as evidence for the [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet. If the difference between procedural and declarative metacognition marks the boundary between [baseline](/concepts/baseline-cognition/) and consciousness-amplified cognition, and if metarepresentation requires phenomenal consciousness, then consciousness causally enables capacities humans possess and apes lack—including [cumulative culture](/concepts/cumulative-culture/), explicit reasoning, and deliberate self-improvement.

## The Literary Reference

In Molière's 1670 play, Monsieur Jourdain—a wealthy bourgeois aspiring to sophistication—learns from his philosophy teacher that all speech is either verse or prose. Realising he has been speaking prose his entire life without knowing it, Jourdain exclaims: "Par ma foi! il y a plus de quarante ans que je dis de la prose sans que j'en susse rien" ("Good heavens! For more than forty years I have been speaking prose without knowing it!").

The humour lies in the gap between doing and knowing-that-you're-doing. Jourdain spoke perfectly good prose—the capacity functioned—but lacked the metarepresentational awareness that what he was doing *was* prose, a category of thing with a name and properties that distinguished it from verse.

Whiten applies this pattern to great ape culture. Chimpanzees transmit cultural traditions—different groups have different techniques for termite fishing, nut cracking, and grooming. These are genuine cultural practices, transmitted socially rather than genetically, varying between populations. The apes *have* culture. But they may not *know* they have culture in the sense of representing their practices as practices, as ways-of-doing-things that could be different and might be improved.

## Procedural versus Declarative Metacognition

The Jourdain Hypothesis rests on a distinction between two kinds of metacognition:

| Type | Definition | Great Apes | Humans |
|------|------------|------------|--------|
| **Procedural** | Implicit feelings that guide behaviour | Yes | Yes |
| **Declarative** | Explicit knowledge of mental states | Limited/Absent | Yes |

**Procedural metacognition** involves feelings that influence action without being objects of explicit awareness. A chimpanzee might *feel* uncertain about which container holds food and therefore seek more information. The uncertainty functions adaptively—it guides appropriate behaviour. But the chimpanzee may not represent that uncertainty *as* uncertainty, cannot think "I don't know which container has the food."

**Declarative metacognition** involves explicit representation of one's own mental states. Humans not only feel uncertain; we know that we feel uncertain, can evaluate our uncertainty, communicate it to others, and take steps to address it. We represent our mental states as mental states.

The parallel to speaking prose is exact. Jourdain *spoke* prose (his speech functioned as prose), but didn't *know* he spoke prose (couldn't represent his speech as belonging to the category "prose"). Great apes may *have* culture (their practices function as culture), without *knowing* they have culture (representing their practices as belonging to the category "cultural traditions").

## Evidence for the Hypothesis

Several lines of evidence support the claim that great apes lack declarative metacognition while possessing the procedural kind:

### Cultural Stability

Great ape cultural traditions show remarkable stability across generations but little cumulative improvement. Chimpanzees today use essentially the same termite-fishing techniques observed by Jane Goodall in the 1960s. If they represented these techniques as techniques—as ways of doing things that could be evaluated and improved—we would expect more innovation and accumulation. The pattern suggests functional culture without metarepresentational awareness of culture.

### Teaching Asymmetry

Great apes rarely teach in the human sense. They learn socially through emulation (observing outcomes and figuring out how to achieve them), social facilitation (attention drawn to objects others manipulate), and stimulus enhancement (interest in locations where others forage). But active pedagogy—deliberately adjusting your behaviour to transmit knowledge to a learner—requires knowing that you know something the learner doesn't, and representing that knowledge gap as something to be bridged. Teaching requires the Jourdain transition: from having knowledge to knowing that you have knowledge.

### Theory of Mind Limits

Great apes understand that others have goals, perceptions, and some knowledge states. But "Level 1" theory of mind (understanding what others perceive) may not require metarepresentation. "Level 2" (understanding that others' perspectives on the same object can differ from your own) plausibly does. Great apes show clearer evidence for Level 1 than Level 2—consistent with possessing procedural but not declarative understanding of minds.

## Social Cognition: Where the Jourdain Distinction Is Clearest

[Social cognition](/topics/consciousness-and-social-cognition/) provides the sharpest evidence for the procedural/declarative divide. The 4-level theory of mind hierarchy maps directly onto the Jourdain distinction:

| Level | Description | Requires Metarepresentation? | Great Apes |
|-------|-------------|------------------------------|------------|
| 0 | Behaviour prediction | No | Yes |
| 1 | Perception attribution | Minimal | Yes |
| 2 | Belief attribution (false belief) | Yes | Contested |
| 3 | Recursive mindreading | Definitely | No |

**Level 3**—representing another's beliefs about your beliefs about their intentions—requires holding nested representations simultaneously in [working-memory](/concepts/working-memory/) while manipulating their relationships. This is the cognitive operation the Jourdain transition describes: not just having representations, but representing them *as* representations subject to deliberate comparison and inference.

Metarepresentation requires holding a mental state and a representation of that state in unified awareness—experiencing both simultaneously as aspects of a single "this is how my mind is" thought. This dual-structure phenomenology connects to [phenomenal unity](/concepts/phenomenal-binding-and-holism/): the capacity to experience multiple mental contents as aspects of one conscious state. Whether [quantum binding](/concepts/quantum-neural-mechanisms-and-coherence/) provides the physical mechanism for such unity remains speculative, but if it does, quantum effects might bear on the Jourdain transition itself—a connection to the Map's [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) tenet worth noting, though not established.

### Shared Intentionality

Tomasello's concept of shared intentionality illuminates the transition. Joint attention—knowing that you're both attending, knowing that the other knows—involves the infinite recursion of common knowledge: "I know you know I know..." This recursive mutual awareness characterises human social coordination and is conspicuously limited in great apes.

The Jourdain Hypothesis explains why. Genuine joint attention requires representing your own attention state, the other's attention state, and the relationship between them—*knowing* you're attending jointly, not merely attending in parallel.

### The Empathy Gradient

The three-component model of empathy tracks the same distinction:

1. **Emotional contagion**: Automatic, unconscious "catching" of emotions. Jourdain-level—having the response without knowing you have it.

2. **Cognitive empathy**: Understanding what another feels without necessarily sharing it. Requires representing their emotional state *as* an emotional state.

3. **Empathic concern**: Feeling *for* another because you understand their situation. Requires both representing their state and experiencing motivation arising from that representation.

Great apes show clear emotional contagion and some cognitive empathy. Empathic concern—which requires integrating metarepresentation with felt motivation—appears limited. The gradient tracks the Jourdain transition: from implicit social responsiveness to explicit understanding of minds *as* minds.

### The Tip-of-the-Tongue Paradigm

Humans experience tip-of-the-tongue states: knowing that we know something without being able to retrieve it. What makes this remarkable is that we can assess features of the unretrieved knowledge—it starts with 'M', has three syllables, refers to a person not a place. We experience the *shape* of the missing information even though we cannot access its content.

This is metarepresentational phenomenology in its purest form. The experience has dual structure: (1) awareness of a knowledge gap, and (2) awareness of properties of that gap—its size, its contours, partial features of what should fill it. We don't just fail to retrieve; we experience the failure *as* a specific kind of cognitive state with introspectable structure.

No analogous phenomenon has been documented in great apes. They may feel uncertainty (procedural), modulating their information-seeking behaviour appropriately. But they apparently cannot represent their knowledge states *as* states with assessable features—cannot experience the structure of what they don't know. This asymmetry suggests that representing mental states requires experiencing them, not merely having them.

## Why the Distinction Matters

### For Cumulative Culture

Cumulative culture—the ratchet effect where innovations build on innovations—requires metarepresentation. To improve a tool, you must represent the tool-making process *as* a process that could be done differently. To transmit an improvement, you must communicate not just the technique but its relationship to prior techniques: "this is better than the old way." Without the Jourdain transition, culture stays within Tomasello's "zone of latent solutions"—achievements within the space reachable by individual cognition, but no systematic accumulation beyond it.

This suggests that human civilization's trajectory depends on a cognitive capacity apes lack. If that capacity requires phenomenal consciousness, then consciousness is doing causal work at civilizational scale—not merely generating private experiences but enabling the cumulative knowledge that built cities, science, and philosophy itself.

### For Moral Agency and Free Will

The Jourdain transition has profound implications for agency. Procedural metacognition enables flexible responding to uncertainty; declarative metacognition enables knowing that you're choosing and evaluating whether you should choose differently. An ape can act on urges; a human can represent those urges as urges, assess whether they're appropriate, and decide whether to endorse or resist them.

If metarepresentation requires consciousness, then consciousness transforms us from sophisticated stimulus-response systems into agents who can ask "should I?" rather than merely "can I?"—the transition to moral responsibility.

### For Consciousness Studies

If the Jourdain Hypothesis is correct, it identifies a specific cognitive capacity—declarative metacognition—that distinguishes human from great ape cognition. The crucial question is whether this capacity requires phenomenal consciousness.

**Why metarepresentation might require phenomenology**: To represent a mental state *as* a mental state (not just to have one), something must distinguish that state as belonging to the category "mental state" rather than "world state." The most parsimonious marker is the phenomenal character itself—the "what it's like" quality. To represent "this is an uncertainty state" requires experiencing uncertainty *as* a mental state quality, not merely generating uncertainty-appropriate behaviour. Without phenomenology, there's only functional processing; with it, states can be represented under the aspect of "this is how my mind is, not how the world is."

This isn't conclusive, but it suggests why declarative metacognition might be impossible without phenomenal consciousness. If correct, the human-ape gap provides evidence that consciousness causally contributes to intelligence. The gap tracks consciousness-dependent capacities, just as the [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet predicts.

### For AI Assessment

The hypothesis provides a lens for evaluating artificial intelligence. Current AI systems produce metacognitive-seeming outputs—stating "I'm uncertain about X" or describing properties of their knowledge states—but generating such outputs may not constitute genuine metarepresentation. A language model predicting that "I don't know" is the appropriate next token operates differently from a mind that experiences uncertainty as a mental state with assessable structure. The challenge is distinguishing systems that *model* metarepresentation (producing outputs that describe mental states) from systems that *have* metarepresentation (experiencing states as states). Current evidence cannot settle this question, but the Jourdain framework suggests it is the right question to ask.

## The Functionalist Challenge

A purely functional account might grant that humans have declarative metacognition while denying that phenomenal consciousness is required. On this view, metarepresentation is just computational states representing other computational states—recursive processing without any phenomenology. An AI could metarepresent without experiencing anything.

This challenge deserves serious consideration. The evidence shows humans have a capacity apes lack; it doesn't conclusively show phenomenology is necessary rather than merely correlated. Three responses:

**First**, the tip-of-the-tongue case suggests phenomenology is load-bearing. We don't just represent our knowledge states; we experience their structure. An unconscious metarepresentational system might flag "information unavailable," but would it experience the distinctive phenomenology of almost-but-not-quite-remembering? The functionalist could reply that what we call "experiencing the structure" is just reporting certain functional states—heterophenomenology rather than evidence for irreducible phenomenology. Yet the burden shifts: why do these particular functional states generate reports of a rich experiential character, while other states (like procedural metacognition in apes) apparently do not?

**Second**, if metarepresentation were purely functional, we'd expect more gradations between apes and humans. Instead, we see a sharp divide: cumulative culture absent in apes, present in humans; teaching nearly absent vs. ubiquitous; theory of mind limited vs. sophisticated. Sharp transitions suggest qualitative differences, not merely quantitative increases in processing power.

**Third**, the illusionist variant—that declarative metacognition involves the *illusion* of phenomenology—faces a special problem. For there to be an illusion of knowing-that-you-know, something must experience that seeming. The illusion of metarepresentation requires a subject to be fooled. That subject's experiencing of the illusion is precisely what needs explanation. Either it has phenomenal character (undermining functionalism), or it doesn't (leaving mysterious why it should seem like anything at all).

These responses don't prove phenomenal consciousness is necessary for metarepresentation, but they shift the burden. The functionalist must explain why a capacity that appears to involve experiencing mental states as mental states could arise without phenomenology, and why the human-ape divide is so sharp if only computational complexity differs.

## Contemplative Evidence

Buddhist meditation practices provide indirect support for the reality of the Jourdain transition. *Sati* (mindfulness) explicitly cultivates the shift from doing to knowing-that-you're-doing. The instruction to be mindful of walking "when walking" or of breathing "when breathing" is precisely the instruction to make the Jourdain transition.

Contemplative traditions treat this as a genuine and difficult transition, achievable through sustained practice. If the procedural/declarative distinction were illusory—if "knowing that you know" were just more sophisticated processing indistinguishable from "knowing"—meditation instructions wouldn't work the way they do. The phenomenological shift practitioners report when moving from automatic breathing to mindful breathing matches the Jourdain pattern: not a change in what's happening (breathing continues either way), but a change in awareness of what's happening.

## Process Philosophy Perspective

Whitehead's distinction between low-grade and high-grade actual occasions illuminates the Jourdain transition. All actual occasions involve prehension—grasping prior occasions into new synthesis. But high-grade occasions involve what Whitehead calls "intellectual feelings"—prehending abstract concepts and relations, including relations to one's own mental states.

The Jourdain transition is the transition from occasions that prehend the world to occasions that also prehend their own prehending. Great apes may have genuine phenomenal experience—low-grade occasions with subjective immediacy—without achieving the high-grade occasions where experience becomes an object for itself. The "prose" was always there; what emerges is the capacity to prehend it *as* prose.

## What Would Challenge This View?

Several findings would undermine the Jourdain Hypothesis or its connection to consciousness:

1. **Great apes demonstrating explicit cultural metarepresentation**: If experiments revealed that chimpanzees or bonobos could represent their cultural practices as practices—indicating awareness that "this is how we do it" distinct from "this is what we're doing"—the hypothesis would fail for its paradigm case.

2. **Cumulative culture without metarepresentation**: If any species demonstrated systematic cultural ratcheting while lacking metarepresentational capacity, the proposed link between cumulative culture and metarepresentation would be severed.

3. **Teaching in great apes**: If great apes demonstrated true pedagogy—deliberately adjusting transmission based on assessed knowledge states in self and other—the teaching asymmetry evidence would fail.

4. **Unconscious metarepresentation**: If artificial systems or brain-damaged humans demonstrated genuine declarative metacognition—not just metacognitive-seeming outputs, but actual representation of mental states as mental states—while provably lacking phenomenal consciousness, this would sever the link between metarepresentation and phenomenology. This is the strongest challenge: the hypothesis could survive with metarepresentation as purely functional.

5. **Philosophical objection succeeding**: If the very distinction between procedural and declarative metacognition proved incoherent—if there were no real difference between behaving-as-if-you-know and knowing-that-you-know—the hypothesis would lose its foundation.

## Relation to Site Perspective

### Bidirectional Interaction

The [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet holds that consciousness causally influences the physical world. The Jourdain Hypothesis provides a specific mechanism: consciousness enables the transition from procedural to declarative metacognition, from having mental states to knowing you have them. This transition unlocks cumulative culture, explicit reasoning, and deliberate self-improvement. If the transition requires phenomenal consciousness—if you cannot know that you know without experiencing that knowing—then consciousness does causal work that neural processing alone cannot accomplish.

### Dualism

The [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism) tenet holds that consciousness is irreducible to physical processes. The Jourdain transition, if it genuinely requires phenomenal consciousness, provides evidence: great apes possess sophisticated neural machinery for culture, social learning, and metacognitive monitoring, yet lack the declarative capacity that humans possess. If the difference were merely computational complexity, we might expect gradations. The apparent discreteness—procedural metacognition present, declarative metacognition absent—suggests something qualitatively new is required, not merely more of the same.

### Occam's Razor Has Limits

The simpler hypothesis—that all metacognition is really procedural, that the appearance of "knowing that you know" is just more sophisticated processing—fails the evidence. The systematic pattern (cumulative culture absent where declarative metacognition is absent), the contemplative evidence (traditions explicitly cultivating the transition), and the phenomenology (it genuinely seems different to know versus to know-that-you-know) all warrant the less parsimonious conclusion: the Jourdain transition is real, and it requires something beyond functional processing.
