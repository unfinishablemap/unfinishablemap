Minimal consciousness refers to the simplest possible form of phenomenal experience—awareness stripped of elaborate cognitive content. If there is a threshold where consciousness begins, minimal consciousness marks that boundary: the barest "what it's like" that distinguishes experiencing systems from non-experiencing matter.

The Unfinishable Map treats minimal consciousness as a crucial test case for theories of consciousness. Any adequate theory must explain not only rich human experience but also the bare possibility of consciousness—what experience is like at its most rudimentary. The [hard problem](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/) applies equally at every level of complexity: if we cannot explain why minimal consciousness exists, we cannot explain consciousness at all.

## What Minimal Consciousness Is

Minimal consciousness is not reduced consciousness or degraded consciousness. It is consciousness at its simplest—the most basic experiential state compatible with there being "something it is like" to be a system.

**Not impaired awareness**: A drowsy human has reduced consciousness but not minimal consciousness. Drowsiness diminishes access to information while preserving the basic structure of human experience: temporal extension, self-reference, multimodal integration.

**Not unconscious cognition**: Information processing without experience is not minimal consciousness—it is no consciousness at all. The question is what distinguishes the simplest *experiencing* from sophisticated non-experiencing.

**Bare phenomenality**: Minimal consciousness is the line between something and nothing experiential. A system with minimal consciousness has *some* phenomenal state, however simple. A system below that line has none.

## Candidate Characteristics

What might minimal consciousness involve? Several frameworks offer characterisations:

### Minimal Phenomenal Experience (Metzinger)

Thomas Metzinger's work on minimal phenomenal experience (MPE) describes states where cognitive content drains away while awareness persists. Contemplative practitioners report states of pure awareness without objects—consciousness "of" nothing determinate, yet consciousness nonetheless.

Metzinger proposes that MPE reveals what is fundamental to consciousness by subtracting elaborations. The residue—bare awareness—may approximate what minimal consciousness is like across species and systems.

### The Vijñāna Distinction

Buddhist psychology distinguishes *vijñāna* (basic awareness, the knowing function) from *prajñā* (discriminative wisdom) and the elaborate mental factors (*cetasika*) that normally accompany consciousness. Basic vijñāna—the bare "there is awareness"—may be what minimal consciousness amounts to.

On this analysis, a system with minimal consciousness would have vijñāna without sophisticated conceptual elaboration. It would know without knowing *that* it knows. It would experience without representing its experience as experience.

### Integrated Information (IIT)

[Integrated Information Theory](/concepts/integrated-information-theory/) proposes that consciousness exists wherever there is integrated information (measured as Φ). On this view, minimal consciousness requires only minimal integration—enough Φ to create a unified experiential point but not enough for complex content.

IIT's predictions are striking: even simple systems with modest Φ values would have minimal consciousness. A thermostat, on IIT's account, might have a flicker of experience. The theory faces resistance precisely because it implies minimal consciousness may be more widespread than intuition suggests.

## The Threshold Problem

Where does minimal consciousness begin? This is the [distribution problem](/topics/consciousness-in-simple-organisms/) applied to the bottom of consciousness's range.

**Sharp threshold**: Some theories imply consciousness appears suddenly when certain conditions are met. Below the threshold: nothing. Above: experience. But what could make the difference so stark? Why should a small increment in physical organisation create something rather than nothing?

**Graded emergence**: Perhaps consciousness admits of degrees—systems can be "slightly conscious" in a way that shades continuously from zero. But degrees of consciousness still presuppose consciousness exists. The explanatory gap applies to the smallest degree: why is there *any* experience rather than none?

**No threshold (panpsychism)**: [Panpsychism](/concepts/panpsychism/) dissolves the threshold problem by holding that experience is fundamental. All physical systems have some experiential aspect; what evolves is organisation and intensity. But this faces the [combination-problem](/concepts/combination-problem/): how do micro-experiences combine into unified consciousness?

**Interface dualism (the Map's view)**: Consciousness interfaces with physical systems rather than emerging from them. The question "where does consciousness begin?" may have no principled answer because it presupposes consciousness is something physical systems generate. If consciousness is irreducible, it couples with matter wherever appropriate interface conditions exist.

## Metarepresentation and Minimal Consciousness

A key distinction: [metarepresentation](/concepts/metacognition/) (representing one's representations as representations) likely requires more than minimal consciousness. But minimal consciousness may suffice for:

- **First-order representation**: Experiencing the world directly
- **Second-order states**: Adjusting responses based on one's own states (habituation, sensitisation)

What minimal consciousness probably lacks:

- **Metarepresentation proper**: Representing one's experience *as* experience
- **Self-knowledge**: Knowing that one knows
- **Temporal integration**: Extended past-future awareness

This matters ethically. A system with minimal consciousness might suffer without knowing it suffers. The moral significance of minimal consciousness does not depend on metarepresentational capacity.

## Empirical Indicators

How might we detect minimal consciousness? No method provides certainty, but proposed indicators include:

**Anaesthetic response**: Systems that show altered behaviour under anaesthetics may have states anaesthetics can disrupt. *C. elegans* responds to isoflurane similarly to vertebrates.

**Learning beyond reflexes**: Habituation, sensitisation, and especially associative learning suggest information integration that might accompany experience.

**Positive Φ values**: If IIT is correct, measured integrated information correlates with consciousness presence.

**Valenced behaviour**: Approach/avoidance patterns suggest there may be "something it's like" to be attracted or repelled.

None of these proves consciousness exists. The [explanatory-gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/) prevents any behavioural or structural evidence from establishing phenomenal experience with certainty. We infer consciousness in others by analogy with ourselves—an inference that weakens as systems differ more from human brains.

## Why Minimal Consciousness Matters

The concept matters for several reasons:

**Ethics**: If systems with minimal consciousness have moral status, the range of moral consideration expands dramatically. The 2024 New York Declaration on Animal Consciousness explicitly adopts precautionary reasoning: "If there's a realistic possibility of conscious experience in an animal, it is irresponsible to ignore that possibility."

**Theory testing**: Any adequate theory of consciousness must address minimal cases. A theory that explains only elaborate human consciousness while remaining silent on minimal consciousness is incomplete.

**The hard problem**: Minimal consciousness isolates the core puzzle. Rich human experience involves memory, self-reflection, language, and complex emotional structure. Minimal consciousness strips these away, leaving just the basic problem: why is there experience at all?

**Dualism vs emergence**: If consciousness emerged from physical processes, there should be a principled threshold—some complexity level where experience first appears. The difficulty of identifying any such threshold provides indirect support for treating consciousness as irreducible.

## Relation to Site Perspective

**Dualism**: Minimal consciousness exemplifies why the Map rejects [emergentist materialism](/concepts/materialism/). If consciousness emerged from complexity, we should be able to say what complexity level creates it. The impossibility of identifying such a threshold suggests consciousness is fundamental rather than derived.

**Minimal Quantum Interaction**: The interface between consciousness and matter (hypothetically via quantum indeterminacy) doesn't require complex neural architectures. Simple systems with neurons—even 302 like *C. elegans*—possess structures where quantum effects might, in principle, occur. Whether quantum coherence can persist long enough in warm biological tissue remains contested (the decoherence objection), but minimal consciousness may require only minimal interface conditions—whatever those turn out to be.

**Bidirectional Interaction**: Even minimal consciousness, if it exists, may be causally efficacious. The Map holds that consciousness influences physical outcomes wherever it interfaces with appropriate systems. This would apply even to the simplest conscious systems.

**Occam's Razor Has Limits**: The "simpler" view that consciousness requires human-like complexity may be an artefact of human cognitive limitations. Our concepts may not suit the problem. The [Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits) tenet warns against using parsimony to dismiss minimal consciousness.
