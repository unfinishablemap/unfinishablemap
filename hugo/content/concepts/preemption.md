Preemption is a causal structure in which one sufficient cause renders another sufficient cause idle, so that only the first does the actual causal work. Unlike overdetermination—where two sufficient causes both contribute to the same effect—preemption involves one cause *operating* while the backup is *sidelined*. The Unfinishable Map's interest in preemption centres on its role in Bradford Saad's [delegatory-dualism](/topics/delegatory-dualism/), where conscious experiences preempt the causal contributions of physical brain states, solving the exclusion problem without overdetermination.

## Preemption in the Causation Literature

Preemption has been a central case study in theories of causation since David Lewis's counterfactual analysis faced difficulties with it. The basic scenario: two events are each sufficient to cause some effect, but one "gets there first" and the other never fires.

### Early and Late Preemption

Philosophers distinguish two varieties:

**Early preemption** occurs when the preempting cause prevents the backup cause from completing its causal process. If assassin A shoots and kills the target, while assassin B *would have* shot but sees A succeed and stands down, A's shot preempts B's. The backup process is cut short before it can produce the effect.

**Late preemption** occurs when both causal processes complete, but one produces the effect fractionally before the other arrives. If both assassins fire simultaneously, but A's bullet strikes first and kills the target before B's bullet arrives, A's shot preempts B's. The backup process completes its course but is rendered causally idle because the effect has already occurred.

Late preemption posed a particular challenge for Lewis's counterfactual theory. On that theory, C causes E if E counterfactually depends on C—if C hadn't occurred, E wouldn't have occurred. But in late preemption, E would still have occurred (via the backup) even without C. Lewis refined his theory repeatedly—introducing fragility of events, chains of counterfactual dependence, and influence—largely to handle preemption cases.

### Trumping Preemption

Jonathan Schaffer introduced *trumping preemption*, a more radical variant. In trumping cases, both causes operate and both processes run to completion, yet one cause "trumps" the other by a principle of priority rather than temporal precedence. Schaffer's example: a major and a sergeant both order troops to advance. Both orders are heard. The troops advance because military hierarchy gives the major's order priority—the sergeant's order is trumped, not merely beaten temporally.

Trumping preemption is philosophically significant because it cannot be handled by appeals to temporal priority or process-cutting. The backup cause isn't prevented or beaten to the finish. It operates fully but is rendered causally idle by a structural principle of priority.

## Preemption vs. Overdetermination

The distinction between preemption and overdetermination is philosophically precise:

**Overdetermination**: Two sufficient causes both contribute to producing the effect. Each independently suffices. Remove either one and the effect still occurs via the other. Both causes do actual causal work.

**Preemption**: Two sufficient causes exist, but only one does the causal work. The other is rendered idle—it *could have* produced the effect but didn't. Remove the preempting cause and the effect would still occur (via the backup), but the actual causal history runs through the preempting cause alone.

This distinction matters because systematic overdetermination is widely regarded as theoretically problematic. If every effect has two independent sufficient causes, the backup cause appears redundant—present for no explanatory reason. Preemption avoids this: the backup cause has a role (it would have operated if needed) without being redundantly operative.

## Preemption in Philosophy of Mind

Preemption becomes philosophically urgent in the context of [mental-causation](/concepts/mental-causation/). If both mental states and physical states are sufficient to cause behaviour, do they overdetermine it? Kim's exclusion argument presses this question, concluding that non-physical mental properties are either identical to physical properties or causally inert.

### Saad's Delegatory Preemption

Bradford Saad's [delegatory-dualism](/topics/delegatory-dualism/) (2025) applies preemption—specifically trumping preemption—to the mind-body problem. The core proposal: when a conscious experience arises, it *preempts* the causal contribution of the underlying physical state. Pain causes wincing not alongside the brain state but *instead of* it—the brain state's causal role is taken over, not duplicated.

Saad's model works through two laws. The Subset Law* assigns experiences to physical states whose "default causal profile" (what the state would cause absent any experience) matches the experience's causal profile. The Delegatory Law then specifies that the experience preempts the corresponding portion of the physical state's default causal profile.

The structure is trumping, not temporal. The experience doesn't beat the physical state to the finish line. Rather, a psychophysical law of delegation gives the experience priority over the physical state's default contribution—like the major's order trumping the sergeant's by hierarchical principle.

This resolves the exclusion problem without overdetermination. The physical state and the experience are not two independently sufficient causes both contributing. One cause operates (the experience); the other is sidelined (the physical state's default contribution is preempted). The causal work is done once, not twice.

### Why Preemption Rather Than Other Structures?

Several causal structures could model mental causation. Preemption has advantages over the alternatives:

- **Overdetermination** posits redundant causation. If the physical cause suffices, the mental cause is explanatorily idle—exactly the epiphenomenalist conclusion the dualist wants to avoid.
- **Joint causation** (neither suffices alone) requires denying that the physical state is sufficient. This conflicts with what physics seems to show about causal completeness—though a physicalist would note that the completeness of physical causal chains is precisely what's at issue between dualists and physicalists.
- **Constitution** (the mental cause *is* the physical cause under another description) amounts to reductionism, abandoning dualism.
- **Preemption** preserves the physical state's *capacity* to cause the effect (respecting the spirit of physical sufficiency) while denying it *exercises* that capacity (making room for mental causation). The physical story is not violated—it is displaced.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Preemption connects to The Unfinishable Map's framework at multiple points.

**Bidirectional Interaction**: The Map's [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet affirms that consciousness causally influences physical outcomes. Preemption provides the causal structure for this influence. Consciousness doesn't compete with physical causes—it displaces them, taking over causal work that would otherwise proceed by default.

**Minimal Quantum Interaction**: The Map's quantum framework addresses the *mechanism* question (where in the physical story does consciousness act?), while Saad's preemption model addresses the *structure* question (how does mental causation avoid overdetermination?). The Map integrates both: quantum indeterminacy provides the physical substrate; delegation and preemption describe the causal logic. These frameworks complement rather than compete.

**Agent Causation**: The [agent-causal](/concepts/agent-causation/) tradition holds that substances—not prior events—originate actions directly. Agent-causal theories explain *what kind of entity* initiates causation (the conscious agent as substance), while preemption explains *how that initiation relates to the physical causal structure*: the agent's exercise of causal power preempts the physical state's default contribution. Together, substance causation and delegatory preemption answer both the ontological question (who causes?) and the structural question (how does that cause interact with physical causes?).

**Observational Closure**: Saad's model satisfies [observational-closure](/observational-closure/)—no observable violations of physical causal patterns. Preemption produces exactly the effects the physical state would have produced by default. Experiments detect no anomalies, because the causal outcome is identical whether the experience or the physical state does the work. This aligns with the Map's commitment that mental causation should not produce empirically detectable anomalies. It also raises a legitimate methodological tension: if preemption is empirically indistinguishable from purely physical causation, the case for it rests on philosophical arguments (the reality of consciousness, the failure of reductive accounts) rather than direct empirical evidence.
