If consciousness influences the physical world through attention—as The Unfinishable Map's [attention-as-interface hypothesis](/concepts/attention-as-interface/) proposes—then agency is fundamentally about how attention gets allocated over time. The deepest unit of will is not the discrete "decision" but the *sustained direction of attention*: what gets stabilised, what gets released, what gets held against competing claims. This is attentional economics—the budgeting and investment of a finite conscious resource that shapes which possibilities become actual.

The implication is striking: **freedom scales with attentional skill**. Practices that train attention—meditation, contemplative inquiry, cognitive-behavioural refocusing—are not merely therapeutic tools. They are *metaphysically agency-enhancing* within the Map's framework.

## The Economic Framing

Economics studies how agents allocate scarce resources among competing ends. Attention fits this pattern precisely:

| Economic Category | Attentional Parallel |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Scarcity | ~10 bits/second conscious bandwidth |
| Allocation | Where attention is directed |
| Investment | Sustained focus over time |
| Return | Neural pattern stabilisation, neuroplasticity |
| Opportunity cost | Alternatives that decay while unattended |

The brain processes enormous information flows unconsciously—visual processing, motor coordination, pattern recognition. Consciousness receives a tiny fraction: roughly 10 bits per second by recent estimates (Meister 2024). This severe bandwidth constraint means every moment of attention is an allocation choice. Attending here means not attending there. Sustaining focus on this means letting that decay.

This isn't metaphor. The Map's framework gives these economic concepts literal force: consciousness selects among quantum possibilities, and selection operates through attention. The scarcity is genuine (bandwidth cannot be borrowed or expanded at will), the trade-offs are real (attending here means not attending there), and the returns are measurable (sustained attention produces neuroplastic change). How you spend your attentional budget determines which neural patterns actualise.

## From Decisions to Attention Allocation

Traditional free will debates focus on discrete decisions: did you choose A or B? Could you have chosen otherwise? The attentional economics view reframes the question. The decisive exercise of agency isn't the moment of choice but the *prior allocation of attention* that shapes what options are vivid, what considerations are salient, what patterns have been stabilised.

Consider choosing between job offers. The apparent "decision moment" is when you accept one. But agency operated throughout: which aspects of each option you attended to; how long you dwelt on salary versus meaning; whether you sustained focus on long-term consequences or let them fade. By the time the "decision" arrives, attentional allocation has already structured the landscape.

This connects to distal intentions, [prospective memory](/concepts/prospective-memory/), and [counterfactual reasoning](/concepts/counterfactual-reasoning/). When you decide Monday to exercise Friday, agency doesn't wait until Friday morning. It operates through the attentional work of the intervening days: rehearsing the intention, noticing cues, sustaining the commitment against competing priorities. The Map's framework suggests this attentional work is where conscious influence actually occurs.

## Why Attention Specifically?

The [attention-as-interface](/concepts/attention-as-interface/) article develops why attention—rather than emotion, memory, or imagination—serves as consciousness's interface with matter. The economic framing adds another dimension: attention is the *bottleneck resource* that determines what consciousness can influence.

Consider the constraints:

**Bandwidth limits**: Conscious processing operates at ~10 bits/second while unconscious processing handles millions. This extreme asymmetry means consciousness can only influence coarse-grained patterns, not fine-grained neural events.

**Temporal structure**: The [quantum Zeno effect](/concepts/quantum-consciousness/#quantum-zeno-effect-stapp)—if it's the mechanism—requires *sustained* observation to stabilise patterns. Brief attention produces minimal effect; sustained attention produces neuroplasticity. This temporal requirement gives attention its economic character: time invested matters.

**Competition dynamics**: Neural patterns compete for dominance. Attention feeds some patterns while starving others. This is precisely what economic models describe: allocation of limited resources among competing uses.

## Attentional Skill as Agency Enhancement

The framework yields a practical corollary: *improving attentional skills increases the range and depth of conscious agency*.

[Contemplative practices](/concepts/meditation-and-consciousness-modes/) train different attentional capacities:

| Practice | Attentional Skill | Agency Enhancement |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Focused attention (samatha) | Sustained single-pointed focus | Ability to hold chosen patterns against distraction |
| Open monitoring (vipassana) | Non-reactive awareness | Ability to observe without compulsive selection |
| Meta-awareness | Noticing where attention has gone | Ability to redirect attention deliberately |
| Cognitive defusion | Separating attention from content | Ability to disengage from unhelpful patterns |

These aren't merely subjective improvements. Within the Map's framework, they are *expansions of conscious causal power*. A meditator who can sustain focus for thirty minutes has more "attentional capital" to invest than someone whose attention scatters every thirty seconds.

[Mental effort](/concepts/mental-effort/) phenomenology supports this interpretation. Sustaining attention *feels* effortful—there's a phenomenal cost. This felt effort corresponds to genuine work: the rapid repeated observations that, on the Zeno hypothesis, hold neural patterns stable. Training reduces the effort required for equivalent focus, which is to say it increases attentional efficiency—more stabilisation per unit of felt cost.

## The Phenomenology of Attentional Choice

The [phenomenology of choice](/concepts/phenomenology-of-choice/) reveals that choosing feels different from observing: there's a sense of active participation rather than passive reception. Attentional economics clarifies what this participation involves.

When you choose where to direct attention, you experience:

**Felt alternatives**: Multiple possible foci present themselves. This document or that notification; this thought-thread or that sensation. The alternatives feel genuinely open.

**Selection effort**: Directing attention to one option and sustaining it requires work. The effort scales with how attractive the unchosen alternatives are.

**Opportunity awareness**: You sense, at least dimly, that attending here means not attending there. The cost registers phenomenologically.

**Investment temporality**: Sustained attention feels like ongoing commitment, not instantaneous selection. You continuously renew the allocation.

This phenomenology tracks what the framework claims is happening: consciousness engaging with neural possibilities through sustained attentional focus. The felt economics of attention corresponds to the actual economics of selection.

## Attention Training Is Metaphysically Significant

This point deserves emphasis. Within the Map's framework, practices that enhance attentional control are not merely:

- **Therapeutic** (though they are—reducing anxiety, improving mood)
- **Cognitive** (though they are—enhancing working memory, executive function)
- **Practical** (though they are—improving task performance)

They are **metaphysically agency-enhancing**. They expand the scope of what consciousness can influence.

Consider the contrast with a framework where consciousness is epiphenomenal. On that view, attention training might change brain states, but consciousness isn't doing the changing—it's just along for the ride. The training's value would be purely functional, not agential.

The Map's framework inverts this. Training attention doesn't merely correlate with improved outcomes; it *expands conscious causal power*. The meditator doesn't just feel more in control—they *have more control* in the framework's own terms.

## Working Memory and Attentional Capital

[Working memory](/concepts/working-memory/) capacity—typically 4±1 items—represents the "liquid assets" of attention: what can be actively held and manipulated at once. This connects to [counterfactual reasoning](/concepts/counterfactual-reasoning/): genuine deliberation requires holding the actual situation, the counterfactual premise, and the counterfactual consequences simultaneously. Limited working memory constrains this.

The Bischof-Köhler hypothesis (Suddendorf & Corballis 2007) proposes that animals cannot act on drive states they don't currently possess because they cannot represent counterfactual states vividly enough. Great apes show working memory of roughly 2±1 items (Inoue & Matsuzawa 2007). This may explain why sophisticated cognition requiring counterfactual manipulation is largely human.

Attentional economics interprets this as a capital constraint. Limited working memory means limited attentional capital for complex deliberation. Training that expands working memory capacity or improves its efficiency expands the space of deliberation—the alternatives that can be genuinely evaluated rather than merely noticed.

## Implications for Moral Responsibility

If agency scales with attentional skill, [moral responsibility](/concepts/moral-responsibility/) gains texture. The Map already grounds desert in [agent causation](/concepts/agent-causation/)—the agent as genuine source of action. Attentional economics adds that the *extent* of authorship varies with attentional capacity.

This doesn't excuse wrongdoing—"I couldn't sustain attention on the consequences" doesn't eliminate responsibility. But it suggests:

**Mitigation scaling**: Impaired attentional capacity (addiction, trauma, developmental factors) genuinely reduces authorship even if it doesn't eliminate it.

**Character cultivation**: Developing attentional skills over time is itself an exercise of agency. You are responsible not just for choices but for cultivating or neglecting the capacity to choose well.

**Structural factors**: Social conditions that chronically drain attention (poverty, stress, instability) reduce the attentional capital available for agency. This has ethical implications beyond individual character—connecting attentional economics to broader questions of moral luck and social justice.

## The Economics of Witness Mode

Meditation reveals that consciousness can *refrain from selecting*—entering what the Map calls "witness mode." This complicates the economic framing in illuminating ways.

In ordinary attention, the scarce resource gets allocated among competing options. In witness mode, attention doesn't select among contents but holds the entire field equanimously. This isn't the same as divided attention (allocating bandwidth across multiple foci); it's a different mode entirely.

Economically, witness mode resembles holding assets in reserve—maintaining liquidity rather than committing to specific investments. The capacity for witness mode suggests attentional capital isn't just about *how much* you can invest but *whether* to invest at all.

The three-level structure emerges:
1. **Selection among options** (ordinary agency)
2. **Refraining from selection** (witness mode)
3. **Choosing which mode to operate in** (meta-level agency)

Each level represents a domain of attentional economics, and training can operate at each level.

## Habituation and the Boundaries of the Attentional Economy

The attentional economy has a structural limit that operates independently of bandwidth: *habituation*. When experiences become sufficiently familiar, they drop out of phenomenal awareness even while remaining functionally processed. You navigate your kitchen expertly without consciously attending to any of it. The familiar becomes invisible—what Viktor Shklovsky called "automatization."

This creates a boundary condition for attentional economics. The options available for attentional allocation aren't fixed; they shrink as habituation removes contents from the phenomenal field. A narrower economy operates on what remains visible to consciousness.

| Attentional Status | Economic Role |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Novel/salient | Available for allocation (full economy) |
| Familiar but attendable | Available with effort (reduced liquidity) |
| Fully habituated | Unavailable (outside the economy) |

This has implications for agency. Habituation doesn't just reduce phenomenal richness—it *contracts* the scope of conscious influence. What has dropped out of awareness can no longer be the target of attentional selection. The meditator isn't just learning to focus more intensely; they're learning to *de-habituate*—to restore the familiar to the phenomenal field and thereby expand the attentional economy.

"Beginner's mind" (*shoshin*) in Zen practice names this precisely: seeing the familiar as if for the first time. The practice doesn't create new contents; it restores contents that habituation had removed from conscious access. Each moment of successful de-habituation expands the set of options available for attentional investment.

The habituation boundary also explains why attention training requires ongoing practice. Habituation is structural, not motivational—it reasserts itself automatically. Maintaining an expanded attentional economy requires continuous counteraction against the natural contraction that familiarity produces. This is why contemplative traditions emphasise *sustained practice* rather than one-time insight: the boundary keeps trying to close.

## Objections and Responses

**"This is just folk psychology dressed up as metaphysics."**

The framework makes claims beyond folk psychology: that attention operates through quantum mechanisms, that selection literally determines which neural patterns actualise, that training attention expands conscious causal power. These claims are empirically constrained and potentially falsifiable. Folk psychology doesn't commit to quantum Zeno effects or bandwidth limits; the Map's framework does.

**"Attention training benefits could be purely neural, with consciousness as epiphenomenal spectator."**

This objection applies to any evidence for mental causation. The Map's response: if consciousness were epiphenomenal, the correlation between felt effort and neural outcomes would be coincidental. The [argument from reason](/topics/argument-from-reason/) provides additional support: rational inference requires tracking normative relationships, which pure computation cannot instantiate.

**"The bandwidth limit undermines agency rather than grounding it."**

The bandwidth limit constrains *what* consciousness can influence, not *whether* it influences. A CEO doesn't lose agency by having limited time; the limits structure how agency gets exercised. Similarly, attentional bandwidth limits structure conscious agency without eliminating it.

## Relation to Site Perspective

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: Attentional economics presupposes consciousness is distinct from the attentional mechanisms it operates through. The scarce resource being allocated is *conscious attention*—something irreducible to neural processing.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)**: The framework specifies *how* consciousness influences matter: through the allocation of attention, which stabilises certain neural patterns over others. Attention is the currency of mental causation.

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)**: The bandwidth constraint (~10 bits/second) reflects the minimality. Consciousness doesn't override brain processing; it selects among results through a narrow channel.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)**: Attentional economics requires genuine selection. If all patterns actualised in parallel branches, there would be nothing for attention to allocate—no scarcity, no opportunity costs, no investment returns.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)**: The framework adds complexity (quantum mechanisms, bandwidth constraints, economic structure) but explains what simpler accounts cannot: why attention feels effortful, why training produces neuroplastic change, why sustained focus differs from brief notice.

## Summary

Attentional economics reframes agency from discrete decisions to the ongoing allocation of a scarce conscious resource. The deepest unit of will is sustained attention—what gets stabilised, what gets released, what competes for limited bandwidth.

The practical implication is significant: **attention training is metaphysically agency-enhancing**. Meditation, contemplative practice, and cognitive-behavioural techniques don't merely improve subjective well-being. Within the Map's framework, they expand the scope and depth of conscious causal power. Freedom scales with attentional skill.

This connects the abstract commitments of the tenets—dualism, bidirectional interaction, minimal quantum influence—to lived practice. The Map's framework isn't just a philosophical position to believe. It's a framework that suggests specific interventions (attention training) have specific metaphysical payoffs (expanded agency). The economics of attention bridges theory and practice.
