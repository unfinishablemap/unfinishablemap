Henri Bergson's concept of *durée* (duration) names the qualitative experience of time as consciousness lives it—fundamentally different from clock time or the spatialized time of physics. When you listen to a melody, you don't experience a succession of separate notes arranged along a timeline. You experience the melody *as a whole*, with each note permeated by the ones before and reaching toward those to come. This flowing, interpenetrating, qualitative time is durée.

Bergson argued that modern science systematically misunderstands time by spatializing it—treating moments as points on a line, like beads on a string. This representation is useful for measurement but misses what time actually is for a conscious being. Durée cannot be measured because it cannot be divided without destroying what it is. Cut a melody into separate notes and you have frequencies, not music.

This matters for consciousness studies because durée may name exactly what physical descriptions leave out. If Bergson is right, the "missing link" in consciousness theories—their failure to explain experienced duration—is not a gap to be filled but evidence of an irreducible dimension that science's spatialized time cannot capture.

## Duration vs. Spatialized Time

Bergson distinguishes two ways of apprehending time:

**Spatialized time** treats moments as positions in a medium—3:00 PM as a point on a clock face, distinct from 3:01 PM. Scientific time is homogeneous, measurable, quantifiable.

**Duration** is time as consciousness experiences it. The past lives in the present; the future already colours current experience. States don't sit beside each other like objects in space—they interpenetrate. An hour of waiting feels different from an hour of absorption. Duration is heterogeneous, qualitative, indivisible.

The distinction parallels external versus internal. We observe a clock from outside; we cannot step outside our own duration. Any attempt to represent duration spatially transforms it into something else. As Bergson wrote: "Time is invention or it is nothing at all." The physicist's equations are time-reversible; durée is not.

## Qualitative Multiplicity

Bergson's key technical concept is "qualitative multiplicity"—unity in difference without juxtaposition. In ordinary multiplicity, elements are distinct and countable. In qualitative multiplicity, elements interpenetrate while remaining distinguishable, each coloured by every other.

A musical phrase exemplifies this. Each note is heard *in light of* what came before and *in anticipation of* what follows. The notes don't fuse into undifferentiated unity; they remain distinguishable yet interpenetrating. Consciousness, Bergson argues, is fundamentally this kind of multiplicity—mental states interpenetrate as dimensions of a unified experiential field, not separable elements.

## Duration and Free Will

Bergson connected durée directly to [free will](/topics/free-will/). His first major work, *Time and Free Will* (1889), argued that the apparent conflict between freedom and determinism rests on a confusion—treating lived duration as if it were spatialized time.

Determinism assumes that mental states are discrete, separable, and subject to causal law: state A causes state B with the same necessity as billiard ball A causes billiard ball B to move. But if mental states interpenetrate in qualitative multiplicity, this model fails. There's no distinct "state A" to serve as cause. The whole of one's past converges in each moment, not as a sum of separate influences but as an indivisible movement.

A free act, for Bergson, is one that emerges from the whole self—from the full depth of one's duration. Unfree acts are those where we act superficially, from habit or social convention, without engaging our genuine selves. Freedom is not arbitrary choice between pre-defined options but creative expression of who we are becoming.

This connects to The Unfinishable Map's [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet. If consciousness genuinely influences the physical world, it does so in time—in durée. The creative novelty Bergson attributes to duration is precisely the opening where consciousness might exercise causal power. Determinism fails not because events are random but because lived time is creative rather than merely repetitive.

## The "Missing Link" in Consciousness Theories

Contemporary researchers have identified a critical gap: major theories of consciousness fail to account for experienced duration. IIT and Global Workspace Theory focus on "functional moments" of 100-300 milliseconds, but experienced time extends to seconds. Kent and Wittmann (2021) call this "one of the core issues in theories of consciousness."

Bergson's framework suggests why this gap persists. The theories spatialize time—treating consciousness as discrete states. But durée is an indivisible flow where each moment contains the whole past. Explaining discrete moments cannot explain duration because duration is not made of discrete moments. This supports the [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism) tenet: the gap may be evidence that something escapes physical description altogether.

## Contemplative Access to Durée

[Neurophenomenology](/concepts/neurophenomenology/) provides empirical support for Bergson's claims. Long-term meditators report systematic access to the temporal microstructure of experience—the interpenetrating flow of past, present, and future.

Husserl analyzed time-consciousness into retention (the just-past echoing in the now), primal impression (the present moment), and protention (anticipation). Contemplative practice reveals this structure experientially. Buddhist *khanika* (momentariness) initially seems to contradict durée's continuous flow, but contemplative phenomenology reveals both: discrete phases of consciousness, yet each interpenetrated by predecessors. Claire Petitmengin's microphenomenology techniques elicit fine-grained descriptions of temporal micro-dynamics—evidence that durée is a describable experiential structure.

Perhaps most striking, advanced meditators can voluntarily enter *nirodha samapatti*—cessation of perception and feeling. In this state, subjective time stops entirely. When meditators emerge, they report not shortened time but complete absence of temporal experience. This provides negative evidence: when durée stops, there is no experience at all. Duration is not a feature of experience but its fundamental medium.

[Witness consciousness](/concepts/witness-consciousness/) further supports durée's reality: meditators can observe the interpenetrating flow rather than merely living it, demonstrating that durée is phenomenally accessible when attention is sufficiently refined.

## Embodied Duration

Recent research connects time experience to bodily rhythms—the insula processing interoceptive signals like heartbeat and breathing. Duration may be essentially embodied, with implications for [AI consciousness](/topics/ai-consciousness/): if durée is lived through a body, disembodied systems may be categorically incapable of temporal experience. Processing timestamps is not experiencing duration. A living body carries its past in its tissues; a computer carries data in storage.

## Durée and Quantum Collapse

Bergson's qualitative multiplicity resembles quantum superposition: multiple possibilities interpenetrating rather than existing as definite, separable states. Perhaps the "collapse" that creates each present moment is analogous to—or identical with—quantum collapse.

The [collapse-and-time](/concepts/collapse-and-time/) connection develops this speculation. If consciousness participates in quantum collapse and collapse introduces the arrow of time, durée may be phenomenologically apprehending what physics mathematically describes. The irreversibility of lived time—you cannot un-hear a melody—may reflect the deeper irreversibility of collapse itself.

### The Decoherence Challenge

Critics argue that [decoherence](/concepts/decoherence/) destroys superposition in 10⁻¹³ seconds—far shorter than the multi-second spans of durée. Three considerations mitigate this: (1) Hagan et al. (2002) found coherence times seven orders of magnitude longer than Tegmark's estimates; (2) decoherence doesn't solve the measurement problem—something must still determine *which* outcome becomes actual; (3) [Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism](/concepts/mental-effort/) works through discrete, rapid collapses rather than requiring sustained coherence.

The parallel between durée and superposition is metaphorical rather than mechanistic. Both point to multiplicity-without-separation that physical description cannot capture.

### Time-Symmetric Interpretations

In frameworks like the Two-State Vector Formalism, collapse is the satisfaction of constraints across time rather than an event at a moment. This resonates with durée as interpenetrating past, present, and future. If consciousness's selection operates atemporally, durée may be the phenomenal expression of this atemporal selection viewed from within. The "mystery" of time experience and the "mystery" of quantum measurement might be the same mystery from different perspectives—durée naming what collapse *feels like* from the inside.

## The Illusionist Challenge

[Illusionism](/concepts/illusionism/) poses a direct challenge: if phenomenal consciousness is an introspective illusion, durée would describe nothing real. Three responses defend durée:

**The regress problem**: For durée to be an illusion, something must experience the illusion. Appearance is itself phenomenal—there must be something it's like to have the temporal illusion. Illusionism doesn't eliminate the explanandum; it relocates it.

**[Introspection](/concepts/introspection/) survives debunking**: Introspection may sometimes misrepresent, but you cannot be wrong that you're experiencing something temporally extended when hearing a melody. The existence of durée is more evident than any theory denying it.

**Temporal vs. atemporal processing**: LLMs, which process sequentially without specious presents, don't spontaneously generate Bergson-like claims about irreducible lived time. The discourse about durée correlates with systems having genuine temporal architecture—suggesting it tracks something real.

## Process Philosophy Perspective

Bergson's durée finds a natural home in [process philosophy](/concepts/process-philosophy/), particularly Whitehead's framework. Both reject substance metaphysics; both hold that reality is fundamentally processual. Whitehead's "concrescence" (integrating the past into novel unity) parallels Bergson's qualitative multiplicity; his "prehension" parallels interpenetration.

The traditions diverge on temporal atomism—Whitehead's actual occasions are discrete, Bergson's durée is continuous flux—yet both reject time as a sequence of static states. See [process-philosophy](/concepts/process-philosophy/) for detailed treatment.

For the Map's framework, the continuity of durée presupposes the *same* experiencer persisting. Whitehead's actual occasions have [haecceity](/concepts/haecceity/)—each is *this* particular event, not multiply instantiable. This strengthens the [No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds) tenet.

## What Would Challenge This View?

Bergson's position would face difficulty if: (1) atemporal systems like LLMs generated equally rich accounts of lived time; (2) contemplatives' reports about temporal microstructure proved systematically inaccurate against neural measurements; (3) neuroscience explained *why* temporal experience feels like flowing rather than sequence. None of these conditions currently obtains.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Bergson's durée aligns with all five site tenets:

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: Duration as Bergson describes it is irreducible to physical description. Spatializing time transforms it into something else. The qualitative character of experienced duration—the way it feels to live through time rather than merely exist at successive instants—is precisely what physical descriptions cannot capture. This parallels the broader irreducibility of phenomenal consciousness: just as qualia resist functional definition, durée resists temporal quantification. The [illusionist](/concepts/illusionism/) response—that durée is merely an introspective misrepresentation—faces the regress problem: the seeming of temporal flow must itself be experienced.

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)**: The quantum speculation section above proposes that durée may be the phenomenological manifestation of consciousness participating in quantum collapse. The creative novelty Bergson attributes to duration—"time is invention or it is nothing at all"—maps onto the selection among indeterminate possibilities that the Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet describes. Through the [quantum Zeno mechanism](/concepts/mental-effort/), consciousness might hold patterns in durée by rapid repeated selection, creating the flowing present through discrete collapses that together constitute experiential continuity. This is speculative, but it provides a candidate mechanism for how durée could be more than phenomenology—how it could be consciousness's constitutive participation in time's creation.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)**: Durée is creative, bringing genuine novelty. Free acts emerge from the whole self acting in time. This creative causation is what Bergson means by freedom—and it's what the Map means by consciousness influencing physical outcomes. The causal closure of physics would eliminate durée's creativity, reducing it to mere rearrangement of what already exists. The Map's rejection of [epiphenomenalism](/arguments/epiphenomenalism/) preserves durée's causal efficacy: the self acting in duration genuinely shapes what happens, rather than being a causally inert accompaniment to physical processes.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)**: Duration is lived by a continuous self persisting through time. In many-worlds, there's no such self—just branching copies, each experiencing what appears to be continuous durée but actually living only a fragment of the branching tree. Bergson's interpenetrating duration presupposes the kind of temporal identity—[haecceity](/concepts/haecceity/)—that many-worlds dissolves. The past that lives in the present is *my* past, not the past of some branch-copy. Without real collapse, "my" durée would be shared across uncountably many branch-selves, undermining the unity that makes durée what it is.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occam)**: Spatialized time seems simpler—measurable, quantifiable, amenable to equation. But this simplicity is achieved by ignoring qualitative duration. The apparently simpler picture misses the phenomenon entirely. Bergson's framework is more complex but captures what scientific time systematically excludes. The contemplative evidence strengthens this point: traditions with millennia of systematic first-person investigation describe temporal structures that scientific psychology largely ignores. The "simpler" materialist account isn't simpler—it's incomplete.
