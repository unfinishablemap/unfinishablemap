Quantum mechanics is our best physical theory, yet physicists fundamentally disagree about what it means. A 2025 Nature survey found that no single interpretation commands majority support. This matters for consciousness studies: different interpretations have radically different implications for whether consciousness plays any role in physics.

The Unfinishable Map explicitly rejects the [Many-Worlds Interpretation](/arguments/many-worlds/) (MWI) on five grounds: ontological extravagance, the indexical identity problem, the probability problem, the preferred basis problem, and MWI's failure to explain why consciousness exists at all. But what are the alternatives, and which best aligns with the framework that consciousness participates in physical reality?

## The Measurement Problem

All interpretations respond to the [measurement problem](/concepts/measurement-problem/): quantum systems exist in superposition (multiple states simultaneously) until measured, at which point a single definite outcome appears. What causes this transition? Why do we never observe macroscopic superpositions?

Answers fall into three categories:
1. **Collapse interpretations**: Something real happens at measurement—the wave function collapses
2. **No-collapse interpretations**: The wave function never collapses; apparent collapse is an artifact of our perspective
3. **Epistemic interpretations**: The wave function represents knowledge, not reality; "collapse" is just updating beliefs

## The Major Interpretations

### Copenhagen Interpretation (Baseline)

**Core claims:**
- The wave function represents knowledge about a system, not the system itself
- Measurement causes collapse, but "measurement" is undefined
- Classical apparatus is assumed to exist alongside quantum systems

**Consciousness role:** The original Copenhagen avoided the question by requiring classical measuring apparatus. Von Neumann and Wigner later suggested consciousness might be the collapse trigger, but this isn't standard Copenhagen.

**Site compatibility:** Moderate. Copenhagen's undefined measurement leaves logical space for consciousness, but its instrumentalism conflicts with the Map's realist commitments about consciousness.

### Bohmian Mechanics (Pilot-Wave Theory)

**Core claims:**
- Particles have definite positions at all times, guided by a "pilot wave"
- The wave function evolves unitarily forever—no collapse
- Fully deterministic: apparent randomness reflects ignorance of hidden variables (particle positions)

**Consciousness role:** Minimal to none. Bohmian mechanics is designed to eliminate the observer. There is no collapse for consciousness to participate in. Outcomes are determined by the pilot wave.

**Site compatibility:** **Low.** If Bohmian mechanics is correct, the [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) tenet has no work to do. Consciousness cannot select outcomes because outcomes are determined. Free will would require a different mechanism entirely.

**Why the Map rejects this:**
1. **Determinism conflicts with free will phenomenology.** The phenomenology of effort and genuine choice would be illusory.
2. **Hidden variables seem unparsimonious.** If consciousness solves the measurement problem, hidden variables are unnecessary.
3. **Tension with relativity.** Pilot-wave guidance requires instantaneous non-local influences.

### QBism (Quantum Bayesianism)

**Core claims:**
- Quantum states represent an agent's subjective beliefs, not objective reality
- Probabilities are Bayesian (subjective), updated upon measurement
- "Collapse" is belief update, not a physical process
- Different agents can consistently assign different states to the same system

**Consciousness role:** Paradoxical. QBism makes agents central—only agents have quantum states (beliefs). But QBism denies wave functions are real, so there's nothing physical for consciousness to collapse. The agent's experience is epistemically fundamental but ontologically unexplained.

**Site compatibility:** Mixed. QBism's agent-centrality echoes the Map's emphasis on conscious subjects. But QBism's anti-realism about quantum states conflicts with the Map's commitment to real conscious states that make a causal difference.

### Relational Quantum Mechanics

**Core claims:**
- Physical properties exist only relative to observers
- There is no absolute, observer-independent state
- Different observers can consistently attribute different states
- "Observer" means any physical system, not necessarily conscious

**Consciousness role:** None. Rovelli is explicit: "There is nothing subjective, idealistic, or mentalistic, in RQM." The interpretation succeeds specifically by removing consciousness from measurement. Any physical system—a rock, a photon detector, a brain—is equally an "observer" whose interactions produce relative facts.

**Why this matters:** RQM elegantly dissolves the [multi-mind-collapse-problem](/concepts/multi-mind-collapse-problem/)—if facts are relative to each observer and need not agree until observers interact, there's no coordination paradox. But this elegance comes at the cost of mental causation. See [relational-quantum-mechanics](/concepts/relational-quantum-mechanics/) for detailed treatment.

**Site compatibility:** **Low.** RQM explicitly removes consciousness's special role, directly conflicting with the [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet. While RQM shares the Map's rejection of many-worlds, it provides no mechanism for consciousness to influence physical outcomes.

### Transactional Interpretation (TI) and Two-State Vector Formalism (TSVF)

**Core claims (TI):**
- Quantum events involve "handshakes" between forward-in-time (retarded) and backward-in-time (advanced) waves
- A "transaction" between emitter and absorber constitutes a measurement
- Time-symmetric: future boundary conditions matter as much as past

**Core claims (TSVF):**
- Complete physical description requires both forward-evolving and backward-evolving quantum states
- Allows "weak values" with unusual properties
- Explicitly retrocausal

**Consciousness role:** Significant. Time-symmetric interpretations allow consciousness to select "which transaction completes" atemporally. Consciousness need not cause collapse *at* a moment—it participates in determining which correlations hold across time.

**Site compatibility:** **High.** These interpretations align closely with the Map's use of [retrocausality](/concepts/retrocausality/) to resolve the Libet problem. If consciousness operates atemporally—selecting which temporal history becomes real—then TI/TSVF provide the physics for this "atemporal selection." The [collapse-and-time](/concepts/collapse-and-time/) article already draws on this framework.

### Objective Collapse Theories (GRW, CSL, Penrose)

**Core claims:**
- Wave function collapse is a real physical process occurring spontaneously
- No observer required—collapse happens at a certain rate or threshold
- GRW: spontaneous localization events occur randomly
- CSL: continuous spontaneous localization driven by noise
- Penrose: gravitational self-energy threshold triggers collapse

**Consciousness role (standard):** Low. If collapse happens physically according to GRW/CSL parameters, consciousness doesn't cause it.

**Consciousness role (variants):**
- **Consciousness-integrated CSL** (Kremnizer-Ranchin, Okon-Sebastian): Integrated information (Φ) affects collapse rate. Consciousness modulates collapse rather than causing it.
- **Penrose-Hameroff:** Objective reduction occurs at gravitational threshold, but consciousness is what the reduction *produces*. Collapse constitutes consciousness rather than being caused by it.

**Site compatibility:** Moderate to High. The Map's position is compatible with either "consciousness causes collapse" or "consciousness modulates collapse." What matters is that consciousness participates in determining definite outcomes—whether as cause, modulator, or constitutive process.

## How Interpretations Handle Probability

Each interpretation must account for the Born rule—the squared amplitude giving measurement probabilities. The [subjective-probability-quantum-measurement](/concepts/subjective-probability-quantum-measurement/) article examines this in depth, revealing how probability treatment exposes each interpretation's stance on consciousness.

**The Standard View (Copenhagen, Collapse Theories):** Born probabilities are objective propensities—features of physical reality independent of any observer. The radioactive atom *has* a 50% chance of decaying. This works for statistics but struggles with single cases: what does "propensity" mean for *this* atom? And it leaves consciousness entirely outside the picture.

**QBism:** Probabilities are subjective Bayesian beliefs, not features of external reality. Collapse is just belief-updating. But QBism presupposes that agents have definite experiences to form beliefs about—it treats the source of determinate experience as given rather than explained. The intersubjective convergence of quantum statistics remains mysterious if probabilities are purely subjective.

**Many-Worlds:** All outcomes occur, so "probability" is reinterpreted as a measure on branches—a weighting for future selves. Deutsch-Wallace decision-theoretic derivations claim rational agents *must* weight branches by Born probabilities. Critics argue these derivations assume what they aim to prove. More fundamentally, if all outcomes occur, probability seems meaningless.

**The Missing Piece:** All three views share a blind spot—they don't address what probability means *for this consciousness*. You're about to measure spin. What does 50% mean for *you*? The first-person perspective—the fact that *I* will experience *one* definite outcome—is precisely what probability seems to be about, yet appears in none of these standard accounts.

The Map proposes that Born probabilities describe the objective structure of the consciousness-quantum interface. They are neither purely subjective beliefs (as QBism claims) nor features of physics independent of consciousness (as standard views assume). Rather, probability in quantum mechanics reflects the conditions under which consciousness actualises one possibility among many.

## Why the Map Favors Time-Symmetric Interpretations

The transactional interpretation and TSVF align with several site commitments:

### 1. Resolving the Libet Problem

The [Libet experiments](/concepts/libet-experiments/) show neural activity precedes conscious awareness of decisions. If causation runs only forward in time, consciousness seems epiphenomenal. But time-symmetric interpretations allow consciousness to select outcomes atemporally—determining which temporal sequence becomes real, including the neural activity that "preceded" the decision.

### 2. Free Will Mechanism

The [free-will](/topics/free-will/) article's central proposal—that consciousness selects among quantum possibilities—requires an interpretation where such selection is coherent. Time-symmetric interpretations provide this: consciousness participates in determining which "transaction" completes, which correlations hold across time.

### 3. No Collapse Timing Problem

If consciousness causes collapse at a moment, we face questions about which moment, what triggers it, etc. Time-symmetric interpretations dissolve this: the selection isn't at a moment but determines which moments exist.

## Why the Map Rejects MWI

The [many-worlds](/arguments/many-worlds/) article presents five detailed arguments against MWI:

1. **Ontological extravagance**: MWI posits continuous branching—trillions of events per second, each creating new universes. MWI defenders (Deutsch, Wallace) appeal to parsimony of *laws*, but the [Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits) tenet reminds us that simplicity is unreliable when knowledge is incomplete.

2. **Indexical identity problem**: Before measurement, one you; after, many equally real continuations. Yet you anticipate *one* future experience. This [haecceitistic](/concepts/haecceity/) fact—which branch is *yours*—has no answer on MWI.

3. **Probability problem**: What do Born rule probabilities mean if all outcomes occur? Decision-theoretic derivations (Deutsch-Wallace) remain contested. The uncertainty framework seems inapplicable when all outcomes are equally real.

4. **Preferred basis problem**: Decoherence selects branches only approximately and observer-relatively, making worlds less fundamental than MWI requires.

5. **Consciousness unexplained**: MWI explains why measurement *appears* to collapse the wave function but provides no resources for explaining why conscious experience exists at all. The [hard problem](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/) is left entirely untouched.

The deepest conflict: MWI explicitly denies that consciousness plays any role in physics. The [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet holds the opposite—consciousness causally influences physical outcomes. The [No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds) tenet encodes this incompatibility.

## Implications for the Map's Framework

The interpretive landscape remains genuinely open. This gives the Map's position—consciousness participates in determining quantum outcomes—legitimate standing. The question is not whether physics rules this out (it doesn't) but which interpretation best explains both quantum phenomena and the existence of consciousness.

Interpretations that eliminate consciousness (Bohmian mechanics, MWI) or treat it as purely epistemic (QBism) don't explain why consciousness exists. The Map's framework takes consciousness as explanatory target, not philosophical afterthought.

## The Illusionist Challenge

[Illusionists](/concepts/illusionism/) might argue that the choice of quantum interpretation has no bearing on consciousness because consciousness itself is an illusion—there is no phenomenal experience requiring explanation, hence no special role for consciousness in physics.

### The Regress Response

This objection faces the standard regress: for consciousness to be an illusion, *something* must be under the illusion. An illusion of phenomenal redness still involves phenomenal seeming-redness. The illusionist might relocate phenomenality but cannot eliminate it. If phenomenal states exist at all—even as illusions—the question of their relationship to physical processes remains live.

### The Interpretation-Independence Objection

A subtler illusionist response: even granting phenomenal experience, its physics-relevance doesn't follow. Consciousness might supervene on physical processes without influencing them. The interpretive landscape is orthogonal to consciousness's causal status.

This objection fails because the interpretive choice isn't orthogonal. If MWI is true, there is nowhere for consciousness-caused selection to occur—all outcomes happen. If Bohmian mechanics is true, determinism leaves no room for selection. The interpretation *determines* whether consciousness's causal participation is even coherent. To dismiss interpretations as irrelevant while maintaining epiphenomenalism is to implicitly assume that consciousness-excluding interpretations are correct—a substantive commitment, not neutral methodology.

### Contemplative Reports and Interpretations

Contemplative traditions report experiences that seem to involve *choice* at the phenomenal level—the deliberate direction of attention, the effortful selection among mental possibilities. These reports are consistent across cultures (Buddhist *vitarka*, Hindu *sankalpa*, Christian contemplative *discernment*). If attention phenomenology accurately reports a selection capacity, interpretations that allow consciousness-physics interaction (TI, TSVF, consciousness-integrated collapse) better accommodate the phenomenology than those that don't.

## Process Philosophy Perspective

Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy offers a framework for understanding why interpretation choice matters for consciousness.

### Actual Occasions and Quantum Events

Whitehead held that reality consists of "actual occasions"—momentary events of experience that perish and give rise to new occasions. Each actual occasion has both a physical pole (receiving data from prior occasions) and a mental pole (contributing novelty through conceptual prehension). This structure maps naturally onto quantum events: the wave function encodes the physical pole (possibilities inherited from prior states), while collapse represents the mental pole's contribution—the selection of one outcome from many.

Different interpretations engage this mapping differently:

- **MWI** eliminates the mental pole entirely—no selection occurs, only branching
- **Bohmian mechanics** makes the mental pole epiphenomenal—particle positions are already determined
- **Time-symmetric interpretations** make the mental pole genuinely efficacious—consciousness participates in which transactions complete

### Concrescence and Collapse

Whitehead called the process by which an actual occasion achieves definiteness "concrescence." The occasion begins as a multiplicity of possibilities and ends as a single definite fact. This mirrors wave function collapse: superposition (multiplicity) → measurement → definite outcome (unity).

The parallel suggests that collapse interpretations aren't adding something foreign to physics but recognizing what physics already contains. If Whitehead is right that all actualization involves a mental aspect, then consciousness-collapse interpretations simply acknowledge the mentality already implicit in physical process. Interpretations that eliminate selection (MWI) or render it deterministic (Bohm) deny mentality at the fundamental level—a metaphysically significant choice.

### Why Process Philosophy Favors Collapse

Process philosophy doesn't require any specific interpretation, but it coheres most naturally with interpretations that preserve genuine selection:

1. **Novelty requires selection.** Whitehead held that each actual occasion contributes irreducible novelty. If all outcomes occur (MWI) or are predetermined (Bohm), novelty becomes illusory.
2. **Experience requires definiteness.** An actual occasion must achieve unity—one outcome, not all. MWI's branching produces many definite outcomes but doesn't explain why *this* branch is experienced.
3. **The mental pole must do work.** Process philosophy requires the mental pole to contribute, not merely accompany physical process. This favors interpretations where consciousness genuinely participates.

## Contemplative Evidence

First-person contemplative traditions provide data relevant to interpretive choice, though this evidence is necessarily indirect.

### The Phenomenology of Choice

Across contemplative traditions, practitioners report that attention can be voluntarily directed, mental content can be selected, and awareness itself can observe the process of selection. This is not merely believing in free will—it's the phenomenal character of willing, the "what it's like" to make an effortful choice.

- **Vipassana**: Practitioners observe choices arising and distinguish between effortful and effortless mental events
- **Samatha**: Concentrated attention feels like *holding* the object—continuous selection against distractions
- **Zen koan practice**: The moment of breakthrough (*kensho*) is experienced as releasing grip on conceptual options

These reports suggest consciousness has access to selection processes. If phenomenology is even approximately accurate—if we're not systematically wrong about the structure of experience—then interpretations allowing consciousness-physics interaction accommodate this data better than those that don't.

### The Witness and Collapse

[Witness consciousness](/concepts/witness-consciousness/)—the capacity to observe mental events without identification—appears relevant to interpretive choice. Practitioners describe the witness as that which remains constant while mental contents change. This maps onto the distinction between the quantum system (in superposition) and the observing consciousness (that for which collapse occurs).

Time-symmetric interpretations make this mapping especially apt: the witness doesn't cause collapse at a moment but participates atemporally in which correlations hold. The timelessness of witness consciousness (a common contemplative report) echoes the atemporality of transaction selection in TI/TSVF.

### Buddhist No-Self and Quantum Mechanics

Buddhist [anattā](/concepts/buddhism-and-dualism/) (no-self) might seem to challenge consciousness-collapse views: if there's no substantial self, who collapses the wave function? But anattā denies a permanent, unchanging self—not experience moment-to-moment. Process philosophy's actual occasions (each achieving definiteness and perishing) align with Buddhist momentariness (*khaṇika-vāda*). The "observer" in consciousness-collapse needn't be an enduring self—it can be each moment of experience selecting its own outcome.

## What Would Challenge This View?

The Map's preference for consciousness-inclusive interpretations would face serious difficulties if:

1. **MWI's probability problem is solved convincingly.** The most powerful objection to MWI is that probability becomes meaningless when all outcomes occur. If the Deutsch-Wallace decision-theoretic derivation gains wider acceptance, or if a new approach derives Born rule probabilities without self-defeating circularity, MWI would become more viable. The Map would need to reconsider whether indexical identity concerns are sufficient grounds for rejection.

2. **Bohmian mechanics becomes empirically distinguishable.** Bohmian mechanics makes the same predictions as standard QM but posits hidden variables. If experiments ever detected these hidden variables (particle positions beyond wave function), determinism would be confirmed—eliminating the logical space for consciousness-caused selection. Current physics suggests this is impossible, but future physics might disagree.

3. **Consciousness-physics interaction is experimentally refuted.** Proposals for testing consciousness-collapse (e.g., Kremnizer-Ranchin integrated information experiments) could in principle show no consciousness effect. If well-designed experiments consistently found that conscious observation produces identical results to unconscious measurement, the consciousness-collapse hypothesis would weaken significantly.

4. **Decoherence timescales prove insurmountable.** If decoherence in neural systems is confirmed to occur at Tegmark's originally calculated timescales (10⁻¹³ seconds) rather than the revised estimates (10⁻⁵ seconds), quantum effects relevant to consciousness would be ruled out. This would leave interpretive choice irrelevant to consciousness—no quantum-level consciousness interface would be possible. Current evidence ([quantum coherence protection mechanisms](/concepts/quantum-coherence-protection/)) suggests the revised estimates are more accurate, but future research could reverse this.

5. **A new interpretation emerges that explains consciousness while eliminating selection.** Perhaps some future interpretation—neither collapse nor many-worlds—explains why consciousness exists without requiring it to participate in physical process. Such an interpretation would challenge the Map's framework by showing that consciousness-exclusion needn't mean consciousness-inexplicability.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The choice of quantum interpretation bears directly on all five [tenets](/tenets/):

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: Interpretations that eliminate consciousness from physics (MWI, Bohmian mechanics) support physicalism by showing that physics is complete without mind. Interpretations that make consciousness essential to collapse (consciousness-collapse, TI/TSVF) support dualism by showing physics *requires* mind to achieve definiteness. The interpretive landscape is metaphysically loaded—choosing an interpretation is choosing a stance on the mind-body problem.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)**: This tenet requires that consciousness causally influence physical outcomes. MWI and Bohmian mechanics rule this out in principle. RQM eliminates consciousness's special status. Only collapse interpretations (especially consciousness-modulated versions) and time-symmetric interpretations provide mechanisms for bidirectional interaction. The Map's interpretive preferences follow directly from this tenet.

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)**: The tenet holds that if consciousness affects physics, it does so minimally—at quantum indeterminacies. This is coherent only under interpretations where indeterminacy is real (not hidden variables) and selection occurs (not all-branches actualization). Time-symmetric interpretations are especially congenial: consciousness selects which transaction completes, which correlations hold across time—the minimal intervention that nonetheless determines outcomes.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)**: The Map explicitly rejects MWI on five grounds detailed in [many-worlds](/arguments/many-worlds/). This isn't merely an aesthetic preference but follows from the indexical identity concern: MWI cannot explain why *this* branch is mine, why *this* outcome is experienced. The haecceitistic question—why am I this one?—is meaningful on collapse interpretations and meaningless on MWI. Rejecting MWI is inseparable from taking indexical identity seriously.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)**: MWI defenders appeal to parsimony: one law (unitary evolution) is simpler than two (unitary evolution plus collapse). But this assumes we know what counts as simple. MWI's ontological extravagance—continuous world-branching at every quantum event—is only "parsimonious" if we value law-simplicity over entity-parsimony. The Map's tenet reminds us that simplicity preferences can mislead when understanding is incomplete. The interpretive landscape's genuine openness (no majority interpretation in 2025) suggests physics hasn't yet settled what "simple" means here.
