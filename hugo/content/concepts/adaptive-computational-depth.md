Adaptive computational depth is the idea that reality need not maintain maximum detail everywhere simultaneously. Like adaptive mesh refinement in scientific computing, detail concentrates where it matters—and what makes it matter is conscious observation. The concept draws on simulation hypothesis literature, quantum mechanics' observer-dependent features, and information-theoretic physics. Examined carefully, adaptive computational depth initially seems to support a computational view of reality but actually points toward non-computable consciousness: the very thing driving the allocation of detail cannot itself be computed.

## The Concept

In computational physics, adaptive mesh refinement allocates processing power to regions of interest—turbulent boundaries get fine grids while calm regions stay coarse. Video games use level-of-detail rendering: distant mountains are simple polygons, but the rock in front of you has visible grain. The principle is the same: compute in detail only where the detail will be encountered.

Adaptive computational depth applies this logic to reality itself. If the universe has finite informational or computational resources, it need not determine every quantum state in advance. States that no observer will inspect can remain indeterminate—not hidden, but genuinely undecided. Detail crystallises where consciousness directs attention.

This is not merely a metaphor borrowed from computing. On interpretations where measurement produces definite outcomes from indeterminate superpositions—Copenhagen, objective collapse, consciousness-based—quantum mechanics already exhibits this structure. Properties remain indeterminate until something resolves them. The [measurement problem](/concepts/measurement-problem/)—why and how this resolution occurs—remains unsolved. Adaptive computational depth names a pattern that several interpretations of physics already display but cannot fully account for.

## Sources of the Idea

Several independent intellectual traditions converge on adaptive computational depth without using the term.

**Wheeler's "it from bit."** John Archibald Wheeler proposed in 1989 that "every item of the physical world has at bottom—at a very deep bottom, in most instances—an immaterial source and explanation" (Wheeler 1990). His participatory universe holds that observation does not merely reveal reality but participates in constituting it. Unobserved regions lack full determination—not because information is hidden, but because the physical facts have not yet been generated. This is adaptive depth avant la lettre: the universe's informational content increases where observers engage with it.

**Bostrom's simulation argument.** Bostrom (2003) noted that a simulated universe need not compute quantum-level detail everywhere. Advanced simulations would use "powerful computational shortcuts" operating "at a much higher level of abstraction." While Bostrom's argument assumes consciousness is computable—a premise The Unfinishable Map rejects—his observation about selective detail allocation is structurally sound regardless of what drives the selection.

**Wolfram's computational irreducibility.** Stephen Wolfram (2002) demonstrated that certain computational processes cannot be simplified; the only way to determine their outcome is to run every step. This means a system exhibiting adaptive depth cannot simply preview which regions will need detail—it must make real-time allocation decisions. The Map draws an inference: if the allocator must respond to irreducibly complex, unfolding conditions rather than following a pre-computed plan, this favours something capable of contextual judgment over pre-programmed optimisation. Computationalists would resist this inference—reactive algorithms can respond to unfolding conditions without non-computational elements—but the Map holds that genuine contextual judgment (determining what *matters*) differs from algorithmic reaction.

**Irwin et al.'s self-simulation.** The self-simulation hypothesis (Irwin, Amaral, and Chester 2020) proposes a "Principle of Efficient Language": consciousness generates maximum meaning using minimal computational resources. This is the most explicit formulation of adaptive depth in the literature, though embedded in a panconsciousness framework closer to idealism than the Map's interactionist dualism.

## The Non-Computability Turn

Here is where adaptive computational depth becomes philosophically interesting rather than merely suggestive.

If consciousness drives computational allocation—deciding where reality resolves into detail—then the allocator must stand outside the computation it directs. The obvious objection: computational systems routinely allocate their own resources. Operating systems manage memory, video games run LOD systems as part of their own code, neural networks adjust attention weights. Why can't a computational universe allocate its own depth?

The difference is between *what to compute* and *what matters*. A video game's LOD system follows pre-specified rules: render in detail near the camera. The "camera" is defined computationally. But in the adaptive-depth framework, what triggers higher resolution is conscious observation—and defining consciousness computationally recreates the problem. A subroutine that determines "where consciousness is attending" must either reduce consciousness to a computable predicate (begging the question against non-computability) or appeal to something outside the computation. This creates a regress: whatever process allocates computational depth must itself be computed at some level, requiring its own allocator, and so on—unless the allocator is non-computational.

Roger Penrose's argument that consciousness involves non-computable processes (Penrose 1994) resolves this regress. If conscious observation is what collapses indeterminacy into definite outcomes, and this process is non-algorithmic, then adaptive computational depth is a real feature of reality that no simulation could reproduce. The adaptivity is genuine—physics really does resolve into definite states where consciousness attends—but the mechanism is not computation. It is non-computable consciousness acting on [quantum indeterminacy](/concepts/quantum-consciousness/).

Faizal et al. (2025) reach a compatible conclusion from a different direction, arguing via Gödel's incompleteness theorem that "a fully consistent and complete description of reality cannot be achieved through computation alone." These results belong to a broader family of [proven computational limits](/voids/computational-cognitive-limits/)—Gödel, Turing, Chaitin—that no algorithmic process can circumvent. Whether or not Faizal's specific proof withstands scrutiny, the general point reinforces the non-computability turn: adaptive depth is real, but its engine is not a computer.

## The Prebiotic Question

If consciousness drives where detail concentrates, what determined outcomes before conscious observers existed? Stars formed and chemistry proceeded for billions of years without minds attending to the process.

The Map's resolution applies here as it does to the broader [prebiotic collapse problem](/concepts/prebiotic-collapse/): objective physical mechanisms (gravitational collapse, spontaneous localisation, or unknown processes) provide baseline state reduction throughout the universe. Consciousness modulates this process locally in neural systems, increasing the depth of determination where minds engage. Before observers, reality operated at its baseline resolution—fully physical, fully real, but without the additional determination that conscious attention introduces. Adaptive computational depth is a modulation of an already-functional physical process, not its sole source.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Adaptive computational depth aligns with each of the Map's [tenets](/tenets/) in specific ways.

**Dualism.** The concept's internal logic leads to non-computable consciousness. If the allocator of computational depth were itself computable, it would need its own allocator—an infinite regress. The natural termination point is a non-computational, non-physical consciousness that directs where indeterminacy resolves. This supports the Map's commitment that consciousness is not reducible to physical processes.

**Minimal quantum interaction.** Adaptive depth describes consciousness influencing which quantum states become determinate—biasing otherwise indeterminate outcomes without injecting energy. The "resolution increase" at points of observation is precisely the minimal intervention the Map's second tenet describes: selecting among possibilities that physics leaves open.

**Bidirectional interaction.** The entire framework depends on consciousness causally influencing physical outcomes. Consciousness is not passively observing a pre-rendered reality; it participates in determining which physical facts become actual. This mirrors [consciousness selecting neural patterns](/concepts/consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns/)—the brain presents quantum-level options, and consciousness determines which become real.

**No Many Worlds.** Under many-worlds, all quantum outcomes occur in separate branches, and there is nothing to allocate—every possibility is realised. Adaptive computational depth is incoherent under many-worlds because the concept requires selective realisation. Only interpretations where measurement produces single definite outcomes leave room for an allocator of detail.

**Occam's Razor has limits.** The computationalist version of adaptive depth—reality as a simulation optimising resources—is appealingly simple. But this simplicity collapses under examination: it assumes computable consciousness, generates infinite regress in the allocation mechanism, and conflicts with Godelian limits on computation. The more complex account—non-computable consciousness modulating quantum indeterminacy—is what the evidence actually supports.

## Epistemological Status

Adaptive computational depth as a framework for dualism inherits the unfalsifiability that characterises consciousness-based interpretations of quantum mechanics. As the [measurement problem](/concepts/measurement-problem/) article acknowledges, consciousness-selection within Born probabilities is empirically indistinguishable from random collapse. The value here is conceptual rather than predictive: adaptive depth connects the observer-dependence of quantum mechanics with the Map's commitment to non-computable consciousness. This is a philosophical framework compatible with physics, not a competing physical hypothesis.

The [bandwidth constraint](/concepts/consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns/) on conscious processing (~10 bits/second) is relevant. If consciousness allocates computational depth, it does so at policy level—selecting *domains* of attention, not micromanaging individual quantum events. Every such selection is an [allocation of a severely constrained resource](/concepts/attentional-economics/). This aligns with the Map's broader model: consciousness operates as a coarse-grained selector, and the physical mechanisms handle the details within the selected domain. See [consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns](/concepts/consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns/) for how this bandwidth constraint shapes the Map's account of [Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism](/concepts/stapp-quantum-mind/).

## What Would Challenge This View?

The adaptive-computational-depth framework would face serious difficulty if:

1. **The measurement problem dissolves.** If decoherence or another physical process fully explains why measurements yield definite outcomes—leaving no residual role for an observer—the "adaptive" aspect loses its motivation. Currently, decoherence explains basis selection but not outcome selection.

2. **Consciousness proves computable.** If functionalism is vindicated—consciousness successfully replicated in silicon—the regress argument collapses. The allocator could be computational after all, and adaptive depth would support computationalism rather than dualism.

3. **Many-worlds proves empirically superior.** If MWI made novel confirmed predictions that collapse theories could not match, adaptive depth would be incoherent—there is nothing to allocate when all outcomes are realised.

4. **The self-allocation objection proves decisive.** If a convincing account demonstrates that computational systems can determine "what matters" without any non-computational input—that relevance itself is computable—the regress argument's key premise fails.

5. **Quantum indeterminacy proves apparent.** If superdeterminism or hidden variables are vindicated, the gap where consciousness supposedly operates closes entirely.
