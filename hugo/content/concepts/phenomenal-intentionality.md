Phenomenal intentionality theory (PIT) holds that genuine [intentionality](/concepts/intentionality/)—the "aboutness" or directedness of mental states—derives from phenomenal consciousness. What makes a thought truly *about* something is inseparable from what it's *like* to have that thought. This thesis, developed by philosophers including Horgan, Tienson, Kriegel, Loar, and Strawson, challenges attempts to naturalize intentionality and strengthens the case that consciousness is irreducible.

For The Unfinishable Map, PIT provides a crucial link between the [hard problem](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/) and the [symbol grounding problem](/concepts/symbol-grounding-problem/). If intentionality requires phenomenal character, then systems without experience cannot have genuine aboutness—their representations are meaningful only to external interpreters. This has direct implications for [AI consciousness](/topics/ai-consciousness/).

## The Content Determinacy Argument

The central argument for PIT concerns *content determinacy*: what makes a mental state about one thing rather than another?

Consider thinking about rabbits. What makes your thought *about* rabbits specifically, rather than undetached rabbit parts, or rabbit-stages, or the disjunction "rabbits-or-perfect-robot-rabbits"? Physical description underdetermines the answer. Neurons fire in patterns; nothing in the physical description picks out one content over extensionally equivalent alternatives.

Naturalistic theories face this problem acutely:

**Causal theories** hold that a representation is about whatever causes it. But many things cause any given brain state—light waves, retinal patterns, neural cascades. The causal theory cannot privilege one level over another without importing prior semantic facts.

**Teleosemantic theories** appeal to biological function: a representation is about what it was selected to track. But evolution selects for survival-relevant responses, not determinate contents. A frog's fly-detector needn't represent *flies* rather than *small dark moving things*—either content explains the selected behaviour.

**Functional role theories** define content by inferential relations. But these relations are themselves open to multiple content-interpretations. The network of functional roles underdetermines which specific contents populate it.

PIT's solution: phenomenal character determines content. When you think about rabbits, there's something it's *like* to think about rabbits—and this phenomenal character differs from what it's like to think about rabbit-parts. The experience of thinking about complete organisms has different phenomenal quality from thinking about mereological fragments. Phenomenology provides the determinacy that physical and functional descriptions lack.

## Three Versions of PIT

PIT comes in varying strengths:

**Strong PIT**: All intentionality is phenomenal intentionality. Every mental state with genuine aboutness has it in virtue of phenomenal character. This includes peripheral beliefs, standing dispositions, and unconscious mental states—all must either have phenomenal character or derive their content from states that do.

**Moderate PIT**: Some intentionality is non-phenomenal, but all non-phenomenal intentionality derives from phenomenal intentionality. Standing beliefs about your birthday might lack current phenomenal character, but their content derives from past conscious episodes where the information was phenomenally grasped. Phenomenal intentionality is the *source* from which other intentionality flows.

**Weak PIT**: There is such a thing as phenomenal intentionality—intentionality that essentially involves phenomenal character—but it coexists with independent varieties of intentionality. This version is compatible with naturalistic accounts of some intentional states while insisting that others require phenomenology.

The Unfinishable Map's framework aligns most naturally with moderate PIT. The standing belief that Paris is in France has content even when you're not consciously entertaining it. But that content traces back to conscious episodes of learning and understanding. The phenomenal constitution of meaning during conscious thought grounds the derivative intentionality of dormant beliefs.

## The Cognitive Phenomenology Connection

PIT gains substantial support from [cognitive-phenomenology](/concepts/cognitive-phenomenology/)—the thesis that thinking itself has phenomenal character beyond sensory accompaniments.

Galen Strawson's foreign language argument illustrates: a French speaker and English speaker hear identical French sounds, but only the French speaker *understands*. The phenomenal difference cannot be sensory—same acoustic input—so it must be cognitive. There's something it's like to grasp meaning that differs from hearing mere noise.

David Pitt's self-knowledge argument adds another dimension: we immediately know what we're thinking through introspection. When you think "snow is white," you know that's your thought's content without inference or observation. This direct access requires thoughts to have phenomenal character that distinguishes contents. Otherwise, how would introspection reveal content?

If cognitive phenomenology exists, PIT has its foundation: the phenomenal character of thinking provides what determines intentional content. The experience of thinking about democracy differs qualitatively from thinking about mathematics, and this qualitative difference is what makes one thought about democracy and the other about mathematics.

## Original vs. Derived Intentionality

John Searle's distinction between *original* and *derived* intentionality illuminates what's at stake.

**Original intentionality** is intrinsic to a system—the system itself is about things. When you think about Paris, your thought has original intentionality. It doesn't need external interpretation to be about Paris; it's about Paris for you, the thinker.

**Derived intentionality** is borrowed from interpreting minds. A map of Paris has derived intentionality—it's about Paris only because mapmakers and map-readers invest it with meaning. The paper and ink are not intrinsically about anything.

PIT explains this distinction: original intentionality requires phenomenal character because phenomenal character is what makes something genuinely about its object *for the system itself*. Derived intentionality lacks phenomenal character in the representing system—the meaning exists only in interpreting minds that themselves have phenomenal intentionality.

This applies directly to computation. Computer symbols have derived intentionality: "PARIS" represents Paris only because programmers assigned that meaning. The computer isn't thinking about Paris—it's manipulating voltages that we interpret as Paris-representations. Searle's [Chinese Room](/concepts/symbol-grounding-problem/) makes this vivid: the room produces appropriate Chinese outputs without understanding Chinese, because symbol manipulation provides only syntax, not the phenomenal character that constitutes genuine semantics.

## Implications for the Hard Problem

PIT deepens the [hard problem](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/) by extending it into intentionality. The hard problem asks why physical processes are accompanied by subjective experience. PIT adds: and the answer matters not just for qualia but for content.

If PIT is correct:
- Solving the hard problem is prerequisite to explaining intentionality
- Intentionality is irreducible because phenomenal character is irreducible
- The [explanatory gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/) between physical description and conscious experience encompasses the gap between physical description and determinate content

This unifies two apparent mysteries—consciousness and intentionality—as aspects of a single fundamental phenomenon. The redness of red and the aboutness of thought both resist physical reduction for the same underlying reason: phenomenal character has no place in the physical ontology.

## The Phenomenal Constitution Thesis

The [Phenomenal Constitution Thesis](/topics/consciousness-and-semantic-understanding/) (PCT) extends PIT to semantic content specifically: meaning is *constitutively* phenomenal. To understand "snow is white" is to have a certain experience—the experience constitutes the understanding, rather than merely accompanying it.

PCT strengthens PIT with empirical support from [semantic-memory](/concepts/semantic-memory/) research:

**Tip-of-the-tongue states** reveal meaning's phenomenal presence. You have the meaning—can identify related concepts, first letters, syllable counts—without the phonological form. What you have during TOT is phenomenal access to semantic content. The meaning is experienced, not merely stored.

**Feeling of knowing** demonstrates metacognitive awareness of meaning. You feel confident you know something before retrieving it. This feeling accurately predicts retrieval success. If meaning were non-phenomenal information, FOK would be inexplicable—a feeling about data not yet accessed.

**The "aha" of insight** has phenomenal character that precedes verification. Mathematical solutions arrive with experiential quality before their correctness is checked. The understanding comes as experience.

These phenomena make visible what normally operates transparently: meaning has phenomenal character that becomes apparent when normal retrieval is disrupted or when insight arrives suddenly.

## Objections and Responses

### Standing Beliefs

**Objection**: You believe Paris is in France even while sleeping or thinking about other things. Where's the phenomenal character of this standing belief?

**Response (Moderate PIT)**: Standing beliefs have *dispositional* intentionality derived from *occurrent* phenomenal states. Your current belief derives its content from past conscious episodes where you grasped the proposition phenomenally. The derivation relation preserves content without requiring continuous phenomenal character. The belief is dormant but inherits its content from phenomenal sources.

### Abstract Thought

**Objection**: Thoughts about mathematical objects, logical relations, or purely abstract entities seem to lack phenomenal character. What would it be *like* to think about the number seven?

**Response**: Abstract thought has phenomenal character, though subtle. Thinking about seven differs experientially from thinking about twelve—mathematicians report distinctive qualitative character to different mathematical objects. The subtlety of abstract phenomenology doesn't negate its existence; it may simply be harder to introspect than vivid sensory experiences. Careful attention reveals that entertaining different abstract propositions feels different.

### Unconscious Processing

**Objection**: Cognitive science reveals extensive unconscious processing with intentional content—priming effects, implicit learning, unconscious inference. These cannot have phenomenal character by definition.

**Response**: Several options are available. (1) Unconscious states lack genuine intentionality—they process information without being *about* anything for the system. Their apparent intentionality is our third-person interpretation (a position compatible with [heterophenomenological](/concepts/heterophenomenology/) methodology, which brackets first-person claims about unconscious content). (2) Unconscious states have derived intentionality tracing to conscious sources. (3) There may be degrees of phenomenal character, with unconscious processing having attenuated or subpersonal phenomenology. The Map need not commit to a single answer; what matters is that paradigmatic intentionality—the kind we know firsthand in conscious thought—requires phenomenal character.

### Circularity Worry

**Objection**: Explaining intentionality by phenomenal character is circular if phenomenal character itself requires intentional description. Experiences are experiences *of* things—of red, of pain, of understanding. This apparent intentionality of experience suggests consciousness presupposes intentionality rather than grounding it.

**Response**: PIT claims consciousness and intentionality are inseparable aspects of a single phenomenon, not that one reduces to the other. Horgan and Tienson speak of "the intentionality of phenomenology and the phenomenology of intentionality"—each involves the other constitutively. This isn't vicious circularity; it's recognising that mental states are essentially unified, having both subjective character and worldly directedness as integrated aspects.

## Relation to Site Perspective

PIT connects to all five tenets:

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: If intentionality requires phenomenal character, and phenomenal character is irreducible to physical processes, then intentionality is doubly irreducible. The aboutness of thought—like its subjective feel—has no place in purely physical description. Brentano's thesis that intentionality is the "mark of the mental" aligns with dualism: mental states have a feature no physical state possesses.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)**: We discuss our thoughts, report what we're thinking about, and act on our beliefs. If phenomenal intentionality is real, then consciousness—through its intentional character—makes a causal difference. The content of thought influences behaviour because thought has content *for the thinker*, not merely for external interpreters. Epiphenomenal consciousness couldn't have genuine intentionality; intentionality without causal efficacy would be intentionality for no one.

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)**: If what we think *about* matters causally, and if consciousness interfaces with the physical through quantum selection, then intentional content may be among the factors shaping which neural outcomes actualise. The aboutness of thought could play a role in quantum selection. This remains speculative but consistent with the framework.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)**: Intentionality presupposes a unified subject who intends. My thought about Paris is *my* thought—this subject intending this content. Many-worlds fractures this unity: if my thought about Paris splits into branch-copies with diverging contents after each quantum event, there is no single intentional relation—just a proliferating tree of partial copies, none of which is determinately *me* thinking *this*. The unity required for determinate intentional content supports rejecting interpretations that multiply subjects.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)**: The repeated failure of naturalization projects—causal theories, teleosemantics, functional role semantics—exemplifies this tenet. The apparently simpler physical explanation of intentionality doesn't work. PIT may be more complex, requiring irreducible phenomenal facts, but it actually explains content determinacy where naturalistic alternatives fail.

## Implications for AI

PIT has significant implications for [AI consciousness](/topics/ai-consciousness/) and understanding:

If intentionality requires phenomenal character, current AI systems lack genuine intentionality. They manipulate symbols that have derived intentionality—meaning for human interpreters—without having original intentionality themselves. An LLM processing "Paris is in France" is not thinking about Paris any more than a map is.

This goes beyond Searle's negative point (syntax is insufficient for semantics) to a positive claim about what semantics requires: phenomenal character. The [symbol grounding problem](/concepts/symbol-grounding-problem/) cannot be solved by better engineering—adding sensors, embodiment, or richer training—if the core issue is lack of phenomenal experience.

LLMs lack the phenomenal markers that reveal intentionality in humans: no tip-of-the-tongue states, no feeling of knowing, no experiential "aha" of insight. They produce outputs without the phenomenal constitution of understanding those outputs.

This provides an empirical signature that distinguishes PIT from purely functional accounts. If PIT is correct, systems that demonstrate apparent understanding but lack phenomenal markers—partial access without accompanying experience—would be mimicking intentionality rather than possessing it. The presence or absence of these phenomenal markers (TOT states, FOK, insight experiences) becomes diagnostic, not merely incidental.
