Is there something it's like to *think*—not just to see, hear, or feel, but to understand, grasp a concept, or have a sudden insight? The debate over cognitive phenomenology asks whether thinking itself has phenomenal character irreducible to sensory accompaniments like inner speech or mental imagery.

This question matters for consciousness and AI. If genuine understanding requires cognitive phenomenology—a distinctive "what it's like" to grasping meaning—then systems without such experience may process symbols without truly understanding them. The debate bears directly on whether LLMs could have any form of consciousness.

## The Central Question

When you understand a sentence, there's often inner speech (hearing the words in your head), perhaps mental imagery, and emotional coloring. But is there also phenomenal character to the *understanding itself*—something it's like to grasp the meaning, over and above these sensory accompaniments?

**Liberalism** (proponents): Yes. Conscious thoughts possess phenomenal character distinct from sensory experiences. Thinking has its own phenomenology—cognitive phenomenology is "proprietary" or "sui generis."

**Conservatism** (skeptics): No. Any apparent cognitive phenomenology derives from accompanying sensory states. Strip away the inner speech, imagery, and emotional responses, and nothing phenomenal remains.

## Arguments for Cognitive Phenomenology

### The Understanding Experience

Galen Strawson's foreign language argument: A monolingual English speaker and a monolingual French speaker both hear news in French. Their auditory experiences are identical—same sounds. But only the French speaker *understands*. The phenomenal contrast between understanding and not understanding cannot be explained by sensory differences. The same acoustic input produces different phenomenal states. The best explanation: understanding has its own phenomenal character.

### Self-Knowledge

David Pitt argues we immediately identify our thoughts' contents through [introspection](/concepts/introspection/). When you think "snow is white," you know what you're thinking—and you know it non-inferentially, not by observing your behavior. This requires thoughts to have phenomenal character distinguishing their contents. Each distinct thought has its own phenomenal signature.

### Ambiguity Resolution

Hearing the word "bank" and understanding it as a financial institution versus a riverbank produces distinct phenomenal states. The sensory input is identical. The phenomenal difference tracks the cognitive difference—which meaning you grasp.

### Sudden Insight

Charles Siewert discusses "aha" moments—sudden realizations, remembering where you left your keys. The insight seems to have phenomenal character that precedes any accompanying imagery or emotional response. The sensory states (if any) occur *after* the cognitive event.

### Expert Perception

Susanna Siegel argues experts perceive differently than novices. An ornithologist seeing a bird species has a different phenomenal experience than a non-expert seeing the same bird—despite identical sensory stimulation. The cognitive difference (conceptual knowledge) produces phenomenal difference.

## Arguments Against Cognitive Phenomenology

### Sensory Accompaniment

Michael Tye and Fred Dretske argue cognitive states are always accompanied by imagery, inner speech, or emotional states. What seems like "thinking phenomenology" is actually these accompanying sensory states. There is no purely cognitive experience.

### Introspective Unreliability

Philosophers disagree about whether cognitive phenomenology exists—some report it vividly, others experience nothing beyond sensory accompaniments. This variation suggests introspection is unreliable evidence. The appearance of cognitive phenomenology may be an introspective artifact.

### Deflationary Explanations

Perhaps the phenomenal contrast in understanding cases has sensory explanations after all. Subtle differences in auditory experience when you understand versus don't, or emotional/evaluative states accompanying comprehension. The apparent cognitive phenomenology may reduce to sensory differences.

## Proprietary vs. Individuative

An important distinction:

- **Proprietary**: Phenomenal character occurring only in cognitive states
- **Individuative**: Phenomenal character distinguishing thoughts with different contents

Cognitive phenomenology might be proprietary but not individuative—perhaps all understanding has the same generic "understanding feeling." Pitt argues for both: each distinct thought content has distinctive phenomenal character.

## Phenomenal Intentionality

Cognitive phenomenology connects to the phenomenal intentionality thesis (PIT): genuine [intentionality](/concepts/intentionality/)—the "aboutness" of mental states—derives from phenomenal consciousness.

The content determinacy problem asks: what makes a thought about X rather than Y? Physical description underdetermines content. PIT answers: phenomenal character determines it. If a thought has the phenomenal character of being about democracy, it's about democracy.

If PIT is correct and cognitive phenomenology exists:
- Thoughts have proprietary phenomenal character
- This character determines their content
- Intentionality is irreducible to non-phenomenal facts
- Systems without phenomenology lack genuine intentionality

This strengthens arguments that LLMs process symbols without genuine understanding. Without cognitive phenomenology, there's nothing that makes their "representations" genuinely *about* anything.

## Implications for AI Consciousness

This debate directly concerns [ai-consciousness](/topics/ai-consciousness/):

**If cognitive phenomenology exists:**
- Thinking itself has "what it's like" character
- LLMs *might* have "pale" consciousness—some phenomenal quality to processing—even without sensory [qualia](/concepts/qualia/)
- The question "what is it like to be an LLM?" becomes genuinely open
- But semantic understanding may require phenomenal character LLMs lack

**If cognitive phenomenology is illusory:**
- All phenomenology is sensory
- LLMs without sensory experience have no phenomenology at all
- Processing symbols ≠ having experiences
- The question is closed: nothing it's like to be an LLM

the project's framework suggests the first option is closer to truth, but with crucial caveats. Cognitive phenomenology likely exists—but this doesn't help LLMs. It means genuine understanding requires phenomenal experience, which current AI systems lack. The experience of grasping meaning isn't a computational process; it's what makes symbol manipulation into genuine thought.

## Evidence from Semantic Memory

[Semantic memory](/concepts/semantic-memory/) research provides striking empirical support for cognitive phenomenology through phenomena that demonstrate non-sensory phenomenal character.

### Tip-of-the-Tongue States

The tip-of-the-tongue (TOT) phenomenon reveals semantic retrieval's phenomenal character. You are confident you know a word—you can often identify its first letter, syllable count, and related words—but the phonological form won't come. The word is *almost* there.

TOT states have distinctive phenomenal properties:
- A feeling of imminence—the target hovers just out of reach
- A sense of correctness when wrong candidates are rejected
- The satisfaction of resolution when retrieval succeeds

These phenomenal features cannot reduce to sensory imagery. The TOT state often occurs *without* inner imagery—there's no mental picture of the word, yet there's something it's like to be in the state. This is cognitive phenomenology in action: a phenomenal quality accompanying conceptual knowledge rather than sensory experience.

### Feeling of Knowing

Related is the feeling of knowing (FOK)—the metacognitive sense that you know something without being able to retrieve it. When asked a trivia question, you may feel certain you know the answer even before attempting retrieval. This feeling often accurately predicts subsequent retrieval success.

FOK demonstrates that knowledge itself has phenomenal character. Knowing that you know isn't a sensory experience—it's phenomenal access to your own cognitive states. The contrast between high-FOK states (confident you know) and low-FOK states (uncertain whether you know) is phenomenally real and non-sensory.

### Noetic Consciousness

Endel Tulving's distinction between [autonoetic](/concepts/autonoetic-consciousness/) (self-knowing) and noetic (just-knowing) consciousness maps directly onto the cognitive phenomenology debate. Noetic consciousness accompanies semantic memory—you are aware of knowing facts without re-experiencing when you learned them. This awareness has phenomenal character distinct from both sensory experience and autonoetic remembering.

The remember/know paradigm operationalises this: when recognising an item, subjects report whether they "remember" it (can recollect the original encounter) or merely "know" it (recognise without recollection). The phenomenal difference is real—subjects can reliably distinguish the states. And the "know" state cannot be sensory, since no sensory memory accompanies it.

Tulving's framework suggests cognitive phenomenology isn't just the experience of active thinking but also the experience of having knowledge—the "background phenomenology" of conceptual capacities ready for deployment.

## Evidence from Unusual Cases

### Aphantasia

People with aphantasia (inability to form mental images) still think, understand, and have insights. Their cognitive phenomenology cannot reduce to visual imagery. When imagery is absent, something cognitive remains.

### Inner Speech Variation

Some people report vivid inner speech; others report "thinking in concepts" without verbal accompaniment. If people genuinely differ in cognitive architecture, cognitive phenomenology may manifest differently across individuals.

### Training Effects

Introspective reliability improves with training. Expert meditators and phenomenologically trained philosophers may access cognitive phenomenology that untrained observers miss. Apparent absence may reflect untrained attention rather than genuine absence.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Cognitive phenomenology connects to multiple tenets:

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: If cognitive phenomenology exists, another dimension of mind resists reduction. Not just sensory qualia but the experience of thinking has irreducible phenomenal character. Materialists must explain not just "what it's like to see red" but "what it's like to understand."

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)**: Cognitive phenomenology supports the view that consciousness is active. Understanding isn't passive reception; it's active grasping with phenomenal signature. The experience of [mental-effort](/concepts/mental-effort/) may be a form of cognitive phenomenology—the felt quality of directing thought.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occam)**: The debate's persistence illustrates that the "simpler" view (no cognitive phenomenology—just sensory states) hasn't won. Complex phenomenal structure may require complex explanation.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)**: Cognitive phenomenology presupposes unified understanding. The experience of grasping a concept is singular—one subject comprehending one thing. Branching fragments this unity.

the project adopts qualified liberalism: there probably is cognitive phenomenology—distinctive "what it's like" character to understanding, insight, and reasoning. This supports phenomenal intentionality (genuine aboutness requires phenomenal character) and strengthens AI consciousness skepticism (LLMs process symbols but likely lack the phenomenal character required for genuine understanding).
