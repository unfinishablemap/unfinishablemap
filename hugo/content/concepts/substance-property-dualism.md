Dualism comes in two main varieties: substance dualism and property dualism. The first holds that mind and body are different *kinds of thing*—distinct substances. The second holds that mental properties are genuinely different from physical properties, without positing separate substances. Both reject [materialism's](/arguments/materialism/) claim that everything is ultimately physical, but they disagree about the underlying metaphysical structure.

This site's [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism) tenet is compatible with either formulation. What matters philosophically is that consciousness is irreducible to physics and that mental properties are genuinely novel—not the precise ontological framework that grounds this irreducibility.

## Substance Dualism

### The Cartesian View

René Descartes argued that mind (res cogitans) and body (res extensa) are entirely different kinds of substance. The body is extended in space, divisible, and operates mechanically. The mind is unextended, indivisible, and has the capacity for thought. I can imagine myself existing without my body, Descartes reasoned, but I cannot imagine myself existing without my mind. Therefore mind and body are separable in principle.

Substance dualism makes consciousness fundamentally different from physical reality—not just in how it appears to us, but in its basic nature. Minds are genuine additions to the ontological inventory, over and above the physical furniture of the world.

### Historical Challenges

Princess Elizabeth of Bohemia pressed Descartes on a crucial difficulty: how can something unextended causally interact with something extended? If mind has no spatial location, how does it push on neurons? Descartes answered unsatisfactorily, pointing to the pineal gland without explaining how the interaction works.

Leibniz sharpened the objection by invoking conservation of momentum. If mind could push matter, it would have to inject energy. But physics says energy is conserved. The interaction seems to require either abandoning conservation laws or abandoning causal efficacy.

These objections pushed many philosophers toward alternatives: parallelism, [epiphenomenalism](/concepts/epiphenomenalism/), or materialism.

### Contemporary Substance Dualism

Modern substance dualists have resources unavailable to Descartes:

**Quantum mechanics** provides openings where conservation laws don't rule out mental causation. At quantum indeterminacies, physics specifies probabilities but not outcomes. Consciousness could select among possibilities without injecting energy—which is exactly what the site's [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) tenet proposes.

**Naturalistic substance dualism** (E.J. Lowe, Dean Zimmerman) accepts that mental substances are part of the natural world, just not part of the physical world as physics describes it. This avoids the Cartesian separation between nature and mind while preserving genuine ontological distinctness.

David Chalmers, initially a property dualist, has expressed preference for substance dualism in more recent work. He argues it better handles personal identity: if consciousness is just a property of physical systems, what persists through time is the physical system, not the consciousness. Substance dualism makes consciousness itself the persisting subject.

## Property Dualism

### The Core Claim

Property dualism holds that mental properties—the painfulness of pain, the redness of red, the what-it-is-like of experience—are not reducible to physical properties. A complete physical description of the brain leaves out something real: how it *feels*.

Unlike substance dualism, property dualism doesn't posit a separate mental substance. There are just physical objects (brains, neurons, organisms), but these objects have two fundamentally different kinds of properties: physical properties (mass, charge, spatial location) and phenomenal properties ([qualia](/concepts/qualia/)).

### Varieties of Property Dualism

**Naturalistic dualism** (Chalmers's early position) holds that phenomenal properties are fundamental features of nature, like mass or charge. They arise naturally from physical systems of sufficient complexity, but they're not identical to or derivable from physical properties. The laws connecting physical and phenomenal are psychophysical laws—fundamental, brute regularities that don't reduce to physics.

**Russellian monism** (some classify this as property dualism) holds that physics describes only the *relational* or *dispositional* properties of matter—what things do, not what they are intrinsically. Consciousness might be (or be grounded in) the intrinsic nature of physical reality that physics doesn't capture. This makes phenomenal properties more fundamental than physical properties, while preserving a single underlying reality.

**Emergent dualism** holds that mental properties emerge from physical complexity in ways that cannot be predicted or explained from physical theory alone. The emergence is ontological, not merely epistemic—mental properties are genuinely novel additions when complex systems arise.

### The Appeal of Property Dualism

Property dualism seems to require less ontological extravagance than substance dualism. It accepts the physical world as physics describes it, adding only that physical systems have phenomenal properties not captured by physical theory. You don't get mysterious mental substances floating around—just ordinary brains with extraordinary properties.

It also preserves the intuition that consciousness is closely tied to brains. A property dualist expects mental properties to track neural properties, to arise and cease with brain activity, to be affected by drugs and damage. This matches our experience better than views where mental substances might in principle exist independently of bodies.

## Comparing the Views

### Where They Agree

Both substance and property dualism share the central insight: [materialism](/arguments/materialism/) fails to account for consciousness. The knowledge argument (Mary's Room), conceivability arguments (zombies), and the intrinsic character of qualia all point toward something beyond physics. Whether you package this as separate substances or irreducible properties, you're affirming that the physical story leaves something out.

Both views are compatible with [interactionism](/concepts/interactionist-dualism/)—though historically, property dualists have sometimes been attracted to epiphenomenalism (mental properties are real but causally inert). The site's framework requires causal efficacy, which either ontology can accommodate.

### Where They Differ

**On what exists**: Substance dualism adds to the world's inventory. Besides physical objects, there are mental objects (minds, souls, subjects). Property dualism adds to the world's property types without adding objects—there are just physical objects with non-physical properties.

**On survival**: Substance dualism makes personal survival after bodily death conceivable in principle—if mind is a separate substance, it might persist when the body doesn't. Property dualism makes this harder to motivate—if mental properties depend on physical systems, they presumably cease when those systems do.

**On the combination problem**: Property dualism (especially Russellian monism) faces pressure toward [panpsychism](/concepts/panpsychism/)—if phenomenal properties are fundamental, they might be everywhere. But panpsychism faces the combination problem: how do micro-experiences combine into unified consciousness? Substance dualism avoids this by positing unified mental substances from the start.

**On parsimony**: Property dualism seems more parsimonious—same objects, different properties, rather than entirely new objects. But as the site's [Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occam) tenet notes, parsimony is a treacherous guide when our concepts may be inadequate.

## Which Does This Site Hold?

The site's tenets are deliberately neutral between substance and property dualism. What the tenets require:

- **Dualism**: Consciousness is not reducible to physical processes. (Either version delivers this.)
- **Bidirectional Interaction**: Consciousness causally influences physical outcomes. (Either version permits this—though property dualism must avoid the epiphenomenalist temptation.)
- **Minimal Quantum Interaction**: The interface is at quantum indeterminacies. (Either version is compatible.)

The choice between substance and property dualism affects how we think about personal identity, survival, and the metaphysics of mind. These are important questions, but they're downstream of the central commitment: consciousness is real, irreducible, and causally efficacious.

The site follows Chalmers's recent inclination toward substance dualism, partly because it better handles personal identity and partly because property dualism tends to slide toward either panpsychism (with its combination problem) or epiphenomenalism (which the Bidirectional Interaction tenet rejects). But this is a philosophical preference, not a doctrinal requirement.

## Relation to This Site's Perspective

The substance/property distinction matters less than it might seem for the site's core commitments:

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: Both versions satisfy this tenet. The claim is that consciousness is not reducible to physical processes—whether because it's a separate substance or an irreducible property type.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)**: This tenet actually constrains the choice somewhat. Epiphenomenalist property dualism is ruled out. If mental properties are real but causally inert, the tenet fails. Interactionist property dualism or substance dualism can satisfy it.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)**: Substance dualism handles this more naturally—there's a definite subject who finds themselves in one world, not all worlds. Property dualism must work harder to explain why *this* brain's phenomenal properties are *mine*.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occam)**: The tenet cuts against using parsimony to prefer property over substance dualism. Both face conceptual puzzles; neither is obviously simpler once we recognize how incomplete our understanding is.
