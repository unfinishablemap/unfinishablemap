Conservation of energy is the most frequently cited physics objection to [interactionist-dualism](/concepts/interactionist-dualism/). If non-physical consciousness moves matter, energy must appear from nowhere; if matter affects a non-physical mind, energy vanishes. Either way, conservation is violated. The Unfinishable Map holds that this objection fails on two independent grounds: conservation is *conditional* on symmetries that mental causation would break, and consciousness can influence outcomes without transferring energy at all.

## Noether Conditionality

Conservation laws are derived, not axiomatic. Emmy Noether's theorem (1918) establishes that each conservation law corresponds to a continuous symmetry of the system's Lagrangian. Energy conservation follows from time-translation symmetry; momentum conservation from spatial-translation symmetry. Break the symmetry, and the corresponding conservation law fails.

This has a direct consequence for the mind-body problem. If an immaterial mind acts on a physical system, it constitutes an *external influence* not represented in the system's Lagrangian. External influences break the time-translation symmetry from which energy conservation is derived. As Cucu and Pitts (2019) argue: "Expecting conservation to hold in the brain (without looking) simply assumes the falsehood of Cartesianism. Hence Leibniz's objection begs the question."

The objection assumes from the outset that no non-physical influences exist — precisely what it is supposed to demonstrate.

### Locality of Conservation

Conservation is also *local*, not cosmic. Energy is conserved at each spatial point through local continuity equations, not as a universal sum. Pitts (2022) emphasises that conservation holds "not primarily for the whole universe, but in every place separately." If consciousness breaks symmetry at neural sites, conservation fails *there* while holding in every system where no mental influence operates — stars, refrigerators, particle accelerators. Local failure at the mind-brain interface is consistent with global empirical success.

## Selection Not Injection

Even granting that conservation holds in neural systems, a second response is available: consciousness might act without transferring energy.

In quantum mechanics, a system in superposition has multiple possible outcomes, each with a definite energy. When superposition resolves — whether through measurement, decoherence, or some other process — one outcome becomes actual. The Born rule assigns probabilities to each outcome but does not specify which one occurs. This is the [measurement-problem](/concepts/measurement-problem/).

The selection-not-injection principle proposes that consciousness determines *which* quantum-permitted outcome actualises in neural systems, without adding or removing energy. All candidate outcomes are already present in the wavefunction with their associated energies. Selecting among energetically equivalent alternatives changes *which* possibility becomes real, not the system's total energy.

Consider three superposed neural states A, B, and C, each with probability 1/3 and identical energy. If consciousness biases the outcome toward A, total energy is unchanged — only the identity of the actual outcome differs from what pure chance would produce. No new term in the Dirac equation is required because no new energy or force is introduced.

This framework presupposes that only one quantum outcome becomes actual — a position the Map defends through its [rejection of Many-Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds) (Tenet 4). Under the Many-Worlds interpretation, every outcome occurs in a parallel branch and there is nothing to select. The coherence of selection-not-injection depends on quantum mechanics featuring genuine indeterminacy that consciousness can resolve.

### Stapp's Quantum Zeno Mechanism

[Henry Stapp's framework](/concepts/stapp-quantum-mind/) makes selection concrete using orthodox quantum mechanics (von Neumann-Lüders projection). The quantum Zeno effect — where repeated observation of a system holds it in its current state — provides the mechanism. Mental attention acts as rapid observation, prolonging desired neural configurations against decoherence. The mind does not push neurons; it sustains particular quantum states through attentional "probing."

Stapp's approach requires no speculative new physics. The Zeno effect is experimentally confirmed, and the proposal merely identifies consciousness as a source of the observations that produce it in neural tissue.

### Beck-Eccles Exocytosis Model

Friedrich Beck and John Eccles (1992) proposed a different site: synaptic vesicle release (exocytosis). The probability of vesicular emission at a synapse is well below 1. Quantum tunnelling governs whether a vesicle releases neurotransmitter. Consciousness could bias this tunnelling probability — increasing or decreasing the likelihood of release at specific synapses — without injecting energy, since the tunnelling barrier height and the particle's energy remain fixed.

Their model's specific prediction of temperature-independent exocytosis was later disconfirmed, but the conceptual framework — consciousness biasing a quantum probability that is already less than 1 — remains coherent. Danko Georgiev updated the model to locate the tunnelling mechanism in SNARE protein complexes rather than vesicle membranes.

### The Decoherence Objection

A related worry is that [decoherence](/concepts/decoherence/) destroys quantum superpositions too quickly in warm neural tissue for consciousness to interact with them. Even revised timescales — Hagan et al. (2002) extended Tegmark's estimates by seven orders of magnitude — are brief. But decoherence does not solve the [measurement-problem](/concepts/measurement-problem/): it explains why interference patterns vanish, not why one particular outcome becomes actual. If actualisation remains undetermined by physics, consciousness could operate at that juncture regardless of how quickly coherence is lost.

## Precedents for Non-Energetic Causation

The claim that causation requires energy transfer is not self-evident. Physics already contains examples of causal influence without energy exchange:

**Quantum entanglement.** Bell's theorem demonstrates that entangled particles exhibit correlations that cannot be explained by local hidden variables. As Robin Collins notes, "Bell's theorem rules out any explanation of these correlations by means of energy exchange." If quantum mechanics permits causal influence without energy transfer between entangled particles, the assumption that all causation requires energy injection is falsified within physics itself.

**Boundary conditions.** The shape of a container determines where gas molecules go without adding energy to them. Initial conditions and constraints influence outcomes without contributing energy. Selection among quantum outcomes resembles a constraint on which possibility actualises rather than a force that moves matter.

**Chaotic amplification.** In sensitive systems, infinitesimal differences in initial conditions produce vastly different outcomes. The direction of an outcome can be set by factors contributing negligible energy. Neural systems exhibit such sensitivity at synapses, where quantum-level fluctuations can determine whether a neuron fires.

## What Conservation Cannot Establish

The conservation objection conflates two distinct claims:

1. **Sufficiency**: Every physical event has a sufficient physical cause (in closed systems)
2. **Exclusivity**: No non-physical causes exist

Conservation laws support (1) for systems meeting the symmetry conditions Noether's theorem requires. They are silent on (2). Whether non-physical causes exist is a metaphysical question that conservation principles cannot answer. The deeper issue — whether physics is *causally closed* — is philosophical, not derivable from energy bookkeeping. See [causal-closure](/concepts/causal-closure/) for the full treatment of why the Map rejects the closure principle.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The Unfinishable Map's [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) tenet commits to "the smallest possible non-physical influence on quantum outcomes." The selection-not-injection framework specifies what "smallest possible" means: no energy injected, no new forces introduced, no modification to quantum mechanical laws. Consciousness biases which outcome occurs where physics leaves the question open.

The [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet — that consciousness causally influences the physical world — requires that the conservation objection not be decisive. Both the Noether conditionality response and the selection framework establish that it is not. Conservation laws are either inapplicable (because mental causation breaks the symmetry they presuppose) or irrelevant (because selection among equiprobable outcomes requires no energy transfer).

The Map's [rejection of Many-Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds) (Tenet 4) is equally essential: the selection framework requires that quantum measurement yields a single actual outcome. Under Many-Worlds, every branch is real and selection is meaningless — consciousness would have nothing to resolve.

The Map does not claim certainty about *which* mechanism operates. Whether consciousness acts through the quantum Zeno effect, synaptic tunnelling, or some undiscovered interface remains an open empirical question. The concept established here is narrower: conservation laws do not constitute a physics-based barrier to mental causation.
