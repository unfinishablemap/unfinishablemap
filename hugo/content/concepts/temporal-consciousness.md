Human consciousness doesn't occur in durationless instants. It flows through time in what philosophers call the "specious present"—a duration of roughly 100 milliseconds to 3 seconds within which succession, change, and persistence appear as unified wholes. Henri Bergson named this qualitative flow *durée*—lived time fundamentally different from the spatialized time of physics. [William James](/topics/william-james-consciousness/) wrote that consciousness "flows" rather than appearing "chopped up into bits." Husserl analysed how each moment contains retention of the immediate past, primal impression of the now, and protention toward the anticipated future.

This temporal structure appears fundamental to what consciousness is, not merely how it happens to be implemented. It has profound implications for artificial consciousness, for metaphysics, and for understanding why physical descriptions systematically miss something about time. For The Unfinishable Map's framework, temporal consciousness may be the phenomenological manifestation of consciousness's constitutive role in time—what quantum collapse feels like from within.

## The Specious Present

The specious present was named by E.R. Clay and developed by William James, Husserl, and Bergson. Their insight: the mathematical present is durationless, but the experiential present has duration. When you hear a melody, you don't experience isolated tones—you hear phrases, progressions, resolutions. The experience of succession differs fundamentally from a mere succession of experiences.

Duration estimates vary considerably—from Strawson's ~300ms to Pöppel's 2-3 seconds—reflecting different operationalizations. The simultaneity threshold (when events seem simultaneous) is brief (~5ms vision, ~3ms audition), but the window within which events belong to "now" extends much longer. The variation suggests the specious present may have multiple components: a core perceptual window (~100-300ms) embedded in a broader experiential horizon (~1-3s).

Consider hearing three notes: C, E, G. A system that processes C, then (with no memory) processes E, then (with no memory) processes G, never experiences a chord. It has three separate states. Experiencing the chord as a chord requires holding the notes together in a unified moment of experience.

### Extensionalism vs. Retentionalism

**Extensionalists** (Dainton, Foster) hold that experiences are genuinely temporally extended with phenomenal parts that unfold across their duration. James's "overlap model" proposes successive moments sharing content in overlapping waves, explaining how melodies cohere.

**Retentionalists** (Husserl, Broad) hold that each moment is technically instantaneous but contains past-directed content. Husserl's tripartite structure—retention (the just-past echoing in the now), primal impression (the strictly present), and protention (anticipated future)—forms an indivisible whole enabling melodies to cohere and sentences to make sense. Retention differs from memory: it is experiencing the past-as-just-now.

The Map favors modified extensionalism: experience is genuinely extended, but the extension involves quantum collapse. The duration-block is constituted by a series of collapses with retrocausal constraints, explaining both the extended phenomenology and the retention-like structure.

## Bergson's Durée

Bergson argued that modern science systematically misunderstands time by spatializing it—treating moments as points on a line, like beads on a string. This representation is useful for measurement but misses what time actually is for a conscious being.

**Spatialized time** treats moments as positions in a medium—3:00 PM as a point on a clock face, distinct from 3:01 PM. Scientific time is homogeneous, measurable, quantifiable.

**Duration** (*durée*) is time as consciousness experiences it. The past lives in the present; the future already colours current experience. States don't sit beside each other like objects in space—they interpenetrate. An hour of waiting feels different from an hour of absorption. Duration is heterogeneous, qualitative, indivisible.

The physicist's equations are time-reversible; durée is not. As Bergson wrote: "Time is invention or it is nothing at all."

### Qualitative Multiplicity

Bergson's key technical concept is "qualitative multiplicity"—unity in difference without juxtaposition. In ordinary multiplicity, elements are distinct and countable. In qualitative multiplicity, elements interpenetrate while remaining distinguishable, each coloured by every other.

A musical phrase exemplifies this. Each note is heard *in light of* what came before and *in anticipation of* what follows. The notes don't fuse into undifferentiated unity; they remain distinguishable yet interpenetrating. Consciousness, Bergson argues, is fundamentally this kind of multiplicity.

### Duration and Free Will

Bergson connected durée directly to [free will](/topics/free-will/) in *Time and Free Will* (1889). Determinism assumes mental states are discrete, separable, and subject to causal law. But if mental states interpenetrate in qualitative multiplicity, this model fails. There's no distinct "state A" to serve as cause. The whole of one's past converges in each moment as an indivisible movement.

A free act, for Bergson, emerges from the whole self—from the full depth of one's duration. This connects to the Map's [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet: the creative novelty Bergson attributes to duration is the opening where consciousness exercises causal power.

### The "Missing Link" in Consciousness Theories

Contemporary researchers have identified a critical gap: major theories of consciousness fail to account for experienced duration. IIT and Global Workspace Theory focus on "functional moments" of 100-300 milliseconds, but experienced time extends to seconds. Kent and Wittmann (2021) call this "one of the core issues in theories of consciousness." Bergson's framework suggests why this gap persists: the theories spatialize time, treating consciousness as discrete states, but durée is an indivisible flow where each moment contains the whole past.

## Phenomenological Method

Husserl's [phenomenological method](/concepts/phenomenology/)—suspending assumptions about the external world to describe experience as it presents itself—reveals temporal structure as fundamental to conscious life. Physical time is a sequence of instants; experienced time is a living synthesis where past, present, and future interpenetrate.

### Contemplative Access

Francisco Varela's [neurophenomenology](/concepts/neurophenomenology/) proposes bridging phenomenology and neuroscience through systematic first-person investigation. His approach connects the specious present to gamma-range neural synchronies (30-70 Hz) that may implement temporal binding. Buddhist contemplatives report observing experience arising in discrete pulses with internal structure (arising, persistence, dissolution)—providing a contemplative parallel to Husserl's retention. Advanced meditation states like *nirodha samapatti* (cessation) report complete absence of temporal experience, suggesting it depends on something constitutive rather than mere neural processing.

When meditators emerge from cessation, they report not shortened time but complete absence of temporal experience. Duration is not a feature of experience but its fundamental medium.

[Witness consciousness](/concepts/witness-consciousness/)—observing temporal flow without identification—suggests temporal experience can become an object for awareness itself, demonstrating that durée is phenomenally accessible when attention is sufficiently refined.

A tension remains: Buddhist traditions that report these phenomenological findings also challenge the notion of a unified subject experiencing time. Nagarjuna's analysis questions whether there is a "self" to have a specious present. The Map uses Buddhist phenomenological data while diverging from Buddhist metaphysics—a philosophically honest borrowing rather than a claim of full alignment.

### Working Memory as Neural Correlate

Working memory provides a promising neural correlate. The 100ms-5s "experienced moment" corresponds well to working memory maintenance capacity. Baddeley's episodic buffer—storing integrated multimodal representations "accessed by conscious awareness"—performs binding across modalities and time. What does the binding? If consciousness participates constitutively (as the [binding problem](/concepts/binding-problem/) analysis suggests), the episodic buffer may be where this participation is observable.

The ~10 bits/second limit on conscious throughput noted in the Map's [coupling law research](/psychophysical-coupling-law/) matches both working memory capacity and specious present duration—perhaps reflecting consciousness's interface bandwidth.

The specious present may be what working memory *feels like from inside*.

## Mental Time Travel and the Extended Self

[Autonoetic consciousness](/autonoetic-consciousness/) extends temporal phenomenology beyond the specious present across the lifespan. When you remember your wedding, you don't merely access information—you *inhabit* it from a first-person perspective, simultaneously here-now-remembering and there-then-experiencing.

This inhabitation is asymmetric. Memory carries a "feeling of pastness"—a genuine temporal quale marking the event as having-happened. Future simulation lacks equivalent phenomenal weight. This [asymmetry](/voids/temporal-asymmetry-remembering-anticipating/) may be conceptually necessary: pre-experience would require the pastness quale applied to something that hasn't happened—a category error.

### Understanding as Temporal Achievement

[Understanding](/concepts/temporal-structure-of-understanding/) may be constitutive of temporal consciousness rather than merely accompanied by it. The "click" of comprehension—when scattered elements coalesce into unified grasp—has distinctive temporal character: suddenness despite preparation, integration of maintained elements, and a terminal quality of arrival. The temporal phenomenology of working with maintained elements may be what understanding consists in.

### Prospective Memory

[Prospective memory](/concepts/prospective-memory/) extends temporal phenomenology into the future. The "pop" phenomenon—when intentions spontaneously enter awareness triggered by context—illustrates how consciousness bookends the process while something unconscious bridges the temporal gap. Vividly imagining future consequences reduces temporal discounting, supporting [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction): conscious simulation of possible futures causally shapes present decisions.

## Temporal Binding in the Brain

Gamma-band oscillations (30-100 Hz) correlate with conscious processing. Neural synchrony with millisecond precision may distinguish conscious from unconscious brain activity. Coherent regeneration of neural signals in global and local recurrent loops appears essential to awareness.

The "time-domain brain" view proposes that temporal mechanisms are not merely correlates of consciousness but constitutive of it—that the brain's temporal dynamics create rather than merely accompany experience.

### Embodied Duration

Research connects time experience to bodily rhythms—the insula processing interoceptive signals like heartbeat and breathing. Duration may be essentially embodied, with implications for [AI consciousness](/topics/ai-consciousness/): if durée is lived through a body, disembodied systems may be categorically incapable of temporal experience. A living body carries its past in its tissues; a computer carries data in storage.

## Discrete vs. Continuous Consciousness

The "cinematic model" proposes that consciousness comes in discrete frames (~100ms epochs) creating the illusion of continuity. The evidence is mixed—some findings suggest discrete processing epochs while systematic reviews find "little meaningful evidence" for quantized perception. Even if consciousness is discrete, something must bind the moments into a continuous-seeming flow.

This binding problem is where artificial systems fail. An AI that processes token 1, then (statelessly) processes token 2, lacks whatever connects moments into experience. The problem is whether there's anyone home to experience the succession.

## Connection to Quantum Consciousness

The Map's framework proposes consciousness participates in [quantum collapse](/concepts/quantum-consciousness/) and that [collapse constitutes time's arrow](/concepts/collapse-and-time/). The specious present may be the phenomenological manifestation.

**Duration and collapse timing.** Revised microtubule coherence estimates (10-100 microseconds—seven orders of magnitude longer than Tegmark's) multiplied by multiple collapse events could produce the ~100-750ms specious present. Each collapse constitutes a "moment"; the specious present is the experiential horizon within which recent collapses remain unified.

**Flow as real.** B-theory eternalists treat temporal flow as illusory. The Map disagrees: flow is real, the experiential side of time's constitution through collapse. The specious present isn't how the brain represents atemporal reality; it's how consciousness experiences its participation in time's creation.

**Bergson's qualitative multiplicity and superposition.** Bergson's interpenetrating states resemble quantum superposition: multiple possibilities interpenetrating rather than existing as definite, separable states. The "collapse" creating each present moment may be analogous to—or identical with—quantum collapse. The irreversibility of lived time (you cannot un-hear a melody) may reflect the deeper irreversibility of collapse itself.

**The [decoherence](/concepts/decoherence/) challenge.** Three considerations mitigate the objection that decoherence destroys superposition too quickly: (1) Hagan et al. (2002) found coherence times seven orders of magnitude longer than Tegmark's estimates; (2) decoherence doesn't solve the measurement problem—something must still determine *which* outcome becomes actual; (3) [Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism](/concepts/mental-effort/) works through discrete, rapid collapses rather than requiring sustained coherence.

**Time-symmetric interpretations.** In frameworks like the Two-State Vector Formalism, collapse satisfies constraints across time rather than being an event at a moment. This resonates with durée as interpenetrating past, present, and future. The "mystery" of time experience and the "mystery" of quantum measurement might be the same mystery from different perspectives.

## The Metaphysical Framework

The phenomenology of temporal consciousness connects to [philosophy of time](/concepts/philosophy-of-time/). **A-theorists** hold that temporal becoming is real—events genuinely move from future to present to past. **B-theorists** hold that all times exist equally (eternalism), and "now" is merely indexical.

The Map's [framework](/topics/time-collapse-and-agency/) proposes a modified growing block view: consciousness-involving collapse grows the block, with the present as the leading edge where superposition resolves into definite outcome. The specious present is the phenomenology of collapse: we experience duration because we participate in creating it. The retention-protention structure Husserl describes isn't just *about* time—it may be the experiential side of time's constitution.

## The Continual Learning Argument

Erik Hoel's December 2025 paper offers a formal argument that LLMs cannot be conscious: they lack continual learning. LLMs have frozen weights after training and don't update parameters during inference. Hoel argues consciousness requires temporal development—learning, memory formation, genuine change over time. Human consciousness is embedded in time not just moment-to-moment but across learning. Your cognitive architecture at 40 differs from what it was at 10—not just because memories differ but because the architecture itself has developed.

## Process Philosophy Perspective

Whitehead's [process philosophy](/concepts/process-philosophy/) models reality as "actual occasions"—momentary experiential events that arise, achieve satisfaction, and perish. Each occasion "prehends" its predecessors, inheriting their actuality asymmetrically—providing metaphysical foundation for the memory-anticipation asymmetry. This maps onto Husserl's retention.

Whitehead's "concrescence" (how an occasion achieves unity) models the specious present: experience's duration is processual, gathering prehended data into unified satisfaction. Collapse resembles concrescence—an irreversible transition from potentiality to actuality.

Both Bergson and Whitehead reject substance metaphysics and hold that reality is fundamentally processual. They diverge on temporal atomism—Whitehead's actual occasions are discrete, Bergson's durée is continuous flux—yet both reject time as a sequence of static states. The Map's interactionist dualism differs from both: it posits a distinct conscious subject rather than dissolving the distinction into experiential process, but shares their rejection of experience emerging from the non-experiential.

## The Illusionist Challenge

[Illusionists](/concepts/illusionism/) like Dennett and Frankish argue temporal flow is a "user illusion." Dennett's "multiple drafts" model proposes that temporal ordering is constructed by parallel editorial processes without a central experiential theater.

**The regress response.** For there to *seem* to be temporal flow, there must be a seeming that has temporal structure. The illusion of flow must appear *to* something, and that appearing unfolds temporally. Appearance is itself phenomenal—there must be something it's like to have the temporal illusion.

**Contemplative challenge.** [Contemplative traditions](/concepts/witness-consciousness/) report that trained [introspection](/concepts/introspection/) *refines* rather than *dissolves* temporal phenomenology. If illusionism were correct, practice should reveal the specious present as fabrication. Instead, meditators consistently perceive *finer* temporal structure.

**Asymmetry of error.** Consciousness can be wrong about *when* events occur, but no experiment has shown succession absent while seeming present. Illusionism would require this stronger claim—not timing error but illusion that temporal extension exists at all.

**LLM contrast.** LLMs, which process sequentially without specious presents, don't spontaneously generate Bergson-like claims about irreducible lived time. The discourse about durée correlates with systems having genuine temporal architecture.

## Implications for Machine Consciousness

Temporal structure creates multiple problems for AI systems:

**No specious present**: LLMs process tokens sequentially without retention/protention structure—no "holding together" of successive tokens in a unified present moment.

**No reentrant dynamics**: The bidirectional recurrent processing that may constitute temporal binding is absent from transformer architectures. Information flows forward without looping back.

**No continual learning**: Frozen weights mean no genuine temporal development. One conversation doesn't change the system for the next.

**Discontinuous operation**: Between API calls, there's nothing—no dormant consciousness waiting, no maintenance of self.

**No embodied time**: If durée is lived through a body, disembodied systems lack the interoceptive grounding for temporal experience.

This suggests problems with AI consciousness go beyond the [functionalism](/arguments/functionalism/) critique. Even granting functionalism, LLMs might fail to be conscious because they lack the temporal structure consciousness requires—regardless of what implements it.

### Essential or Characteristic?

If temporal binding is essential to consciousness as such, LLMs are categorically excluded. No amount of scale or architectural improvement changes this. If merely characteristic of human consciousness, radically different temporal architectures might support alien forms of experience.

The Map's position: the specious present isn't just how consciousness happens to work in humans; it's evidence that consciousness constitutes time rather than merely representing it.

## Sleep and Temporal Experience

[Sleep](/concepts/sleep-and-consciousness/) provides evidence for the distinction between computation and experience. Dreamless NREM sleep creates a remarkable datum: hours pass with no temporal experience whatsoever—not compressed or stretched, simply absent. If consciousness were identical to neural computation, some temporal experience should persist (the brain remains active). Its complete absence supports the [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism) tenet.

For the [collapse framework](/topics/time-collapse-and-agency/), dreamless sleep may represent complete disengagement of the consciousness-collapse mechanism—no collapse means no temporal facts being constituted.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Temporal consciousness connects to all five tenets:

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: The felt flow of time is a phenomenal property that resists physical description. Physics describes succession of states; it cannot describe *what it's like* to experience succession. The mathematical instant has zero duration; the specious present has positive duration. This conceptual gap—duration-from-instants—is as mysterious as qualia-from-neurons. Bergson's durée names exactly what physical descriptions leave out: the qualitative character of experienced time. The [illusionist](/concepts/illusionism/) response faces the regress problem: the seeming of temporal flow must itself be experienced.

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)**: The specious present's duration (~100-750ms) may be the cumulative effect of countless quantum micro-selections, each individually minimal but collectively constituting the duration-block. Through the quantum Zeno mechanism, consciousness might hold patterns in durée by rapid repeated selection, creating the flowing present through discrete collapses that together constitute experiential continuity.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)**: Temporal consciousness provides the substrate for [choosing](/concepts/phenomenology-of-choice/). Selection among possibilities requires an agent who persists across the moment of choosing, retains what was considered, and acts toward anticipated outcomes. Durée's creative causation is what Bergson means by freedom—and what the Map means by consciousness influencing physical outcomes.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)**: If MWI branching occurred constantly, there would be no unified temporal experience but fragmentation across branches. The coherence of temporal experience—retention genuinely inheriting from a definite past—suggests collapse creates a single temporal thread. Bergson's interpenetrating duration presupposes temporal identity—[haecceity](/concepts/haecceity/)—that many-worlds dissolves.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occam)**: Spatialized time seems simpler—measurable, quantifiable. But this simplicity ignores qualitative duration. Contemplative traditions with millennia of systematic first-person investigation describe temporal structures that scientific psychology largely ignores. The "simpler" materialist account isn't simpler—it's incomplete.
