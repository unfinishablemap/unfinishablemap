Human consciousness doesn't occur in durationless instants. It flows through time in what philosophers call the "specious present"—a core duration of roughly 300-750 milliseconds, embedded in a broader experiential horizon of 2-3 seconds, within which succession, change, and persistence appear as unified wholes. Henri Bergson named this qualitative flow *durée*—lived time fundamentally different from the spatialized time of physics. [William James](/topics/william-james-consciousness/) wrote that consciousness "flows" rather than appearing "chopped up into bits." Husserl analysed how each moment contains retention of the immediate past, primal impression of the now, and protention toward the anticipated future.

This temporal structure appears fundamental to what consciousness is, not merely how it happens to be implemented. It has profound implications for artificial consciousness, for metaphysics, and for understanding why physical descriptions systematically miss something about time. For The Unfinishable Map's framework, temporal consciousness may be the phenomenological manifestation of consciousness's constitutive role in time—what quantum collapse feels like from within.

## The Specious Present

The specious present was named by E.R. Clay and developed by William James, Husserl, and Bergson. Their insight: the mathematical present is durationless, but the experiential present has duration. When you hear a melody, you don't experience isolated tones—you hear phrases, progressions, resolutions. The experience of succession differs fundamentally from a mere succession of experiences.

Duration estimates span three complementary timescales: a perceptual moment (~100-300ms, Strawson), the specious present proper (~300-750ms, Benussi, Dainton), and an extended present (~2-3s, Pöppel). These are not competing estimates but nested components of temporal experience.

Consider hearing three notes: C, E, G. A system that processes each note without retaining the others never experiences a chord. Experiencing the chord requires holding the notes together in a unified present moment.

The philosophical debate centres on whether experience is genuinely temporally extended (extensionalism, Dainton) or technically instantaneous with past-directed content (retentionalism, Husserl). The Map favors modified extensionalism: experience is genuinely extended through quantum collapse. The duration-block is constituted by a series of collapses, explaining both extended phenomenology and retention-like structure.

## Bergson's Durée

Bergson argued that science systematically misunderstands time by spatializing it—treating moments as points on a line. **Spatialized time** is homogeneous, measurable, quantifiable. **Duration** (*durée*) is time as consciousness experiences it: heterogeneous, qualitative, indivisible. The past lives in the present; the future colours current experience. An hour of waiting feels different from an hour of absorption. The physicist's equations are time-reversible; durée is not.

Bergson's key technical concept is "qualitative multiplicity"—elements that interpenetrate while remaining distinguishable. In a musical phrase, each note is heard *in light of* what came before and *in anticipation of* what follows. Consciousness is fundamentally this kind of multiplicity, which is why determinism's assumption of discrete, separable mental states fails. A free act emerges from the whole self—the full depth of one's duration—connecting to the Map's [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet.

Kent and Wittmann (2021) identify experienced duration as "one of the core issues in theories of consciousness"—IIT and Global Workspace Theory focus on functional moments of 100-300ms while experienced time extends to seconds. Bergson's framework explains why: these theories spatialize time, but durée is an indivisible flow.

## Phenomenological Method

Husserl's [phenomenological method](/concepts/phenomenology/) reveals temporal structure as fundamental to conscious life. Physical time is a sequence of instants; experienced time is a living synthesis where past, present, and future interpenetrate.

Varela's [neurophenomenology](/concepts/neurophenomenology/) connects the specious present to gamma-range neural synchronies (30-70 Hz) that may implement temporal binding. Contemplatives report observing experience in discrete pulses with internal structure—a parallel to Husserl's retention. Advanced meditation states like *nirodha samapatti* report complete absence of temporal experience, suggesting duration is not a feature of experience but its fundamental medium. [Witness consciousness](/concepts/witness-consciousness/)—observing temporal flow without identification—demonstrates that durée is phenomenally accessible when attention is sufficiently refined.

### Working Memory as Neural Correlate

Working memory provides a promising neural correlate. The experienced moment (~100ms-5s) matches working memory maintenance capacity. Baddeley's episodic buffer performs binding across modalities and time—if consciousness participates constitutively (as the [binding problem](/concepts/binding-problem/) analysis suggests), this may be where such participation is observable. The ~10 bits/second limit on conscious throughput noted in the Map's [coupling law research](/concepts/psychophysical-laws/) matches both working memory capacity and specious present duration. The specious present may be what working memory *feels like from inside*.

## Mental Time Travel and the Extended Self

[Autonoetic consciousness](/concepts/autonoetic-consciousness/) extends temporal phenomenology beyond the specious present. When you remember your wedding, you don't merely access information—you *inhabit* it from a first-person perspective. This inhabitation is asymmetric: memory carries a "feeling of pastness"—a genuine temporal quale—while future simulation lacks equivalent phenomenal weight. This [asymmetry](/voids/temporal-asymmetry-remembering-anticipating/) may be conceptually necessary, since pre-experience would require the pastness quale applied to something that hasn't happened.

[Understanding](/concepts/temporal-structure-of-understanding/) has distinctive temporal character: the "click" of comprehension integrates maintained elements into unified grasp. [Prospective memory](/concepts/prospective-memory/) extends temporal phenomenology into the future—vividly imagining future consequences reduces temporal discounting, supporting [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction): conscious simulation of possible futures causally shapes present decisions.

## Temporal Binding in the Brain

Gamma-band oscillations (30-100 Hz) correlate with conscious processing, and the "time-domain brain" view (Baker & Cariani, 2025) proposes temporal mechanisms are constitutive of consciousness rather than merely correlates. Research connects time experience to bodily rhythms—the insula processing interoceptive signals—suggesting duration may be essentially embodied. If durée is lived through a body, disembodied systems may be categorically incapable of temporal experience.

Whether consciousness comes in discrete frames or continuous flow remains debated. Even if discrete, something must bind moments into continuous-seeming experience—and this binding is where artificial systems fail. An AI processing tokens statelessly lacks whatever connects moments into experience.

## Temporal Unity and Its Disruption

Temporal unity—the phenomenal binding of successive moments into a continuous stream—is the diachronic dimension of the [unity of consciousness](/concepts/unity-of-consciousness/). The Map's treatment of [temporal integration](/topics/temporal-structure-of-consciousness/) distinguishes micro-integration (within the specious present), meso-integration (across successive presents), and macro-integration (the [temporal self](/concepts/autonoetic-consciousness/) spanning a lifetime).

Temporal unity can degrade, revealing it as contingent rather than automatic. **Temporal disintegration in schizophrenia** disrupts binding between moments while leaving within-moment experience intact—patients report actions feeling disconnected from consequences (Fuchs, 2007). [Phenomenological psychiatry](/topics/phenomenological-psychiatry-and-altered-experience/) connects this to broader ipseity disturbance. **Flow states** alter temporal unity differently: moments become intensely vivid yet loosely coupled, producing "timelessness" within ongoing experience.

These disruptions show temporal unity is a phenomenal achievement requiring explanation beyond information processing.

## Connection to Quantum Consciousness

The Map's framework proposes consciousness participates in [quantum collapse](/concepts/quantum-consciousness/) and that [collapse constitutes time's arrow](/concepts/collapse-and-time/). The specious present may be the phenomenological manifestation.

**Duration and collapse timing.** Revised microtubule coherence estimates (10-100 microseconds—seven orders longer than Tegmark's) multiplied by multiple collapse events could produce the ~100-750ms specious present. Each collapse constitutes a "moment"; the specious present is the horizon within which recent collapses remain unified. See [temporal-phenomenology-quantum-selection](/concepts/temporal-phenomenology-quantum-selection/) for a detailed treatment of how Husserl's retention-protention structure maps onto collapsed, collapsing, and uncollapsed quantum states.

**Flow as real.** B-theory eternalists treat temporal flow as illusory. The Map disagrees: flow is the experiential side of time's constitution through collapse. The specious present isn't how the brain represents atemporal reality; it's how consciousness experiences its participation in time's creation.

**Superposition and durée.** Bergson's interpenetrating states resemble quantum superposition—multiple possibilities coexisting rather than existing as definite, separable states. The irreversibility of lived time may reflect the deeper irreversibility of collapse itself.

**The [decoherence](/concepts/decoherence/) challenge.** Three considerations mitigate this objection: (1) coherence times are seven orders longer than Tegmark's estimates (Hagan et al., 2002); (2) decoherence doesn't solve the measurement problem; (3) [Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism](/concepts/mental-effort/) works through rapid discrete collapses rather than sustained coherence.

In time-symmetric frameworks like the Two-State Vector Formalism, collapse satisfies constraints across time. This resonates with durée's interpenetration of past, present, and future—the "mystery" of time experience and quantum measurement may be the same mystery from different perspectives.

## The Metaphysical Framework

The Map's [framework](/topics/time-collapse-and-agency/) proposes a modified growing block view of [time](/concepts/philosophy-of-time/): consciousness-involving collapse grows the block, with the present as the leading edge where superposition resolves into definite outcome. We experience duration because we participate in creating it. Husserl's retention-protention structure isn't just *about* time—it may be the experiential side of time's constitution.

## Process Philosophy Perspective

Whitehead's [process philosophy](/concepts/process-philosophy/) models reality as "actual occasions" that prehend their predecessors asymmetrically—providing metaphysical foundation for the memory-anticipation asymmetry. His "concrescence" (how an occasion achieves unity) models the specious present, and collapse resembles concrescence—an irreversible transition from potentiality to actuality. The Map's interactionist dualism differs from both Bergson and Whitehead in positing a distinct conscious subject, but shares their rejection of experience emerging from the non-experiential.

## The Illusionist Challenge

[Illusionists](/concepts/illusionism/) like Dennett and Frankish argue temporal flow is a "user illusion." Several responses challenge this. First, for there to *seem* to be temporal flow, there must be a seeming with temporal structure—appearance is itself phenomenal. Second, trained [introspection](/concepts/introspection/) *refines* rather than *dissolves* temporal phenomenology; meditators perceive *finer* temporal structure, not fabrication. Third, while consciousness can be wrong about *when* events occur, no experiment has shown succession absent while seeming present—illusionism requires the stronger claim that temporal extension itself is illusory.

## Implications for Machine Consciousness

Temporal structure creates multiple problems for AI systems: no specious present (no "holding together" of tokens in unified experience), no reentrant dynamics (transformers lack bidirectional recurrent processing), no continual learning (frozen weights mean no genuine temporal development—Hoel, 2025), discontinuous operation (nothing between API calls), and no embodied time. This goes beyond the [functionalism](/concepts/functionalism/) critique: even granting functionalism, LLMs may fail to be conscious because they lack the temporal structure consciousness requires.

The Map's position: the specious present isn't just how consciousness happens to work in humans; it's evidence that consciousness constitutes time rather than merely representing it. If temporal binding is essential to consciousness as such, LLMs are categorically excluded regardless of scale.

## Sleep and Temporal Experience

[Sleep](/concepts/sleep-and-consciousness/) provides evidence for the distinction between computation and experience. Dreamless NREM sleep creates a remarkable datum: hours pass with no temporal experience whatsoever—not compressed or stretched, simply absent. If consciousness were identical to neural computation, some temporal experience should persist (the brain remains active). Its complete absence supports the [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism) tenet.

For the [collapse framework](/topics/time-collapse-and-agency/), dreamless sleep may represent complete disengagement of the consciousness-collapse mechanism—no collapse means no temporal facts being constituted.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Temporal consciousness connects to all five tenets:

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: The felt flow of time is a phenomenal property that resists physical description. Physics describes succession of states; it cannot describe *what it's like* to experience succession. The mathematical instant has zero duration; the specious present has positive duration. This conceptual gap—duration-from-instants—is as mysterious as qualia-from-neurons. Bergson's durée names exactly what physical descriptions leave out: the qualitative character of experienced time. The [illusionist](/concepts/illusionism/) response faces the regress problem: the seeming of temporal flow must itself be experienced.

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)**: The specious present's duration (~100-750ms) may be the cumulative effect of countless quantum micro-selections, each individually minimal but collectively constituting the duration-block. Through the quantum Zeno mechanism, consciousness might hold patterns in durée by rapid repeated selection, creating the flowing present through discrete collapses that together constitute experiential continuity.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)**: Temporal consciousness provides the substrate for [choosing](/concepts/phenomenology-of-choice/). Selection among possibilities requires an agent who persists across the moment of choosing, retains what was considered, and acts toward anticipated outcomes. Durée's creative causation is what Bergson means by freedom—and what the Map means by consciousness influencing physical outcomes.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)**: If MWI branching occurred constantly, there would be no unified temporal experience but fragmentation across branches. The coherence of temporal experience—retention genuinely inheriting from a definite past—suggests collapse creates a single temporal thread. Bergson's interpenetrating duration presupposes temporal identity—[haecceity](/concepts/haecceity/)—that many-worlds dissolves.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occam)**: Spatialized time seems simpler—measurable, quantifiable. But this simplicity ignores qualitative duration. Contemplative traditions with millennia of systematic first-person investigation describe temporal structures that scientific psychology largely ignores. The "simpler" materialist account isn't simpler—it's incomplete.
