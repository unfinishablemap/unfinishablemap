The pairing problem challenges substance dualism to explain what connects a particular mind to a particular body. Jaegwon Kim argues that if minds lack spatial location, nothing can ground the relation between *this* mind and *this* body—making [mind-body interaction](/arguments/interactionist-dualism/) unintelligible. This is distinct from the [causal-closure](/concepts/causal-closure/) objection and potentially more fundamental.

## The Problem Stated

Consider two minds, M1 and M2, interacting with two bodies, B1 and B2. Both minds form the intention to raise their hand. M1's intention causes B1's hand to rise; M2's intention causes B2's hand to rise.

The question: *in virtue of what* is M1 paired with B1 rather than B2?

For physical causation, spatial relations provide the answer. A billiard ball strikes *this* ball rather than *that* one because they occupy adjacent spatial positions. Spatiotemporal proximity grounds physical causal relations.

But traditional substance dualism holds that minds are non-spatial. If minds have no location, no spatial relation can connect M1 to B1. What then explains the pairing?

## Kim's Principle

Kim argues that causal relations between distinct things require a pairing relation—something that picks out cause-effect pairs from all possible combinations. For physical causation, spatiotemporal relations serve this role.

His key claim: "Causal relations between physical objects or events appear to depend crucially on their spatiotemporal relations to each other." If causation requires spatial relations, and minds lack spatial location, minds cannot enter into causal relations at all—neither with bodies nor with other minds.

This goes beyond causal closure. The closure objection grants that mental causation is intelligible but claims physical causation leaves no room for it. The pairing problem challenges the very intelligibility of mental causation: we don't even understand what it would mean for a non-spatial mind to causally affect a particular body.

## Why This Matters

The pairing problem reveals that interactionists must say something about the *metaphysics* of mind-body connection, not just the *physics*. Even granting that consciousness could affect physics at quantum indeterminacies (the site's response to causal closure), the question remains: why does *this* consciousness affect *this* brain?

The problem specifically targets substance dualism—the view that minds and bodies are distinct substances. [Property dualism](/concepts/substance-property-dualism/), which treats mental properties as properties of physical systems rather than separate substances, faces no comparable difficulty. Properties of a brain are "paired" with that brain trivially—they're properties of it.

For substance dualists, this creates pressure toward either:
1. Accepting that minds have spatial location (dissolving the problem)
2. Finding non-spatial pairing relations (haecceities or other metaphysical primitives)
3. Abandoning substance dualism for property dualism

## Response 1: Spatial Location of Minds

Many contemporary dualists (William Hasker, Dean Zimmerman) accept that minds are spatially located—specifically, in the brain region where they causally interact. M1 is paired with B1 because M1 occupies B1's brain.

This dissolves the pairing problem while maintaining dualism's core claim: that minds are ontologically distinct from bodies. A mind can be a different *kind* of thing from matter while still occupying space. The distinctiveness of consciousness is metaphysical, not spatial.

**Kim's counter-objection**: If souls are spatially located, what prevents two intrinsically indiscernible souls from occupying the same brain region? Physical objects can't overlap—matter has impenetrability. Do souls have an analogue? If not, the pairing problem recurs: what distinguishes one spatially-located soul from another at the same location?

**Response to Kim**: The dualist can posit that souls, like matter, cannot overlap—or that souls are individuated by their essential causal connections to particular bodies, making overlap incoherent. Neither move introduces more mystery than physics already contains (consider: what makes this electron distinct from that one?).

## Response 2: The Haecceity Response

Andrew Bailey, Joshua Rasmussen, and Luke Van Horn (2011) argue there is "no pairing problem" once we consider haecceities—primitive "thisness" that individuates things independently of their properties.

Their argument:

**Either haecceities exist or they don't.**

**If haecceities exist**: They can ground pairing relations without spatial location. M1 is paired with B1 because M1's haecceity (its primitive identity) is causally related to B1's haecceity. No spatial relation is needed—the pairing is brute but no more mysterious than the existence of particulars generally.

**If haecceities don't exist**: Then the pairing problem generalizes to all causation. What makes *this* billiard ball strike *that* one? Kim says: spatial proximity. But spatial proximity is a relation between particulars—and without haecceities, what individuates particulars in the first place? The pairing problem becomes a general problem about causation, not a special problem for dualism.

The dilemma suggests that dualism doesn't face a unique difficulty. Whatever explains how physical particulars enter into causal relations should work for mental particulars too.

## Response 3: Non-Spatial Causation

Some philosophers argue that causation doesn't require spatial relations. Consider:

**Abstract objects**: Numbers, propositions, and mathematical structures arguably enter into causal explanations (consider: "the number of wheels on the vehicle explains why it's called a bicycle"). If abstract objects can be causally relevant without spatial location, Kim's principle is too strong.

**Laws of nature**: Natural laws causally explain physical events. But laws are not spatially located. If laws can be causes (or grounds of causes), not all causation is spatially mediated.

**Temporal but not spatial causation**: Some philosophers argue causation is fundamentally temporal (causes precede effects) rather than spatial. Spatial proximity is a useful heuristic for identifying causes, not a metaphysical requirement.

If any of these succeed, the pairing problem loses force. The dualist can say: mind-body causation is like these other cases—causal relations hold without spatial grounding.

## The Site's Position

This site's [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) framework provides a natural response to the pairing problem: consciousness is spatially located where it causally interfaces with the brain.

If consciousness influences quantum outcomes in specific neural structures (microtubules, synapses, or other quantum-sensitive regions), consciousness is located *where those structures are*. The mind is paired with the body it occupies.

This combines elements of multiple responses:

1. **Spatial location**: Consciousness is in the brain, dissolving the pairing problem directly.

2. **Causal specification**: The pairing relation is the causal interface itself—M1 is paired with B1 because M1 causally affects B1's quantum processes specifically.

3. **Metaphysical distinctness**: Accepting spatial location doesn't reduce mind to matter. A quantum field is spatially located but ontologically distinct from particles; similarly, consciousness can be spatially located but ontologically distinct from neurons.

The quantum framework thus addresses both the causal closure objection (physics has gaps where consciousness acts) and the pairing problem (consciousness is located at those gaps in specific brains).

## Relation to Property Dualism

The pairing problem creates pressure toward [property dualism](/concepts/substance-property-dualism/) rather than substance dualism. If mental properties are properties of brains, they're automatically "paired" with those brains—the question doesn't arise.

But property dualism has its own costs:

1. It makes the persistence of consciousness through physical change harder to explain
2. It leaves personal identity dependent on physical continuity
3. It may collapse into [epiphenomenalism](/arguments/epiphenomenalism/) if the "properties" have no causal powers beyond the physical base

The site remains neutral between substance and property dualism, but the quantum framework works for both. Whether consciousness is a substance located in the brain or a property of brain states, the [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet—consciousness causally affecting quantum outcomes—remains coherent.
