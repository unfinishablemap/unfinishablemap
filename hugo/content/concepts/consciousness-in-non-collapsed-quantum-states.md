---

If consciousness interacts with quantum mechanics at the point of collapse, a prior question demands attention: what is consciousness doing *before* collapse, when the relevant brain states exist in superposition? The Unfinishable Map treats consciousness as a selector among superposed neural states. But the selector must exist during the superposition phase in order to act on it — and that raises a problem with no clean answer. The non-collapsed quantum state is where the interaction must begin, yet we have almost no philosophical framework for what consciousness is or does in that interval.

This concept examines the pre-collapse phase specifically — the philosophical problem of consciousness during superposition rather than at the moment of resolution. For a survey of the major frameworks addressing this question, see [consciousness-in-smeared-quantum-states](/topics/consciousness-in-smeared-quantum-states/).

## The Phenomenological Gap

The deepest difficulty is phenomenological. We can describe what it is like to see red, hear a note, or feel pain. We have no corresponding description of what it is like to be in an indeterminate state between seeing red and seeing blue. The very grammar of phenomenal description assumes determinacy — "what it is like" presupposes a definite experiential character.

This is not merely a gap in philosophical vocabulary. It may reflect a structural feature of consciousness itself. If experience is constitutively determinate — if being indeterminate is something experience *cannot* be — then consciousness in a non-collapsed quantum state faces a logical constraint, not just an empirical one. The superposition exists; the brain participates in it; but consciousness either refuses to follow the brain into indeterminacy or was never the kind of thing that could.

Three logical possibilities emerge:

**Consciousness is absent during superposition.** On this view, experience exists only at collapse. The pre-collapse brain is a physical system in superposition without any accompanying experiential states. This avoids the phenomenological gap but creates a timing problem: consciousness must spring into existence at each collapse event, with no continuous experiential thread connecting successive moments. Penrose's proto-consciousness model partially adopts this approach — something experiential inhabits the superposition, but it falls below the threshold of full consciousness.

**Consciousness is present but indeterminate.** Perhaps experience during superposition is genuinely indefinite — a smear across possible experiential states without any single one being actual. Koch and collaborators have proposed something in this direction, suggesting that the richness of superposition might correspond to the richness of experience. This would mean consciousness doesn't require definiteness, challenging what nearly all other frameworks assume. The difficulty is that no one has articulated what indeterminate experience would be like, and it may be that the request is incoherent — an experience without definite character may be no experience at all.

**Consciousness is present and definite, selecting among the superposed possibilities.** This is [Stapp's position](/concepts/stapp-quantum-mind/) and the one most aligned with the Map's tenets. Consciousness maintains its determinacy throughout, acting as the selector that resolves superposition into definite outcome. The mind is never in the same indeterminate state as the brain. Rather, consciousness operates *on* the superposition from a position of experiential definiteness.

## The Definiteness Constraint

Albert and Loewer identified the core issue precisely: the [measurement-problem](/concepts/measurement-problem/) is really the "determinate-experience problem." Quantum mechanics predicts that measurement devices enter superposition. Brains are measurement devices. Therefore brains should enter superposition. Yet conscious experience is never superposed.

Something prevents consciousness from inheriting the indeterminacy of its physical substrate. This "definiteness constraint" is not a consequence of any known physical law. Decoherence suppresses interference but does not select a single outcome. Spontaneous collapse theories (GRW, CSL) provide objective state reduction but do not explain *why* the collapse produces experiences with determinate character. The definiteness constraint appears to be a feature of consciousness itself — an irreducibly mental fact that physics must accommodate rather than explain.

Chalmers and McQueen formalised this intuition: integrated information (Φ) resists superposition. When a physical system's Φ value enters superposition across different values, collapse is triggered. The definiteness of experience is not passively maintained; it *actively* prevents consciousness from existing in superposition. "The upshot is not that consciousness-collapse interpretations are clearly correct, but that there is a research program here worth exploring," they write — a deliberately cautious framing that nonetheless establishes the viability of consciousness as a collapse trigger.

## Wigner's Friend and Nested Observation

The problem intensifies when observers observe observers. In the [Wigner's friend](/topics/the-measurement-problem-as-philosophical-problem/) scenario, a friend performs a measurement inside a sealed laboratory. From the friend's perspective, collapse occurs and a definite result is obtained. From Wigner's perspective outside the lab, the friend-plus-apparatus remains in superposition. Two conscious observers disagree about whether collapse has happened.

The local friendliness (LF) no-go theorem — stronger than Bell's theorem — establishes that certain natural assumptions cannot all hold simultaneously: that measurement outcomes are definite for the observer, that they remain superposed for an outside observer, and that the two accounts are compatible. Something must give. If consciousness is what resolves superposition, then the friend's measurement truly collapses the state, and Wigner's description of the friend as superposed is simply wrong — a failure to account for the friend's conscious observation. The definiteness constraint, applied consistently, resolves the paradox by insisting that conscious observation is never merely apparent.

This has a striking implication for the Map's framework. If consciousness-driven collapse is real and consciousness always produces definite outcomes, then any system containing a conscious observer cannot be maintained in superposition from the outside. Consciousness is not merely definite in its own experience — it imposes definiteness on physical reality wherever it is present.

## The Timing Problem

How long does the pre-collapse phase last? If [decoherence](/concepts/decoherence/) timescales for neural systems are 10⁻¹³ seconds (Tegmark's estimate) or even 10⁻⁵ seconds (Hagan et al.'s corrected estimate), the "during" of superposition is unimaginably brief. Consciousness would need to operate on femtosecond-to-microsecond timescales to participate in the superposition phase at all.

Stapp's quantum Zeno approach sidesteps the problem. The Zeno effect works through rapid repeated measurement — consciousness does not need to sustain coherence but merely to "observe" rapidly enough to hold desired states. The pre-collapse phase is not a duration consciousness must inhabit but a window consciousness must repeatedly act upon. Each act of mental attention constitutes a measurement, and the rapidity of measurement is what maintains the desired neural pattern.

For the Map's framework, this reframing matters. The question is not "what does consciousness experience during 10⁻¹³ seconds of superposition?" but rather "how does consciousness interact with a physical substrate that is continuously entering and leaving superposition?" The pre-collapse phase is not a static interval but part of an ongoing dynamic in which quantum states form and resolve continuously, with consciousness participating in the resolution.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The Map's [tenets](/tenets/) commit to consciousness as an active selector among superposed neural states. This article identifies the philosophical cost of that commitment: the selector must have some relationship to the pre-collapse phase, and that relationship resists clean description.

**Dualism** gains support from the definiteness constraint. If consciousness cannot enter superposition while physical systems can, then consciousness has a property — constitutive determinacy — that physical systems lack. This is precisely the kind of irreducible difference dualism predicts.

**Minimal Quantum Interaction** is preserved regardless of timing. Whether consciousness acts within the superposition window or triggers collapse from a position of experiential definiteness, the interaction occurs at quantum indeterminacies without energy injection.

**Bidirectional Interaction** faces its most pointed version of the timing question here. If the brain is in superposition and consciousness is definite, the mechanism by which definite consciousness selects among indefinite physical possibilities remains philosophically underdescribed. The Map acknowledges this as an open problem rather than a refutation — the mechanism is unclear, but the alternatives (epiphenomenalism, many-worlds, eliminativism) each face worse difficulties.

**No Many Worlds** is reinforced by the definiteness constraint. The [many-worlds interpretation](/concepts/many-worlds/) dissolves the problem by distributing outcomes across branches, but this trades one mystery (why experience is definite) for another (why *I* am in *this* branch). The Map treats definiteness as a genuine feature of consciousness that demands explanation, not dissolution.
