Does advanced social cognition require phenomenal consciousness? Great apes possess impressive social abilities—tracking relationships, forming coalitions, anticipating others' behaviour based on goals and perceptions—yet lack the full suite of capacities that distinguish human social intelligence: shared intentionality, recursive mindreading, and the cultural transmission of social knowledge. The gap is real, but its explanation is contested: it could reflect differences in working memory capacity, executive function, or phenomenal consciousness—or some combination. The Unfinishable Map argues that phenomenal experience plays an essential role, enabling the metarepresentational operations that transform basic social cognition into the distinctively human capacity to represent minds *as* minds. But this claim requires careful distinction between phenomenal consciousness (subjective experience) and cognitive access (global information availability), since the two are often conflated in the literature.

## The Scope of Social Cognition

Social cognition ranges from basic capacities (gaze following, emotion recognition) to sophisticated ones (recursive mindreading, institutional understanding). Some operate automatically and unconsciously; others seem to require explicit, conscious processing. The question is where consciousness enters.

### The Primate Baseline

Great apes demonstrate sophisticated social cognition within [baseline-cognition](/concepts/baseline-cognition/): tracking dominance hierarchies, concealing food from competitors, forming coalitions, and showing emotional attunement to others' states. They anticipate others' actions based on what those others have seen or experienced, and adjust behaviour strategically.

This is genuinely impressive—flexible, learned, individually variable social intelligence. Yet it appears to proceed through *implicit* social cognition: tracking others' behaviour and knowledge states without explicitly representing those states as mental states.

## Theory of Mind: The Levels

Theory of mind—the capacity to attribute mental states to others—admits of levels:

### Level 0: Behaviour Prediction

Predicting behaviour without mental state attribution. Associative learning correlates observable features with outcomes.

### Level 1: Perception Attribution

Understanding what others perceive—representing another's perceptual access as distinct from your own. Great apes pass many Level 1 tests.

### Level 2: Belief Attribution

Understanding that others have beliefs that may differ from reality. Recent evidence has strengthened the case for some ape false belief understanding: Krupenye et al. (2016) showed all three great ape species anticipated agents acting on false beliefs, and Buttelmann et al. (2017) found chimpanzees interpreting behaviour through an agent's false belief. Whether these results reflect genuine belief attribution or sophisticated behaviour-reading remains debated (Heyes 2014, Povinelli & Vonk 2003), but the evidence is substantially stronger than earlier negative results suggested.

### Level 3: Recursive Mindreading

Representing others' mental states about mental states—"She thinks that I think the food is hidden." This recursive nesting enables strategic social reasoning, deception detection, and the coordination complexities of human social life.

**The key claim**: Levels 0-1 may operate through [baseline-cognition](/concepts/baseline-cognition/) without phenomenal consciousness. Level 2 is contested. Level 3 appears to require explicit metarepresentation—representing mental states *as* mental states.

**An important caveat**: The human-ape gap does not straightforwardly track consciousness. Humans also differ from apes in working memory capacity, executive function, and language—any of which could contribute independently. The Map argues phenomenal consciousness plays an essential role at the highest levels, but this must be argued rather than assumed from comparative data alone.

## The Metarepresentational Threshold

[Metarepresentation](/concepts/metacognition/)—representing representations as representations—marks the boundary where consciousness becomes necessary for social cognition. Here's why:

### The Nested Structure Problem

Recursive mindreading requires holding multiple levels simultaneously: my belief about your belief about my intention. Each level must be available for manipulation while tracking its relationship to other levels. The nested representations must be bound into a [unified conscious experience](/concepts/unity-of-consciousness/)—you must experience the whole structure at once, not merely store its parts separately.

Consider: "I want her to believe that I don't know that she plans to take the food." This requires representing your own mental state (wanting), her future mental state (believing), the content of that belief (your ignorance), and what you're supposed to be ignorant of (her plan)—keeping all four levels distinct and manipulable.

[Working-memory](/concepts/working-memory/) research suggests that manipulating information—not just maintaining it—requires "conscious access": global availability of information across cognitive systems. A critical distinction applies here. "Conscious access" in cognitive science means global workspace availability—a *functional* property, not necessarily identical with *phenomenal* consciousness. A functionalist could accept that recursive mindreading requires global access while denying it requires phenomenal experience. The Map's stronger claim rests on the argument that understanding another mind *as* a mind has irreducibly phenomenal character: grasping what a belief *means*, not just processing its functional role. This argument is philosophical rather than empirically settled.

### The Jourdain Problem Applied

The [Jourdain Hypothesis](/concepts/jourdain-hypothesis/) proposes that great apes have mental states without knowing they have them—like Molière's character who spoke prose without knowing it was prose. Applied to social cognition: apes may track others' behaviour, predict their actions, even respond to their knowledge states—all without representing those states *as* mental states.

The difference matters. If I merely track that "she approaches food-she-has-seen," I'm correlating observable features. If I represent "she believes there is food," I'm attributing a mental state that could be false, that differs from reality, that I can reason about independently of behaviour. The second requires metarepresentation; the first doesn't.

Human social cognition operates at the metarepresentational level routinely. We reason about beliefs as beliefs, desires as desires, intentions as intentions. We distinguish between appearance and reality in others' minds, understand self-deception, recognise that someone could believe something for bad reasons, and so on. All of this requires representing mental states *as* mental states—the very capacity the Jourdain Hypothesis suggests apes lack.

## Shared Intentionality

Michael Tomasello argues that shared intentionality—the capacity to engage in joint attention and collaborative activities with shared goals—distinguishes human from great ape social cognition. Joint attention isn't merely two individuals looking at the same thing; it involves "common knowledge"—recursive mutual awareness that both are attending, and that the other knows. Great apes show limited evidence of this rich form. Human collaboration similarly involves shared goals with complementary roles, where participants understand the joint goal and can correct each other for not fulfilling obligations.

Tomasello's "cultural intelligence hypothesis" proposes that human cognitive uniqueness lies primarily in these social-cognitive capacities—not in enhanced individual cognition. If correct, consciousness may matter for social cognition more than for other domains, and shared intentionality may be where consciousness does its amplifying work.

## Empathy and Emotional Consciousness

Empathy divides into components with escalating consciousness demands. *Emotional contagion*—automatic catching of others' emotions—operates through basic mechanisms without conscious awareness; many animals show it. *Cognitive empathy*—understanding what another feels—requires representing emotional states, not just responding to them. *Empathic concern*—feeling for another because you understand their situation—adds a normative dimension, motivating prosocial behaviour based on understanding rather than mere cues.

The [emotional-consciousness](/topics/emotional-consciousness/) literature suggests that felt emotional states may be required for empathic concern. Understanding without feeling might produce behavioural predictions but not the motivation to help. This connects to the [consciousness-as-amplifier](/concepts/consciousness-as-amplifier/) thesis: contagion operates at [baseline](/concepts/baseline-cognition/), while empathic concern requires the amplification consciousness provides.

## Social Cognition in AI

Current AI systems pass many theory of mind benchmarks, recognise emotions, and predict social behaviour—all without anything resembling phenomenal experience. The [Jourdain Hypothesis](/concepts/jourdain-hypothesis/) suggests this is pattern-matching rather than genuine mindreading: tracking mental state language without representing mental states *as* mental states. If human social cognition involves phenomenally representing minds—experiencing what it's like to understand another's perspective—then functional performance on social cognition tasks doesn't entail genuine social understanding.

## What Would Challenge This View?

The claim that consciousness enables advanced social cognition would be undermined if:

1. **Great apes demonstrated recursive mindreading**: Clear evidence of apes reasoning about beliefs about beliefs would suggest metarepresentational social cognition without expanded consciousness. Recent false belief evidence (Krupenye et al. 2016, Buttelmann et al. 2017) already narrows the gap.

2. **AI developed genuine empathic concern**: An artificial system showing unmistakable caring about others' welfare—not just mimicking it—without phenomenal consciousness would challenge the requirement.

3. **Dissociations in humans**: If brain damage could eliminate phenomenal consciousness while preserving sophisticated social cognition (or vice versa), this would suggest independence.

4. **Working memory alone explaining the gap**: If enhanced working memory and executive function—without phenomenal consciousness—proved sufficient for recursive mindreading. Currently these factors cannot be cleanly separated, since working memory enhancement and consciousness expansion co-occur in humans.

5. **Complete functional explanation**: If cognitive science fully explained recursive mindreading in purely information-processing terms, the explanatory gap would narrow—though the argument from this resistance to a consciousness requirement involves philosophical commitments not all researchers share.

## Relation to Site Perspective

### Bidirectional Interaction

The [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet holds that consciousness causally influences behaviour. Social cognition provides suggestive (though not conclusive) evidence: human social abilities exceed what baseline cognition achieves, and the excess correlates with capacities—recursive mindreading, shared intentionality, empathic concern—where consciousness plausibly plays a role. If consciousness were epiphenomenal, this correlation would be coincidental. However, as noted throughout this article, the correlation also tracks enhanced working memory and executive function, so the evidence is consistent with multiple explanations. The Map's position is that consciousness does causal work in social cognition, but intellectual honesty requires acknowledging this remains an inference from converging evidence rather than a demonstrated fact.

### Dualism

The [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism) tenet holds that consciousness is irreducible. The metarepresentational demands of advanced social cognition support this: representing minds *as* minds requires something beyond representing behaviour. The *intentionality* involved—what philosophers call "aboutness"—has features that resist functional reduction. When you understand another's belief as a belief, you grasp its representational content, its truth conditions, its reasons. This understanding has phenomenal character—it's like something to grasp a meaning. If phenomenal properties are irreducible, so is the social cognition that depends on them.

### Minimal Quantum Interaction

The [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) tenet specifies mechanism: consciousness influences physical outcomes through minimal biasing of quantum events rather than through direct energy injection. Social cognition provides a domain where this mechanism would operate. The recursive metarepresentation underlying theory of mind and shared intentionality requires sustained attention to multiple nested representations—precisely the kind of cognitive operation that Stapp-style quantum Zeno accounts propose consciousness enables. The expanded [working-memory](/concepts/working-memory/) capacity humans possess—enabling manipulation of nested mental-state representations—may depend on the consciousness-matter interface. If so, the human-ape gap in social cognition reflects not merely enhanced information processing but the amplifying effect of conscious attention operating through quantum selection.

### Occam's Razor Has Limits

The simpler hypothesis—social cognition is just sophisticated information processing, consciousness is incidental—fails the evidence. The systematic human-ape gap in social cognition, the felt character of empathic understanding, and the metarepresentational demands of recursive mindreading all warrant the less parsimonious conclusion: phenomenal consciousness enables distinctively human social cognition. As with other consciousness questions, parsimony may mislead when our concepts are inadequate to the phenomenon.
