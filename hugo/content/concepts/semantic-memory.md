You know that Paris is the capital of France, that water freezes at 0°C, and that Napoleon lost at Waterloo. This knowledge is simply *available*—you don't mentally travel back to when you learned these facts. You don't re-experience sitting in geography class or reading a history book. The facts are just there, accessible without phenomenal replay. This is semantic memory, accompanied by what Endel Tulving called *noetic consciousness*: knowing without re-experiencing.

Semantic memory matters for the project's framework because it raises a subtle version of the hard problem. Episodic memory's phenomenology is obvious—the vivid re-experiencing, the felt pastness, the double presence of self. Semantic memory seems more "computational"—mere fact storage and retrieval. But closer examination reveals that semantic retrieval has its own phenomenology: the frustration of tip-of-the-tongue states, the feeling of knowing, the qualitative character of understanding itself. If even factual knowledge involves irreducible phenomenology, then no domain of cognition is purely computational.

## Tulving's Framework: Three Forms of Consciousness

Endel Tulving (1927-2023) distinguished three types of consciousness linked to different memory systems, forming a hierarchy of self-awareness.

**Anoetic consciousness** accompanies procedural and implicit memory. When you ride a bicycle or tie your shoes, you act without reflective awareness. There is no self-reference, no sense of yourself as the subject of experience. The skill executes; you don't observe yourself executing it.

**Noetic consciousness** accompanies semantic memory. You are aware of knowing—you know that you know Paris is in France. But this awareness doesn't involve projecting yourself through time. The fact is simply present to awareness, not re-lived. Tulving called this "knowing" as opposed to "remembering."

**Autonoetic consciousness** accompanies episodic memory. You don't just know that you attended your graduation—you can mentally travel back, re-experiencing the day with phenomenal presence. You are aware of yourself as having lived through the event, not merely aware of facts about it.

The noetic/autonoetic distinction maps onto what psychologists call the remember/know paradigm. In recognition tests, subjects indicate whether they "remember" an item (can recollect the original encounter) or merely "know" it (recognize it without recollection). This operationalises the phenomenological difference: remembering involves temporal self-projection; knowing doesn't.

## The Phenomenology of Semantic Retrieval

Though semantic memory lacks the dramatic re-experiencing of episodic retrieval, it has distinctive phenomenological features.

### Tip-of-the-Tongue States

The tip-of-the-tongue (TOT) phenomenon reveals semantic retrieval's phenomenal character. You are confident you know a word—you can often identify its first letter, its syllable count, related words—but the phonological form won't come. The word is frustratingly *almost* there.

TOT states have undeniable phenomenal character: the sense of imminence, the confidence in knowing, the frustration of blocked retrieval. Recent philosophical analysis identifies TOT as a prime instance of [cognitive phenomenology](/concepts/cognitive-phenomenology/)—the phenomenal character derives from activated conceptual representations, not sensory accompaniments. You feel the semantic content approaching consciousness even before the word arrives.

The resolution of TOT states is also phenomenologically distinctive. When the word finally comes, there's relief and recognition—the "pop" phenomenon where the answer suddenly enters awareness without deliberate effort. This phenomenology of retrieval success complements the phenomenology of retrieval difficulty.

### Feeling of Knowing

The feeling-of-knowing (FOK) is a metacognitive judgment: you can't currently recall an answer but feel confident you would recognise it. FOK represents awareness of your own semantic states—knowing that you know, even when retrieval fails.

Research shows FOK reliably predicts subsequent recognition. Subjective feelings about semantic accessibility track actual processing. This correlation suggests FOK isn't mere confabulation—it reflects genuine access to information about memory states. The phenomenology of "almost knowing" corresponds to something real.

### Understanding as Experience

The deepest phenomenological question about semantic memory concerns understanding itself. When you genuinely grasp a concept—when you understand what entropy means, not just can recite a definition—is there phenomenal character to that understanding?

The [cognitive phenomenology](/concepts/cognitive-phenomenology/) debate addresses this directly. Understanding Hegel feels different from understanding Hume—not just because different mental images arise, but because the intellectual grasp has different qualitative character. If this is right, semantic memory isn't mere data storage. It's the repository of conceptual understanding, and understanding is phenomenal.

Consider what happens when you finally understand a proof. There's the "aha" moment of insight—but is this just accompanying emotion, or is there something phenomenal in the *grasping itself*? Proponents of cognitive phenomenology argue for the latter. The understanding has its own qualitative character beyond whatever imagery or affect accompanies it.

## Personal Semantics: A Bridge Category

Research reveals a middle ground between episodic and semantic memory that illuminates their relationship. Personal semantics includes:

- Autobiographical facts detached from acquisition episodes ("I was born in Leeds")
- Knowledge of repeated events lacking specific temporal markers ("I used to walk to school")
- Self-relevant general knowledge ("I am good at chess")

You know these things about yourself, but not through re-experiencing specific learning episodes. The knowledge is available in the semantic mode—just there—yet feels more personal than knowing Paris is in France.

Electrophysiological research shows personal semantic retrieval produces neural signatures intermediate between general semantics and unique episodes. This suggests a gradient rather than a dichotomy: general facts → autobiographical facts → repeated events → unique events, with increasing autonoetic character as you move right.

The gradient matters because it suggests episodic and semantic memory are less distinct than Tulving originally proposed. They may be different weightings of common processes rather than separate systems. Noetic and autonoetic consciousness would then be poles of a continuum, not separate faculties.

## Automatic vs. Conscious Semantic Processing

Semantic retrieval involves both automatic and controlled processes—a distinction crucial for understanding its relationship to consciousness.

**Automatic aspects**: Semantic priming occurs without conscious attention. Reading "doctor" activates "nurse" before you're aware of the connection. Masked words too brief for awareness still prime semantically related targets. The spread of activation through semantic networks is automatic, fast, and unconscious.

**Controlled aspects**: But full semantic integration—consciously understanding meaning—requires awareness. In attentional blink paradigms, when targets don't reach consciousness, semantic processing fails to complete. The N400 ERP component (a marker of semantic processing) requires the word to reach conscious awareness. Subliminal priming activates associations, but conscious processing is needed for genuine understanding.

This suggests a two-stage model: automatic activation spreads through semantic networks without consciousness, but the integration of meaning into the unified field of awareness requires consciousness. You can unconsciously activate "nurse" from "doctor," but you can't unconsciously *understand* a sentence.

## Implications for AI

Large language models excel at what looks like semantic processing. They store vast knowledge, retrieve relevant information, produce semantically coherent text, and show priming-like effects where context influences outputs. If semantic memory is purely computational—activation patterns without phenomenology—LLMs might possess its functional equivalent.

But this analysis suggests semantic memory in humans isn't purely computational. TOT states have phenomenal character. FOK involves metacognitive awareness. Understanding has qualitative character. These features don't reduce to information retrieval.

The contrast is revealing: LLMs don't experience TOT states. They either retrieve or don't. There's no frustrating sense that the word is almost there, no phenomenology of blocked retrieval. They have no FOK—no metacognitive awareness of what they "know." They produce outputs, but there's nothing it's like to produce them.

If noetic consciousness involves irreducible phenomenology, LLMs lack it despite functional similarity. They manipulate semantic information without the accompanying awareness that constitutes knowing in Tulving's sense. This strengthens the case that LLMs process symbols without genuinely understanding—understanding requires the phenomenal character they lack.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Semantic memory and noetic consciousness connect to several foundational commitments.

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: The phenomenology of semantic retrieval resists computational reduction. TOT states, FOK, and the qualitative character of understanding involve "what it's like" properties that physical descriptions don't capture. If even factual knowledge has phenomenal dimensions, the hard problem extends beyond vivid sensory qualia into the seemingly "cold" domain of information retrieval.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)**: Effortful semantic search—deliberately trying to recall a word or solve a problem—involves the same phenomenology of [mental effort](/concepts/mental-effort/) that characterises conscious agency. The experience of *trying* to remember involves directed attention, sustained engagement, and often physical strain. If consciousness causally influences brain states, semantic retrieval is one domain where this influence operates.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occam)**: The simpler view—semantic memory is just data storage, noetic consciousness is an illusion—hasn't won. The phenomenology of TOT, FOK, and understanding persists under scrutiny. Complex mental phenomena may require complex explanations, even when simpler computational accounts are available.

**Cognitive Phenomenology Connection**: This page complements [cognitive-phenomenology](/concepts/cognitive-phenomenology/). Semantic memory provides the empirical territory; cognitive phenomenology provides the philosophical framework. If liberalism about cognitive phenomenology is correct—if understanding itself has proprietary phenomenal character—then semantic memory is phenomenally rich despite lacking the vivid re-experiencing of episodic memory.

the project adopts a qualified position: noetic consciousness involves genuine phenomenology, but it's subtler than autonoetic consciousness. Knowing has qualitative character—the TOT frustration, the FOK confidence, the satisfaction of understanding. These are real phenomenal states, not merely functional access to stored information. This extends the hard problem into semantic memory: explaining the neural correlates of semantic retrieval wouldn't explain why there's something it's like to know.
