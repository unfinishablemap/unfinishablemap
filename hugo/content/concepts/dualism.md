Dualism holds that reality contains more than just physical matter—consciousness or mind is something distinct that cannot be fully explained by physics. As a position within [philosophy of mind](/concepts/philosophy-of-mind/), dualism is the first of The Unfinishable Map's [five foundational commitments](/tenets/#dualism). The position is supported by multiple independent arguments: the [explanatory-gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/) between physical description and subjective experience, the conceivability of [philosophical-zombies](/concepts/philosophical-zombies/), the [knowledge argument](/concepts/knowledge-argument/) (Mary's Room), and the intrinsic character of [qualia](/concepts/qualia/). These arguments converge on a single conclusion: consciousness has features that physical description cannot capture.

## What Dualism Claims

At its core, dualism asserts an ontological distinction between mind and matter. Physical science describes mass, charge, spatial relations, causal interactions—the furniture of the physical world. But when we ask *what it is like* to see red, feel pain, or taste coffee, we encounter something different: the qualitative, subjective character of experience.

Dualism holds that this subjective dimension is not just epistemically distinct (a different *way of knowing*) but ontologically distinct (a different *kind of thing*). No amount of physical information—no matter how complete—entails or explains the existence and nature of conscious experience.

The claim is negative and positive. Negatively: consciousness is not reducible to physics. Positively: there is something real beyond the physical that must be acknowledged in any complete account of reality.

## The Main Varieties

Dualism comes in two main forms, distinguished by their ontological commitments (see [substance-property-dualism](/concepts/substance-property-dualism/) for detailed treatment):

### Substance Dualism

Substance dualism holds that mind and body are different *kinds of thing*—distinct substances. This is the Cartesian view: res cogitans (thinking substance) and res extensa (extended substance) are fundamentally different. Minds are genuine additions to the world's inventory, over and above physical objects.

Modern substance dualists (E.J. Lowe, Dean Zimmerman) accept that mental substances are part of the natural world while maintaining their distinctness from physical matter. One consideration favouring substance dualism involves the subject combination problem: property dualism (especially in panpsychist versions) struggles to explain how micro-experiences combine into unified macro-subjects, while substance dualism posits unified subjects from the start.

### Property Dualism

Property dualism holds that mental properties are genuinely different from physical properties without positing separate mental substances. Physical objects (brains, neurons) have two kinds of properties: physical properties (mass, charge, spatial location) and phenomenal properties ([qualia](/concepts/qualia/)). The properties are irreducible, but there is only one kind of object.

This includes positions like naturalistic dualism (Chalmers's early view), where phenomenal properties are fundamental features of nature that arise from physical complexity but don't reduce to physics.

### Which Matters for the Map

The Map's [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism) tenet is compatible with either formulation. What matters is the irreducibility claim: consciousness cannot be identified with or derived from physical processes. Both substance and property dualism deliver this. The downstream commitments—[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) and [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)—work with either ontological framework.

## Arguments for Dualism

Multiple independent arguments support the dualist conclusion. Their convergence is significant—different starting points reach the same destination.

### The Explanatory Gap

Joseph Levine's [explanatory-gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/) identifies a structural problem: physical explanations describe how parts relate and systems behave, but subjective experience has qualitative, intrinsic character. No relational or dispositional description entails what red *looks like*. The gap isn't epistemic (we just don't know enough) but conceptual—the kinds of concepts physical science employs (structural, functional, relational) cannot in principle capture subjective character. This isn't a matter of needing better equations or more complete neuroscience. The concepts are of different types: physical description characterizes structure and behavior, while phenomenal reality has intrinsic qualitative character.

[Leibniz's Mill](/topics/leibnizs-mill-argument/) dramatises this gap. Walking through an enlarged brain, we would find only mechanical parts—neurons, chemicals, electrical signals—but never perception itself. The argument anticipated modern discussions of the explanatory gap by nearly three centuries.

### The Conceivability Argument

We can coherently conceive of [philosophical-zombies](/concepts/philosophical-zombies/)—beings physically identical to us but lacking conscious experience. Unlike scientific identities (water = H₂O), phenomenal concepts give us direct access to their referents. When we conceive of zombies, we don't merely *describe* a scenario—we positively grasp a world where all physical facts obtain and phenomenal facts do not.

If zombies are conceivable, they are metaphysically possible. If they are possible, consciousness is not necessitated by physical facts.

Some philosophers (notably Dennett) argue zombies are actually inconceivable—that once we fully specify all physical and functional details, consciousness is thereby specified. But this response assumes what it needs to prove: that functional/physical specification exhausts what needs specifying. The zombie argument's force comes from our ability to grasp—not just describe—the qualitative difference between experience and its absence while holding all functional facts fixed.

### The Knowledge Argument

Mary knows all physical facts about colour vision while living in a black-and-white room. When Mary sees red for the first time, she learns something new—what red looks like. This new knowledge is not deducible from physical facts. Frank Jackson's [knowledge-argument](/concepts/knowledge-argument/) targets physicalism directly: if all facts are physical, complete physical knowledge should yield all facts. Mary's surprise shows it doesn't.

### The Intrinsic Character of Qualia

[Qualia](/concepts/qualia/) have intrinsic character—what pain feels like, how red appears—that physical descriptions cannot capture. Physics describes relations between quantities (mass relative to other masses, charge interactions, spatial relations). But the redness of red is not a relation. It is an intrinsic quality present in experience. No amount of relational information yields intrinsic character.

### The Argument from Reason

The [argument-from-reason](/topics/argument-from-reason/) targets physicalism from a different angle than phenomenal arguments—it concerns rationality rather than qualia. If physicalism is true, all beliefs (including belief in physicalism) are fully explained by nonrational physical causes: neurons firing due to electrochemical gradients rather than logical relationships. But rational inference requires tracking normative relationships—what follows from what, what counts as good evidence. Physical causation operates via efficient causes that cannot instantiate normativity.

The self-defeat structure is decisive: if the argument succeeds, physicalism cannot be rationally believed, since the very rational justification required to accept it would be undermined. This provides support for dualism that doesn't depend on contested intuitions about consciousness—it targets the conditions for rational thought itself. The argument complements the phenomenal case by showing that consciousness must involve irreducible normative properties enabling genuine reasoning, not merely neural activity that happens to correlate with logical truths.

For comprehensive treatment, see [the-case-for-dualism](/concepts/the-case-for-dualism/).

## Dualism and Interaction

A crucial question for dualism: if mind and matter are distinct, how do they relate? Three main answers:

**[Interactionism](/concepts/interactionist-dualism/)**: Mind and body causally interact. Consciousness influences physical outcomes, and physical events influence consciousness. This is the Map's position, specified in the [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet.

**[epiphenomenalism](/concepts/epiphenomenalism/)**: Body affects mind, but not vice versa. Consciousness is real but causally inert—along for the ride but not influencing outcomes. The Map rejects this because it is self-undermining: if consciousness causes nothing, we cannot trust our reports about consciousness.

**Parallelism**: Mind and body don't interact at all—they run in parallel without causal connection. This faces similar problems to epiphenomenalism and adds unexplained coordination.

The Map's framework commits to interactionism, with the [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) tenet specifying where and how: at quantum indeterminacies, consciousness biases otherwise undetermined outcomes without violating conservation laws.

## Objections to Dualism

### The Interaction Problem

If mind is non-physical, how can it causally affect the physical world? Classical objections (Princess Elizabeth to Descartes, Leibniz on conservation laws) seemed devastating when physics was deterministic. But quantum mechanics reopens possibilities: at quantum indeterminacies, physics specifies probabilities, not outcomes. Consciousness could select among possibilities without injecting energy. The [history-of-interactionist-dualism](/topics/history-of-interactionist-dualism/) traces how these objections evolved and why they no longer rule out interaction.

The leading candidate mechanism is [Stapp's quantum Zeno effect](/concepts/stapp-quantum-mind/): repeated attention-driven observations bias superposition collapse toward particular outcomes without adding energy, only information. The objection that warm, noisy brains can't maintain quantum coherence misunderstands the proposal—consciousness doesn't require long-lived neural superposition. Stapp's model concerns synaptic vesicle release, where quantum uncertainty in neurotransmitter timing provides the interface point, not macroscopic brain-wide coherence. See [objections-to-interactionism](/concepts/objections-to-interactionism/) for detailed treatment.

### The Parsimony Objection

Isn't materialism simpler? Why posit two kinds of thing when one might suffice? the Map's [Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits) tenet addresses this: parsimony is unreliable when concepts are inadequate. Materialism is "simpler" only if it explains what needs explaining. A theory that explains mechanisms but not experience achieves economy by ignoring the phenomenon.

### The Neural Correlation Objection

Doesn't neuroscience show that consciousness is just brain activity? Every mental state correlates with brain states. Drugs and damage alter experience predictably. But correlation is compatible with dualism. [Interactionism](/concepts/interactionist-dualism/) predicts exactly these findings—if consciousness interfaces with the brain, we would expect tight correlations. The correlations show where consciousness interfaces with matter, not that consciousness is matter.

### The Cognitive Science Objection

Paul Bloom argued humans are "natural-born dualists" due to separate cognitive systems for physics and psychology—implying dualism is a cognitive bias to be outgrown. But Barrett et al.'s 2021 cross-cultural study found most people actually default to intuitive *materialism*, expecting mental states to cease at death. The cognitive science is contested, and more fundamentally, cognitive naturalness doesn't determine truth. See [intuitive-dualism](/concepts/intuitive-dualism/) for the full debate.

### The Eliminativist Challenge

A more radical objection: perhaps "consciousness" and "subjective experience" don't refer to anything real—they're confused folk categories like "élan vital" destined for elimination as neuroscience advances. If phenomenal concepts are malformed, zombie and knowledge arguments collapse.

But this strategy is self-undermining in a way eliminative materialism about other entities is not. We might discover that "witches don't exist" because the concept is incoherent. But we cannot coherently discover that "experiences don't exist"—the discovery would itself be an experience. As Searle noted, consciousness has a first-person ontology that makes elimination impossible. We can revise our *theories* about consciousness, but we cannot deny the phenomenon whose existence is given immediately in awareness.

## Relation to the Map's Perspective

Dualism is the Map's first foundational commitment—the [Dualism tenet](/tenets/#dualism) states that consciousness is not reducible to physical processes.

This commitment is not arbitrary but grounded in the convergence of arguments: the explanatory gap, conceivability arguments, the knowledge argument, and the intrinsic character of qualia all point the same direction. [materialism](/concepts/materialism/) in all its forms—reductive physicalism, functionalism, eliminativism—fails to bridge the gap between physical description and subjective experience.

Combined with the [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet, the Map holds [interactionist-dualism](/concepts/interactionist-dualism/)—consciousness is distinct *and* causally efficacious. The [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) tenet specifies the interface: quantum indeterminacies where physics leaves outcomes undetermined. This combination preserves what matters for human agency and moral responsibility—our choices genuinely influence outcomes, not just in appearance but in reality.

This framework is not a retreat to mystery. The interaction has a candidate mechanism ([Stapp's quantum Zeno effect](/concepts/stapp-quantum-mind/)). The empirical findings (neural correlates, the efficacy of attention, voluntary action) are predicted and explained. The position is coherent, parsimonious where parsimony matters (not positing unobserved forces), and takes seriously the one thing we know most directly: our own conscious experience.

What would count as evidence against dualism? If future neuroscience provided a structural account of subjective character—explaining not just neural correlates but *why* particular brain states feel the way they do—the explanatory gap would close. If zombie scenarios turned out conceptually incoherent under analysis, conceivability arguments would fail. If all apparent voluntary action could be predicted from prior physical states with no indeterminacy, interactionist dualism would lose its interface. The position is empirically vulnerable, not metaphysically protected.
