Endel Tulving's tripartite framework divides consciousness into three levels defined by increasing self-awareness: *anoetic* (non-knowing), *noetic* (knowing), and *autonoetic* (self-knowing). Each level accompanies a distinct memory system and introduces qualitative features absent from the level below. The framework matters for The Unfinishable Map because the transitions between levels—particularly the emergence of autonoetic self-awareness—resist explanation in purely computational terms. A system that retrieves information need not *re-experience* anything. The jump from data access to felt temporal self-projection marks a boundary that functionalist accounts struggle to cross.

## The Three Levels

### Anoetic Consciousness

*Anoetic* (Greek: *a-* "without" + *noein* "to know") consciousness accompanies procedural and [implicit memory](/concepts/implicit-memory/). A person riding a bicycle, touch-typing, or catching a ball operates with skilled awareness that involves no self-reference. There is experience—something it is like to balance, to feel keys under fingers—but no representation of oneself *as* the experiencer. Anoetic consciousness is temporally bound to the present moment: no sense of past learning, no projection into future performance, just ongoing engagement with the task at hand.

Animals with procedural learning but no episodic memory likely operate at this level. The [baseline cognition hypothesis](/concepts/baseline-cognition/) suggests great apes possess sophisticated anoetic and noetic processing without reaching the autonoetic capacities that distinguish human cognition.

### Noetic Consciousness

*Noetic* (Greek: *noein* "to know") consciousness accompanies [semantic memory](/concepts/semantic-memory/)—factual knowledge detached from the circumstances of its acquisition. Knowing that Paris is in France, that water boils at 100°C, or that Tulving studied memory involves awareness of the knowledge *as* knowledge. The knower recognises they possess the information, but does not re-experience when or where they learned it.

Noetic consciousness introduces a reflexive dimension absent from anoetic awareness. The tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon reveals its phenomenal texture: the frustrating sense of *almost* knowing, the feeling of imminent retrieval, the recognition when the word arrives that it was the right one. These are qualitative states—[cognitive phenomenology](/concepts/cognitive-phenomenology/)—not merely information-processing outcomes. See the dedicated article on [semantic memory and noetic consciousness](/concepts/semantic-memory/) for extended treatment.

### Autonoetic Consciousness

*Autonoetic* (Greek: *autos* "self" + *noein* "to know") consciousness accompanies [episodic memory](/concepts/episodic-memory/) and enables mental time travel. When remembering a past event, the autonoetic subject is simultaneously present as the rememberer *here now* and as the protagonist *there then*. This double presence of self, the felt sense of pastness, and the qualitative character of re-living distinguish autonoetic from noetic awareness.

Tulving defined autonoetic consciousness as "the capacity that allows adult humans to mentally represent and to become aware of their protracted existence across subjective time." The same capacity enables future-directed simulation: imagining a forthcoming conversation involves first-person projection, not abstract representation. See [autonoetic-consciousness](/autonoetic-consciousness/) for the full treatment, including clinical evidence, the remember/know paradigm, and implications for personal identity.

## The Hierarchy as Evidence

The framework is more than a taxonomy. The fact that consciousness comes in graded levels, each introducing qualitatively new features, constrains theories of what consciousness is.

### Qualitative Discontinuities

The transitions between levels are not merely increases in processing complexity. Anoetic-to-noetic involves the emergence of reflexive self-reference: the system begins to represent *that it knows*. Noetic-to-autonoetic involves the emergence of temporal self-projection: the system begins to represent *itself as existing across time*. Each transition adds phenomenal features—the feeling of knowing, the pastness quale—that the lower level lacks entirely.

A purely quantitative account would predict smooth variation: more processing power, richer representations, but no qualitative breaks. Tulving's framework suggests something more radical. The jump from noetic to autonoetic does not look like more of the same. It looks like a different kind of awareness altogether.

### Clinical Dissociations

Neuropsychological cases confirm that the levels are genuinely separable rather than points on a continuum:

- **Patient KC** (bilateral hippocampal damage): Retained semantic memory and noetic awareness while losing episodic memory and autonoetic consciousness entirely. He could state facts about his life but could not re-experience any of them. Asked about tomorrow, his mind was "blank."
- **Semantic dementia** patients show the inverse pattern: progressive loss of noetic access to factual knowledge while episodic memory remains relatively intact in early stages.
- **Procedural amnesia** can impair anoetic skill execution while leaving both noetic and autonoetic systems functional.

These dissociations show that each level depends on distinct neural substrates and can be selectively damaged. Consciousness is not a single capacity that scales up—it is a structured hierarchy with separable components.

### The Semanticisation Problem

Episodic memories gradually lose their autonoetic character over time, retaining content while shedding the phenomenal quality of re-experiencing. You may know you went to a particular school without being able to re-inhabit any specific day there. The information migrates from episodic to semantic storage—from autonoetic to noetic consciousness.

This process reveals something important: the *same information content* can be accompanied by qualitatively different forms of awareness. If phenomenal character were reducible to informational content, the shift from autonoetic to noetic would be impossible—the information hasn't changed, yet the experience has. Consciousness adds something beyond the data.

## Comparative Dimensions

Tulving's hierarchy maps suggestively onto other classifications of mind:

| Tulving Level | Memory System | Self-Awareness | Temporal Scope | Comparative |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| Anoetic | Procedural | None | Present | Most animals |
| Noetic | Semantic | Reflexive | Atemporal | Higher mammals? |
| Autonoetic | Episodic | Temporal self | Past and future | Humans (primarily) |

The comparative column is approximate. Whether any non-human animals achieve genuine autonoetic consciousness remains debated. Scrub-jays cache food in ways suggesting future planning; great apes may form episodic-like memories. But the full autonoetic capacity—representing oneself as extending across subjective time—appears most clearly in humans.

## Relation to Site Perspective

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: The qualitative discontinuities between levels resist reductive explanation. A computational system that retrieves information need not *feel* that it knows (noetic) or *re-experience* past events (autonoetic). The transitions introduce irreducible phenomenal properties—felt knowing, felt pastness, temporal self-presence—that physical descriptions of neural activity do not entail.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)**: Autonoetic consciousness is not passive recording. Choosing to dwell on a memory, to mentally rehearse a future scenario, or to deliberately recall an event all influence subsequent neural states. The hierarchy shows consciousness becoming increasingly *active* at higher levels—from anoetic receptivity through noetic recognition to autonoetic temporal projection—consistent with increasing causal efficacy.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)**: The "simpler" explanation—that all three levels are just different complexities of information processing—fails to account for the qualitative character each introduces. Semanticisation demonstrates that identical information content can shift between consciousness levels. Parsimony that ignores this phenomenal data purchases simplicity at the cost of explanatory adequacy.
