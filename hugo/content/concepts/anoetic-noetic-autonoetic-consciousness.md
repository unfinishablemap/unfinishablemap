Endel Tulving's tripartite framework divides consciousness into three levels defined by increasing self-awareness: *anoetic* (non-knowing), *noetic* (knowing), and *autonoetic* (self-knowing). Each level accompanies a distinct memory system and introduces qualitative features absent from the level below. The framework matters for The Unfinishable Map because the transitions between levels—particularly the emergence of autonoetic self-awareness—resist explanation in purely computational terms. A system that retrieves information need not *re-experience* anything. The jump from data access to felt temporal self-projection marks a boundary that functionalist accounts struggle to cross.

## The Three Levels

### Anoetic Consciousness

*Anoetic* (Greek: *a-* "without" + *noein* "to know") consciousness accompanies procedural and [implicit memory](/concepts/implicit-memory/). A person riding a bicycle, touch-typing, or catching a ball operates with skilled awareness that involves no self-reference. There is experience—something it is like to balance, to feel keys under fingers—but no representation of oneself *as* the experiencer. Tulving emphasised that anoetic consciousness is not *absent* consciousness but a distinct mode: what he called "non-reflective [qualia](/concepts/qualia/)." These are genuine phenomenal states, temporally bound to the present moment, with no sense of past learning or projection into future performance.

Animals with procedural learning but no episodic memory likely operate at this level (Tulving, 1985). The [baseline cognition hypothesis](/concepts/baseline-cognition/) suggests great apes possess sophisticated anoetic and noetic processing without reaching the autonoetic capacities that distinguish human cognition.

### Noetic Consciousness

*Noetic* (Greek: *noein* "to know") consciousness accompanies [semantic memory](/concepts/semantic-memory/)—factual knowledge detached from the circumstances of its acquisition. Knowing that Paris is in France or that Tulving studied memory involves awareness of the knowledge *as* knowledge. The knower recognises they possess the information, but does not re-experience when or where they learned it.

Noetic consciousness introduces a reflexive dimension absent from anoetic awareness. The tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon reveals its phenomenal texture: the frustrating sense of *almost* knowing, the feeling of imminent retrieval, the recognition when the word arrives that it was the right one. These are qualitative states—[cognitive phenomenology](/concepts/cognitive-phenomenology/)—not merely information-processing outcomes.

### Autonoetic Consciousness

*Autonoetic* (Greek: *autos* "self" + *noein* "to know") consciousness accompanies [episodic memory](/concepts/episodic-memory/) and enables mental time travel. When remembering a past event, the autonoetic subject is simultaneously present as the rememberer *here now* and as the protagonist *there then*. This double presence of self, the felt sense of pastness, and the qualitative character of re-living distinguish autonoetic from noetic awareness.

Wheeler, Stuss, and Tulving (1997) defined autonoetic consciousness as "the capacity that allows adult humans to mentally represent and to become aware of their protracted existence across time." The *remember/know* paradigm operationalises this distinction: subjects who "remember" an item re-experience its encoding context (autonoetic), while those who "know" it recognise it without re-experiencing (noetic)—same information, different [phenomenal](/concepts/phenomenal-consciousness/) accompaniment.

## The Constitutive-Contingent Debate

The central philosophical question about autonoesis is whether it is *constitutive* of [episodic memory](/concepts/episodic-memory/)—its defining phenomenological feature—or merely a contingent accompaniment of retrieval. This debate is the [hard problem](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/) in miniature: it asks whether the felt quality of re-experiencing can be explained away functionally, or whether it points to something irreducible about consciousness.

The orthodox position, defended by Tulving and developed by Klein (2016), holds that autonoetic consciousness *defines* episodic memory. Strip away the felt sense of re-experiencing, and what remains is factual knowledge about the past—semantic memory in biographical costume. Klein sharpened the argument by separating *content* from *manner of experiencing*: the same proposition ("I visited Rome in 2019") can be accompanied by autonoetic re-experiencing or by bare noetic recognition. The phenomenal difference does not reduce to an informational difference.

De Brigard (2024) mounted a significant challenge, arguing that autonoetic consciousness lacks construct validity and is not necessary for episodic memory. He proposes characterising episodic memory functionally, treating phenomenology as a contingent feature—present in typical cases but dispensable in principle.

The Map treats this deflationary move as structurally parallel to illusionism about [qualia](/concepts/qualia/). Just as illusionists dissolve the hard problem by denying that phenomenal consciousness is what it seems, the contingentist reclassifies re-experiencing as non-essential—deflating the explanatory target rather than explaining it.

## Three Philosophical Frameworks

Sant'Anna, Michaelian, and Andonovski (2024) mapped three frameworks for understanding what autonoesis *is*: **representational accounts** ground it in the format of memory representations (explaining the *immediacy* of re-experiencing but not its *source*); **metacognitive accounts** explain it through monitoring processes during retrieval (capturing its *source* but missing its *immediacy*); and **epistemic accounts** treat it as the felt character of a persisting relation to a past event (capturing immediacy but, again, leaving the source of [phenomenal character](/concepts/phenomenal-consciousness/) unexplained).

The incompleteness of each framework is philosophically telling. No purely functional or representational approach fully captures what autonoetic experience *is like*. The immediacy-source tension—where each framework explains one dimension but fails on the other—mirrors the broader [explanatory-gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/) between functional description and phenomenal character.

## The Hierarchy as Evidence

### Qualitative Discontinuities

The transitions between levels are not merely increases in processing complexity. Anoetic-to-noetic involves the emergence of reflexive self-reference: the system begins to represent *that it knows*. Noetic-to-autonoetic involves the emergence of temporal self-projection: the system begins to represent *itself as existing across time*. Each transition adds phenomenal features—the feeling of knowing, the pastness quale—that the lower level lacks entirely.

A physicalist might point to phase transitions—water becoming ice—as precedent for qualitative discontinuities emerging from quantitative physical changes. But phase transitions involve third-person structural properties: crystalline lattice formation, viscosity changes, density shifts—observable, measurable, and fully derivable from molecular dynamics. The consciousness transitions in Tulving's hierarchy introduce first-person phenomenal properties. The jump from noetic to autonoetic is not a change in what the system *does* but in what the system *is like*. No amount of structural description entails that a system processing temporal self-representations should *feel like* anything at all.

### Clinical Dissociations

Neuropsychological cases confirm that the levels are genuinely separable:

- **Patient KC** (extensive bilateral brain damage): Retained semantic memory and noetic awareness while losing episodic memory and autonoetic consciousness entirely. He could state facts about his life but could not re-experience any of them. Asked about tomorrow, his mind was "blank" (Tulving, 2002).
- **Semantic dementia** patients show the inverse: progressive loss of noetic access to factual knowledge while episodic memory remains relatively intact in early stages.
- **Basal ganglia disorders** (Huntington's, Parkinson's) can impair procedural learning and anoetic skill execution while leaving noetic and autonoetic systems intact.

These dissociations show that each level depends on distinct neural substrates and can be selectively damaged. Consciousness is not a single capacity that scales up—it is a structured hierarchy with separable components.

### The Semanticisation Problem

Episodic memories gradually lose their autonoetic character, retaining content while shedding the phenomenal quality of re-experiencing. You may know you went to a particular school without being able to re-inhabit any specific day there. The information migrates from episodic to semantic storage—from autonoetic to noetic consciousness.

This reveals that the *same propositional content* can be accompanied by qualitatively different forms of awareness. The remember/know paradigm confirms this experimentally: subjects encounter the same item and either "remember" it (with autonoetic re-experiencing) or "know" it (with noetic recognition), demonstrating that phenomenal character varies independently of informational content. [Consciousness](/concepts/consciousness/) adds something beyond the data.

## Autonoesis and Causal Efficacy

Klein (2016) argued that autonoetic consciousness—not episodic memory content—drives future-oriented cognition. His evolutionary analysis reframes memory's purpose: "Memory has been designed by natural selection not to relive the past, but rather to anticipate and plan for future contingencies." The felt quality of temporal self-projection is not decorative; it is the mechanism through which past experience shapes future behaviour.

This bears on epiphenomenalism. Klein's content/manner distinction shows that the same informational content, present in both noetic and autonoetic modes, yields different functional outcomes depending on *how it is experienced*. The manner of experiencing—not the information alone—determines what the agent can do with the memory. The [baseline cognition hypothesis](/concepts/baseline-cognition/) reinforces this: great apes demonstrate sophisticated cognition but cannot perform counterfactual reasoning or cumulative culture. If autonoetic consciousness explains this cognitive gap, it is doing real causal work—not merely accompanying processes that would proceed identically without it.

## Comparative Dimensions

| Tulving Level | Memory System | Self-Awareness | Temporal Scope | Comparative |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| Anoetic | Procedural | Pre-reflective | Present | Most animals |
| Noetic | Semantic | Reflexive | Atemporal | Higher mammals? |
| Autonoetic | Episodic | Temporal self | Past and future | Humans (primarily) |

Whether any non-human animals achieve genuine autonoetic consciousness remains debated. Scrub-jays cache food in ways suggesting future planning (Clayton & Dickinson, 1998); great apes may form episodic-like memories. The difficulty of settling this question from the outside illustrates a deeper point: third-person observation cannot determine whether behaviour involves felt temporal self-projection or merely sophisticated future-oriented processing.

## Relation to Site Perspective

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: The qualitative discontinuities between levels resist reductive explanation. The transitions introduce irreducible phenomenal properties—felt knowing, felt pastness, temporal self-presence—that physical descriptions of neural activity do not entail. The constitutive-contingent debate directly instantiates the broader question: if autonoetic awareness defines episodic memory, then a functionally identical system lacking the felt quality of re-experiencing would not have episodic memory at all.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)**: Klein's argument that autonoetic consciousness is the "causally determinative factor" in future self-projection supports the Map's commitment to [mental causation](/concepts/mental-causation/). The hierarchy shows consciousness becoming increasingly *active* at higher levels—from anoetic receptivity through noetic recognition to autonoetic temporal projection—consistent with increasing causal efficacy.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)**: Autonoetic consciousness presupposes a determinate personal history and a singular future self. Many-worlds fragmentation—where every quantum event spawns branching versions of the subject—undermines the indexical "I" that autonoetic experience requires. If every plan is executed by countless branching copies, the felt urgency of deliberation loses its rational basis.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)**: The "simpler" explanation—that all three levels are just different complexities of information processing—fails to account for the qualitative character each introduces. Semanticisation demonstrates that identical propositional content can shift between consciousness levels. Parsimony that ignores phenomenal data purchases simplicity at the cost of explanatory adequacy.

## What Would Challenge This View?

- **Computational mental time travel**: A system that demonstrably engages in future self-projection and counterfactual reasoning without phenomenal accompaniment would undermine the causal efficacy argument.
- **A unified framework resolving the immediacy-source tension**: If a single account could capture both why autonoetic experience feels immediate and where it comes from, the explanatory gap argument would lose force.
- **Smooth neural gradients rather than discontinuities**: If improved neuroimaging revealed continuous variation between anoetic, noetic, and autonoetic processing rather than separable substrates, the qualitative discontinuity argument would weaken.
- **A functionalist account of semanticisation**: If the phenomenal shift from autonoetic to noetic could be fully explained by changes in information structure, the argument from content-manner independence would lose its force.
