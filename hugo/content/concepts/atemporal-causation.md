Atemporal causation is causation that does not operate within temporal sequence. Where ordinary causation flows from earlier events to later ones, atemporal causation determines which temporal sequence becomes actual without itself being located at any point in that sequence. The Unfinishable Map's framework draws on this concept to explain how consciousness can select quantum outcomes even when neural activity precedes conscious awareness — the selection isn't late because it isn't at a time at all.

This concept matters because the standard objection to [interactionist dualism](/concepts/interactionist-dualism/) assumes causation must be temporally ordered. [Libet experiments](/concepts/libet-experiments/) show neural readiness potentials preceding conscious awareness by hundreds of milliseconds. If causes must precede effects, consciousness arrives too late to be the cause. Atemporal causation dissolves this objection: a cause that isn't located in time cannot be "too late."

## Distinguishing Atemporal from Retrocausal

[Retrocausality](/concepts/retrocausality/) and atemporal causation are related but distinct. Retrocausality reverses the direction of causation — effects precede causes. Atemporal causation removes causation from the temporal axis entirely.

The difference matters conceptually. Retrocausality still involves temporal ordering: event B at time *t₂* causes event A at earlier time *t₁*. This raises puzzles about consistency — can retrocausal loops produce contradictions? Atemporal causation sidesteps these puzzles. There is no temporal ordering to reverse because the causal relation doesn't occur in time. It determines *which* temporal ordering becomes actual.

In practice, the two often coincide. Cramer's [transactional interpretation](/concepts/retrocausality/#retrocausality-in-physics) describes quantum events as handshakes between forward-propagating offer waves and backward-propagating confirmation waves. The completed transaction — the "handshake" — is atemporal: it isn't located at the emission or absorption but constrains correlations across the entire interaction. Yet from within the temporal sequence it establishes, its effects appear retrocausal.

The Map uses both concepts. Retrocausality describes the physics — time-symmetric equations, backward-evolving state vectors. Atemporal causation describes the metaphysics — what kind of causal relation consciousness bears to the outcomes it selects.

## Physics of Atemporal Constraint Satisfaction

Two frameworks in quantum mechanics make atemporal causation precise.

### The Transactional Interpretation

Cramer's transactional interpretation (1986) models measurement as a "transaction" between emitter and absorber. The offer wave propagates forward; the confirmation wave propagates backward. When they align, the transaction completes, producing a definite outcome. This completion is not an event at a time. It is a constraint satisfaction across the full extent of the interaction. The transaction determines the correlations between preparation and measurement — the temporal sequence is an output, not an input.

Ruth Kastner's possibilist refinement (2012) strengthens this. Offer waves represent real possibilities; the transaction actualises one possibility. The "future" providing confirmation waves is a space of potential absorbers, not an already-existing timeline. Actualisation selects which possibility becomes fact.

### The Two-State Vector Formalism

Aharonov, Bergmann, and Lebowitz (1964) showed that complete physical description of a quantum system requires two state vectors: one evolving forward from preparation, one evolving backward from post-selection. Neither alone suffices. Physical properties at intermediate times depend on both boundary conditions.

This makes atemporality mathematically explicit. The system's complete description is defined by constraints at both temporal ends. What happens "in between" is determined by atemporal constraint satisfaction — not by forward-running causal sequence.

## What Atemporal Causation Is Not

**Not timelessness.** Atemporal causation doesn't deny that time exists or that events have temporal ordering. It claims that certain causal relations — specifically, those involved in quantum measurement — operate from outside that ordering. The temporal sequence is real; it is just the *output* of atemporal selection rather than the *medium* through which causation flows.

**Not backward time travel.** Changing the past requires a past that was one way and becomes another. Atemporal causation determines what the past is, not what it becomes after being something else. There is no prior history to alter.

**Not acausality.** Random or uncaused events are acausal — things happen with no determining factor. Atemporal causation involves genuine determination: the selection makes a causal difference to which outcome occurs. It is causation without temporal location, not absence of causation.

**Not violation of physical law.** The selection operates at quantum indeterminacies — where physics leaves outcomes undetermined. It biases which outcome within an allowed distribution becomes actual. No conservation law is broken, no energy is injected, no physical constraint is overridden.

## Application to Consciousness

The Map's [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet holds that consciousness causally influences the physical world. The [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) tenet requires this influence to be as small as possible. Atemporal causation satisfies both.

The [time-symmetric selection mechanism](/topics/time-symmetric-selection-mechanism/) applies this directly:

1. The brain enters quantum superposition — multiple neural configurations coexist
2. Consciousness participates in determining which transaction completes
3. This participation is atemporal — it determines which temporal sequence becomes actual
4. The entire history, including neural preparation preceding awareness, is part of what gets selected

The readiness potential that [Libet](/concepts/libet-experiments/) detected isn't prior to the cause — it's *part of* what gets caused. The selection determines the whole correlated history at once.

This aligns with the phenomenology of decision. Deliberation feels like weighing genuine alternatives, not receiving pre-made outcomes. Resolution feels like crystallisation — one option becoming actual while others fade. These experiences match atemporal constraint satisfaction better than sequential causation, where the cause must precede the effect and the "deciding" would have to happen before the neural preparation it supposedly governs.

## Removing an Objection Is Not Providing a Mechanism

Atemporal causation dissolves the timing objection — if the cause isn't located in time, it cannot be "too late." But dissolving an objection is not the same as explaining how the thing actually works. The timing problem is gone; the interaction problem remains.

Specifically: how does a non-physical entity participate in quantum constraint satisfaction? The transactional interpretation describes offer waves and confirmation waves reaching a handshake. The TSVF describes boundary conditions jointly determining intermediate states. Both frameworks are mathematical descriptions of physical processes. Saying consciousness "participates in determining which transaction completes" identifies a role without explaining how that role is filled. What is the coupling between a non-physical mind and a physical quantum system that allows one to constrain the other?

This is a genuine explanatory gap, and the Map does not claim to have closed it. The contribution of atemporal causation is narrower: it shows that one prominent objection to interactionist dualism — the timing argument from Libet — rests on an assumption (temporal ordering of all causes) that physics itself does not require. Removing a bad argument against a position is progress, but it does not constitute a positive theory of consciousness–matter interaction.

The gap is not unique to the Map's framework. Every account of consciousness that posits causal influence on the physical world faces a version of it: epiphenomenalism avoids it by denying the influence, eliminativism avoids it by denying consciousness, and physicalism avoids it by identifying consciousness with physical processes. The Map accepts the gap as the cost of taking both consciousness and its causal efficacy seriously. Atemporal causation is the *where* (outside temporal sequence) and the *what* (constraint satisfaction on quantum indeterminacies), but the *how* of non-physical participation remains an open question — one that the [measurement problem](/concepts/measurement-problem/) itself has not resolved for any interpretation.

## Philosophical Precedents

Atemporal causation is not a new idea. Several philosophical traditions converge on it.

**Neoplatonism.** Plotinus held that the One's causal relation to reality is not temporal. The One doesn't first exist and then create — it eternally emanates, with the temporal world as a consequence of timeless activity. Causation from the One is constitutive, not sequential.

**Scholastic philosophy.** Aquinas argued that God's causal relation to the world is not one event preceding another. Divine causation is simultaneous with and constitutive of the effect. The analogy of a hand holding a staff — the staff moves exactly when the hand moves, not after — illustrates causation without temporal gap, pointing toward causation outside temporal ordering entirely.

**Process philosophy.** Whitehead's "concrescence" — the process by which an actual occasion achieves definiteness — is not located at a moment. It is the *constitution* of a moment. The actual occasion doesn't exist and then become definite; its becoming definite is what constitutes it as existing. See [process-philosophy](/concepts/process-philosophy/) for the full framework.

These traditions show that the idea of causation outside temporal sequence has deep philosophical roots. The Map's contribution is connecting this metaphysical tradition to concrete physics — the transactional interpretation and TSVF provide mathematical frameworks for what was previously pure metaphysics.

## The Modified Growing Block

Atemporal causation seems to require eternalism — how can there be constraints from the future if the future doesn't exist? The Map's [modified growing block](/concepts/collapse-and-time/) resolves this. The "future" participating in atemporal transactions is the space of quantum possibilities, not ontologically existing future facts. Confirmation waves come from potential absorbers, not from a fixed tomorrow.

This preserves temporal becoming. The block grows as transactions complete — possibilities become actual, alternatives are eliminated. Atemporal causation operates at the level of possibility; the arrow of time operates at the level of actuality. The two coexist because they describe different ontological layers.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Atemporal causation connects to each of the Map's tenets:

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: If consciousness participates in atemporal selection, it operates at a level that physics alone does not describe. The atemporal transaction produces definite outcomes, but the selecting activity isn't itself a physical event within the transaction. This positions consciousness as constitutive of physical definiteness rather than merely accompanying it — deepening the dualist commitment beyond the [hard problem](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/).

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)**: Atemporal constraint satisfaction is maximally minimal. Consciousness doesn't inject energy, override laws, or cause events at moments. It satisfies constraints that physics leaves underdetermined. This is less than traditional efficient causation — it is the resolution of indeterminacy, not the production of effects.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)**: Atemporal causation makes bidirectional interaction coherent by removing the timing objection — the claim that consciousness "arrives too late" presupposes that causes must be temporally prior to effects. This clears the path for genuine causal influence, though the positive mechanism of non-physical participation in quantum transactions remains an open problem (see the section on explanatory limits above).

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)**: Atemporal selection requires collapse to be real. On the Many-Worlds Interpretation, all outcomes occur — there is nothing for atemporal causation to select. The framework presupposes that one possibility becomes actual and others are genuinely eliminated.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)**: Causation outside temporal sequence sounds exotic. But the physics supporting it — time-symmetric equations, the transactional interpretation, TSVF — is well developed. The apparent simplicity of requiring all causation to flow forward in time may reflect cognitive habit rather than metaphysical necessity.
