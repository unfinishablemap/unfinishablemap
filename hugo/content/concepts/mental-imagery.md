Mental imagery—perceptual representation without direct sensory input—provides paradigm evidence for consciousness's causal efficacy. When you deliberately visualize your childhood home or mentally rehearse a difficult conversation, you engage neural mechanisms that can subsequently guide behaviour. Voluntary mental imagery requires conscious engagement and lateral prefrontal cortex activation (LPFC), distinguishing it from involuntary imagery like dreams or intrusive flashbacks. This voluntary/involuntary distinction maps onto the conscious/unconscious distinction, suggesting consciousness adds a control function beyond automatic processing. If [epiphenomenalism](/arguments/epiphenomenalism/) were true—if consciousness merely observed neural activity without influencing it—the phenomenology of effortful visualization would be deeply mysterious: we would feel ourselves *directing* imagery while actually directing nothing.

## What Mental Imagery Is

Mental imagery is perceptual experience in the absence of direct sensory input. You can visualize a red apple without an apple before you, hear a melody in your mind without sound waves, or feel the texture of sandpaper without touching anything. Imagery operates across all sensory modalities—visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, gustatory—and can involve complex scenes, movements, or abstract spatial relationships.

The classical philosophical view treated imagery as essentially conscious: having an image meant being aware of it. British Empiricists like Hume treated ideas and images as the furniture of conscious thought. Contemporary neuroscience complicates this picture, showing that imagery can be either conscious or unconscious, and either voluntary or involuntary—a 2×2 matrix of possibilities.[^nanay]

| | Voluntary | Involuntary |
|---|---|---|
| **Conscious** | Deliberate visualization | Earworms, flashbacks |
| **Unconscious** | (Rare/contested) | Priming effects, unconscious bias |

The critical case for [bidirectional-interaction](/concepts/bidirectional-interaction/) involves the upper-left cell: deliberate, conscious visualization. When you voluntarily generate mental imagery, consciousness isn't merely observing—it's directing neural activity.

## Voluntary vs. Involuntary Imagery

The distinction between voluntary and involuntary imagery reveals different neurological mechanisms:

**Voluntary imagery** is mediated by the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC). Mental rotation tasks, deliberate planning, and creative visualization all require LPFC engagement. Damage to LPFC impairs the ability to voluntarily combine mental objects while leaving dreams intact.[^vyshedskiy]

**Involuntary imagery** operates independently of LPFC. Dreams, spontaneous daydreaming, and intrusive images like PTSD flashbacks arise without deliberate initiation. Many people with aphantasia—inability to voluntarily generate mental images—still experience visual dreams, demonstrating the dissociation between these systems.[^zeman]

This neurological dissociation matters philosophically. If voluntary and involuntary imagery were the same process, differing only in trigger, we wouldn't expect such different neural substrates. The LPFC's role in voluntary imagery suggests that conscious control engages mechanisms absent from automatic imagery processing. Consciousness adds something.

## Aphantasia and Hyperphantasia

Individual variation in imagery vividness ranges dramatically across the population:

- **Aphantasia** (~1% of population): Inability to voluntarily generate conscious mental images. When asked to visualize a red apple, aphantasics report no visual experience—"I know what an apple looks like, but I don't see anything."[^zeman]
- **Hyperphantasia** (~3% of population): Exceptionally vivid mental imagery, sometimes difficult to distinguish from perception.

Despite profound differences in subjective experience, both groups function effectively in daily life. Aphantasics can navigate, recognize faces, and engage in creative work—though they show reduced autobiographical memory and different cognitive styles. They're overrepresented in scientific and mathematical fields; hyperphantasics are overrepresented in creative professions.[^zeman]

This spectrum poses a puzzle for consciousness research. If the same neural machinery produces vivid imagery in one person and nothing in another, what explains the difference? One hypothesis: aphantasics have intact sub-personal imagery representations but lack conscious access to them. Supporting this view, some aphantasics show visual cortex activation during imagery tasks despite reporting no conscious experience.[^nanay] The imagery exists neurally; consciousness simply doesn't access it.

This interpretation aligns with the Map's [attention-as-interface](/concepts/attention-as-interface/) hypothesis. Imagery generation may be automatic; consciousness then selects which imagery to attend to, bringing it into awareness and enabling voluntary manipulation. The reliability of [introspective reports](/concepts/introspection/) about imagery vividness has been validated through convergent evidence: aphantasics' self-reports correlate with reduced performance on tasks requiring mental rotation and with distinct patterns of neural activation during imagery attempts.

## Motor Imagery and the Reality of Mental Causation

The strongest evidence for imagery's causal role comes from motor simulation research. Mental imagery of movement activates the same sensorimotor cortical networks as actual movement execution—premotor cortex, supplementary motor area, parietal regions.[^jeannerod] The brain treats imagined and executed movements similarly at the planning level.

This neural overlap has practical consequences:

- **Athletic training**: Meta-analyses show mental practice produces measurable performance improvements, with effect sizes (Cohen's d) ranging from 0.4 to 0.7 depending on task type. A systematic review found that mental imagery practice lasting ~10 minutes, 3 times weekly, over extended periods significantly improved motor performance, with effects strongest for tasks with substantial cognitive components.[^motor]
- **Rehabilitation**: Stroke patients using motor imagery in rehabilitation show enhanced recovery of movement function.
- **Music performance**: Pianists mentally rehearsing pieces show finger-specific motor activation and improved subsequent performance.

Motor simulation theory, developed by Marc Jeannerod, proposes that imagined movements serve as "templates for action"—internal simulations that the motor system can later execute.[^jeannerod] Francis Bacon's observation that "imagination ever precedeth voluntary action" captures this relationship: you imagine the action, then you perform it. The imagination causally contributes to the action.

If consciousness were epiphenomenal, this causal pathway would be mysterious. The phenomenology of deliberate motor imagery—the felt effort of visualizing a movement—would be causally disconnected from the subsequent improvement in performance. But the evidence suggests otherwise: conscious rehearsal produces physical results.

The physicalist might respond that it's the *neural* rehearsal doing the work, with conscious experience as mere accompaniment. Yet the voluntary/involuntary dissociation complicates this response: if neural activity alone sufficed, why would LPFC-mediated voluntary imagery produce different outcomes than LPFC-independent involuntary imagery? The conscious component tracks the efficacious component.

## Cognitive Phenomenology Without Imagery

Aphantasia provides evidence for non-imagistic conscious thought. Some aphantasics report having conscious thoughts without any sensory mental imagery—purely [cognitive phenomenology](/concepts/cognitive-phenomenology/). They think, reason, and experience understanding without visual, auditory, or other sensory accompaniments.[^lennon]

This matters for consciousness theory because it challenges views that reduce conscious thought to sensory imagery. If thoughts can be phenomenally conscious without being sensory, phenomenal consciousness includes non-sensory aspects that simple imagery-based accounts miss. The conscious experience of understanding a concept, grasping a proof, or apprehending an argument may be sui generis—neither visual nor auditory, but distinctively cognitive.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Mental imagery supports [bidirectional-interaction](/concepts/bidirectional-interaction/) through multiple channels:

**Voluntary imagery exemplifies conscious control.** The LPFC-mediated generation and manipulation of mental images requires conscious engagement. The effort you feel when visualizing something complex isn't epiphenomenal accompaniment—it reflects consciousness doing work. This parallels findings from [contemplative-neuroscience](/concepts/contemplative-neuroscience/): deliberate meditative attention reshapes neural structure through similar top-down processes.

**Motor imagery produces physical outcomes.** Athletes mentally rehearsing movements improve their actual performance. Consciousness (the deliberate imagery) causes physical changes (enhanced motor execution). The effect sizes are measurable and replicable—not mere correlation but a directional causal pathway from mental rehearsal to physical improvement.

**The voluntary/involuntary distinction tracks the conscious/unconscious distinction.** If consciousness added nothing, we'd expect no systematic difference between voluntary and involuntary imagery. But voluntary imagery requires different neural systems (LPFC), feels effortful, and can be directed at will—properties absent from automatic imagery like dreams.

**The explanatory gap manifests in imagery variation.** Why does the same visual cortex activation during imagery tasks produce vivid experience in hyperphantasics and nothing in aphantasics? If imagery were purely neural, identical activation should produce identical experience. The phenomenal difference outstrips the functional difference—supporting the [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism) tenet's claim that consciousness is irreducible.

The attention-imagery interface connects to the Map's broader framework. [Attention](/concepts/attention-as-interface/) may determine which imagery becomes conscious; consciousness then manipulates it; the manipulated imagery guides subsequent action. This chain—attention → conscious imagery → action—instantiates the bidirectional flow the Map posits.
