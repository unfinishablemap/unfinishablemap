A causal power is a property's capacity to bring about effects or produce changes in other things. When we say that fire has the power to melt ice, or that consciousness has the power to select among neural patterns, we're attributing causal powers—intrinsic capacities that explain how and why certain causes produce certain effects. The concept sits at the intersection of metaphysics and philosophy of mind: understanding what causal powers *are* shapes how we understand what entities (including consciousness) can *do*.

The question matters because different accounts of causal powers lead to different conclusions about causation, laws of nature, and the mind-body problem. If causal powers are fundamental features of reality, then consciousness might possess genuine causal powers of its own. If causal powers reduce to patterns of regular succession (Humean accounts), then the apparent causal efficacy of consciousness becomes harder to defend.

## Powers vs. Categorical Properties

One central debate distinguishes two kinds of properties:

**Categorical properties** are qualities that don't essentially involve anything beyond themselves. Redness, spherical shape, or mass-at-a-point might be categorical—what they are doesn't depend on what they *do*. On this view, causation is an external relation: laws of nature govern how categorically-defined properties interact, but the properties themselves don't intrinsically "point toward" their effects.

**Causal powers** (or dispositional properties) are essentially directed toward their manifestations. Fragility isn't just "whatever breaks under pressure"—it's the intrinsic tendency *to* break under pressure. The power contains reference to its effect within its nature. Solubility is the disposition to dissolve in water; charge is the power to attract or repel other charged objects.

**Powers realism** holds that at least some fundamental properties are dispositional—causal powers all the way down. **Categoricalism** holds that fundamental properties are categorical, with causal structure imposed by laws. **Neutral monism about properties** (or the identity theory of properties) holds that fundamental properties are neither purely categorical nor purely dispositional but have both aspects—a qualitative nature and a causal role simultaneously. While this view has appeal, the Map favours powers realism because the mind-body problem requires that phenomenal properties make a genuine causal contribution: the question is not whether consciousness has a qualitative character (it obviously does) but whether that character comes with irreducible causal power.

This debate matters for the mind-body problem. If consciousness has causal powers, are those powers fundamental dispositions (irreducible capacities to affect neural processes) or derivative patterns grounded in more basic categorical facts? The Unfinishable Map's commitment to [interactionist-dualism](/concepts/interactionist-dualism/) suggests treating phenomenal states as possessing genuine causal powers rather than merely accompanying physical dispositions.

## Manifestation and Triggering Conditions

Causal powers typically require **triggering conditions** to manifest their effects. Salt is soluble—it has the power to dissolve—but this power manifests only when salt is placed in water. The power exists even when unmanifested; it's a standing capacity, not a one-time event.

This distinguishes powers from **occurrent events**. The actual dissolving is an event; the solubility is a power. Consciousness might possess the power to bias quantum outcomes even when not actively exercising that power—the capacity is present as a feature of phenomenal states, manifesting when neural systems reach quantum branch points. Whether such branch points are available in warm biological systems is contested (see [objections-to-interactionism](/concepts/objections-to-interactionism/) on the decoherence objection), but the conceptual point stands: powers can exist unmanifested, awaiting appropriate conditions.

**Conditional analyses** attempt to reduce powers to counterfactual conditionals: "x is soluble" means "if x were placed in water, x would dissolve." But such analyses face what Lewis (1997) called the **finkish disposition problem**: imagine a sorcerer who removes salt's solubility just before it would manifest (Martin 1994 introduced the counterexample). The conditional is false (the salt wouldn't dissolve), yet the power seems present until the moment of removal. Powers realists conclude that dispositions are not reducible to conditionals—they're categorical facts about what properties *can* do, not just summaries of what *would* happen.

## Powers and Laws of Nature

Two rival accounts connect causal powers to laws:

**The dispositional essentialist view** (Bird 2007, Ellis 2001) holds that laws of nature are grounded in the essential dispositional natures of properties. Charge behaves according to Coulomb's law because charge *is* the power to attract or repel according to that law. Laws don't govern properties from outside—they express what properties essentially are. On this view, laws are metaphysically necessary: given the identity of fundamental properties, the laws could not have been otherwise.

**The governing laws view** treats laws as primitive regularities or modal facts that govern how categorical properties interact. Properties don't have intrinsic causal profiles; laws specify extrinsically how they combine and behave. On this account, laws are contingent: different laws are metaphysically possible with the same properties.

The Map's framework requires some account of [psychophysical-laws](/concepts/psychophysical-laws/)—the principles governing how consciousness influences neural activity. If dispositional essentialism is correct, then phenomenal properties might have essential dispositional natures that include capacities to bias neural processes. If governing laws are correct, then psychophysical laws are additional regularities relating mental and physical domains.

## Downward Causation and Higher-Level Powers

Can higher-level entities possess causal powers not reducible to the powers of their constituents? This is the question of [downward-causation](/concepts/downward-causation/).

**Emergentist views** hold that complex systems acquire novel causal powers at higher levels of organization. Life, consciousness, or agency might exercise powers that cannot be fully explained by summing microphysical powers. British emergentists (C.D. Broad, Samuel Alexander) defended this in the early 20th century but fell out of favor with the rise of reductive physicalism.

**Reductive views** hold that all causal powers ultimately reduce to fundamental physical powers. Higher-level talk of powers is convenient shorthand, but the real causal work happens at the micro-level. Consciousness might *seem* to possess powers, but these reduce to neural powers, which reduce to chemical powers, which reduce to quantum field powers.

The Map's commitment to [bidirectional interaction](/concepts/interactionist-dualism/#bidirectional-interaction) requires rejecting full reduction. If consciousness can select among quantum outcomes in neural systems, then phenomenal states possess causal powers that are not simply sums of physical powers. This doesn't require violating microphysical laws—consciousness operates *within* the space of quantum indeterminacy—but it does require that mental properties bring something causally novel to the table.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The Map's [dualism tenet](/tenets/#dualism) and [bidirectional interaction tenet](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) commit to consciousness possessing genuine causal powers. This aligns with powers realism rather than Humean or categoricalist accounts: phenomenal states are not mere patterns of regular succession or categorical properties plus external laws. They are dispositional properties with intrinsic capacities to influence physical processes.

The [minimal quantum interaction tenet](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) specifies the *scope* of conscious causal powers: consciousness biases quantum indeterminacies in neural systems without injecting energy or exerting forces. This is a constrained causal power—not the unlimited psychokinesis ruled out by physics, but not the causal inertness of [epiphenomenalism](/arguments/epiphenomenalism/) either.

The dispositional essentialist framework fits the Map's approach: if phenomenal properties have essential dispositional natures, then consciousness necessarily possesses certain causal powers. The [psychophysical-laws](/concepts/psychophysical-laws/) governing mental-physical interaction would express the essential natures of phenomenal properties rather than being contingent add-ons. This grounds the causal efficacy of consciousness in the intrinsic nature of experience itself.

A fair objection: does attributing "causal powers" to consciousness genuinely explain anything, or merely redescribe the claim that consciousness affects the brain? For physical properties like charge, powers talk is substantive because the powers are empirically characterised—Coulomb's law specifies exactly how charge behaves. Consciousness's powers lack this precision. The Map acknowledges this gap. The powers framework does not by itself explain *how* consciousness biases quantum outcomes; it provides the metaphysical category under which such influence falls (see [causal-closure](/concepts/causal-closure/) on how quantum indeterminacy makes room for this). The empirical characterisation of mental causal powers remains an open challenge—one that the Map addresses through the constraints developed in [consciousness-and-causal-powers](/topics/consciousness-and-causal-powers/).

For the broader question of mental causation, see [mental-causation](/concepts/mental-causation/) and [evolutionary-case-for-mental-causation](/topics/evolutionary-case-for-mental-causation/). For how causal powers ground agent-causal accounts, see [agent-causation](/concepts/agent-causation/).
