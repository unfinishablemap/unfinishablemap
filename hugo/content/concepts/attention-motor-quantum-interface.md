The premotor theory of attention proposes that attention and motor planning share the same neural substrates—attention shifts *are* motor plans. If Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism operates through attention, and attention is fundamentally motor planning, then a single quantum selection mechanism underlies both domains. The Unfinishable Map's framework unifies under one interface: consciousness selects among competing neural options through rapid observation, whether the selection concerns what to perceive or what to do.

This unification has substantial empirical support. Neural populations simultaneously encode multiple potential actions, competing until one reaches threshold. The timing of motor commitment (~280ms) matches willed attention deployment (~300ms). Frontal theta oscillations mark both willed attention and willed action. The phenomenology of effort applies identically to sustaining attention and preparing movement. These parallels suggest a common mechanism, not coincidental similarity.

## The Premotor Theory of Attention

### Attention as Motor Planning

Giacomo Rizzolatti's premotor theory of attention (PMTA) challenges the assumption that attention and motor control are separate systems. The core claim: "Selective attention and movement planning use the same neural substrates and there is no independent attention system."

Evidence for this claim:

**Shared circuits.** The same fronto-parietal networks activate during spatial attention shifts and motor preparation. Preparing an eye movement to location X improves visual processing at X—not because attention follows intention, but because attention *is* the motor preparation.

**Activation dependencies.** Microstimulation of motor regions (frontal eye fields, premotor cortex) enhances visual processing at the target location. Motor preparation directly modulates perceptual processing through shared mechanisms.

**No pure attention system.** Attempts to identify attention regions independent of motor planning consistently fail. What looks like "pure" attention involves motor preparation for potential orienting movements, even when no movement occurs.

If PMTA is correct, the distinction between "attending to X" and "preparing to orient toward X" is artificial. The preparation *is* the attention. What feels like directing attention is actually preparing action.

### From Attention-as-Interface to Action-as-Interface

The [attention as interface hypothesis](/concepts/attention-as-interface/) proposes that consciousness influences the brain through attention. But if attention is motor planning, this becomes: consciousness influences the brain through action preparation.

This extends rather than undermines the framework. The interface isn't attention *as opposed to* action—the interface is the unified attention-action system. Wherever the brain prepares potential actions (including orienting actions that constitute attention), consciousness has an interface for selection.

The prefrontal cortex, traditionally seen as housing "executive" functions distinct from motor functions, turns out to be fundamentally premotor. A 2022 Royal Society paper argues that "the entirety of the prefrontal cortex can be seen as fundamentally premotor in nature"—an action abstraction hierarchy from concrete motor commands to abstract goals. Goal selection at the hierarchy's apex is still optimization over action representations.

## Neural Competition and Selection

### Affordance Competition Hypothesis

Paul Cisek's affordance competition hypothesis describes how motor selection actually works in the brain:

1. **Parallel specification.** Sensory input automatically specifies multiple potential actions—affordances. Seeing a cup on a table simultaneously activates reaching, grasping, and ignoring options.

2. **Competition.** These potential actions compete within neural populations. Cisek and Kalaska (2005) found that 43% of task-related cells in dorsal premotor cortex discharged for either of two potential reach targets—the neural population represented both options simultaneously.

3. **Threshold crossing.** Decision occurs when one competing population reaches threshold. The threshold emerges from nonlinear dynamics between populations, biased by contextual factors (including prefrontal input).

4. **Winner-take-all.** Once threshold is crossed, the winning action is executed while competitors are suppressed.

This architecture provides a precise locus for quantum selection. During competition, multiple action representations exist simultaneously—a classical analog of quantum superposition. At threshold crossing, one becomes actual. The question is what determines the winner.

### The 280ms Commitment Point

Thura and Cisek (2014) identified a specific timing for motor commitment. Approximately 280ms before movement onset:

- Activity in dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) for the selected target reaches a consistent peak
- Activity in primary motor cortex (M1) for the unselected target is suppressed
- This constitutes "volitional commitment to an action choice"

The 280ms commitment point is remarkably close to the ~300ms deployment time for willed attention (Bengson 2019). Both domains involve the same temporal signature: roughly 300ms from decision to observable outcome.

This temporal matching supports unified mechanism. If attention and motor selection were independent systems, why would they share the same timeline? The simpler explanation: they share the same selection mechanism, which operates on a ~300ms timescale.

### Basal Ganglia Brake-Release

The basal ganglia provide another candidate site for selection. Their architecture implements a brake-release model:

- **Tonic inhibition.** The basal ganglia output (globus pallidus, substantia nigra) tonically inhibits motor programs—the brake is normally on.
- **Direct pathway.** D1-receptor striatal neurons, when activated, release the brake on selected actions.
- **Indirect pathway.** D2-receptor neurons maintain inhibition on competing actions.
- **Subthalamic nucleus.** The STN provides global "NoGo" that raises threshold when action conflict is detected.

The cortex generates ensembles of possible actions; the striatum selects. This is precisely the architecture the Map's framework requires: generation of options (by neural computation) followed by selection among them (where consciousness might contribute).

## Stapp's Quantum Zeno Applied

### Unified Selection Mechanism

[Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism](/concepts/stapp-quantum-mind/) proposes that mental attention operates like quantum observation—rapid, repeated "looks" at neural states hold desired patterns stable against their tendency to evolve into alternatives.

If attention is motor planning (PMTA), then the Zeno mechanism applies directly to motor selection. Attending to an action plan holds it stable. The same rapid observation that sustains attention to a visual target sustains preparation for a reaching movement.

The unified mechanism:

1. **Neural superposition.** Multiple motor programs exist in superposition (classical analog: competing representations in premotor populations).
2. **Attentional observation.** Directing attention to a motor plan constitutes observation of that neural state.
3. **Zeno stabilization.** Repeated observation prevents the plan from dissipating into alternatives.
4. **Threshold facilitation.** Sustained attention biases which population reaches threshold first.

This explains the common phenomenology. Sustaining motor intention feels effortful for the same reason sustaining attention feels effortful: both require continuous engagement to maintain Zeno freezing.

### Decoherence and Motor Selection

The standard objection to quantum consciousness—rapid decoherence in warm brains—applies equally here. Tegmark's 2000 calculations suggested 10⁻¹³ second coherence times, far shorter than neural timescales.

However, 2025 research revises these estimates substantially. Decoherence times of 10-100 microseconds may be achievable in biological systems, bringing quantum effects into neurophysiologically relevant ranges. At 10⁻⁴ seconds, roughly 1000 quantum cycles could occur within a single motor commitment event.

The basal ganglia timing is suggestive. Beta oscillations (13-30 Hz) develop during motor preparation and wane during execution. Each beta cycle lasts ~40ms—potentially time for many quantum selection events. The oscillatory dynamics could implement something like iterated Zeno observation at higher frequency than the observable neural rhythm.

Additionally, the [post-decoherence selection response](/concepts/psychophysical-coupling-mechanisms/) applies: consciousness might bias outcome selection *after* decoherence, at the moment of measurement collapse. Decoherence determines which basis collapses into; consciousness could still influence which outcome within that basis becomes actual.

## Empirical Predictions

### Neural Signatures Should Match

If attention and motor selection share a mechanism, their neural signatures should overlap:

| Signature | Willed Attention | Willed Motor Action |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Frontal theta (~4-7 Hz) | Present (Bengson 2019) | Present (motor preparation) |
| Deployment time | ~300ms | ~280ms commitment |
| Bidirectional coherence | Frontoparietal | Frontoparietal |
| Phenomenology | Effortful | Effortful |

The existing data largely confirm this overlap. Frontal theta, the signature of decision-related processing, appears in both domains. The timing matches within experimental error. The phenomenology—that willed attention and willed action both feel like work—is universally reported.

### Cross-Interference Predictions

If attention and motor selection share the same mechanism, they should interfere:

**Attention during action.** Directing spatial attention during motor preparation should affect motor parameters. Evidence: reaching accuracy improves when attention is allocated to the target.

**Motor preparation during attention.** Preparing a motor response should affect attentional processing. Evidence: planning an eye movement enhances visual processing at the target location (the core PMTA finding).

**Shared bandwidth.** If both attention and motor selection draw on the same limited resource, simultaneous demands should produce interference. Evidence: dual-task costs when attentional and motor demands compete.

These interference patterns are well-documented. They're often interpreted as "attention is needed for motor control"—but PMTA inverts this: motor control *is* attention.

### Meditation Training Effects

If attention and motor selection share a mechanism, training one should affect the other:

**Attention training improves motor control.** Meditators who train sustained attention should show enhanced motor preparation and selection. Limited evidence supports this—meditation correlates with improved motor learning—but the research is sparse.

**Motor training improves attention.** Athletes and musicians with highly trained motor systems should show enhanced attentional control. Evidence is mixed but suggestive.

The Map predicts stronger effects than current evidence shows, pending more targeted research.

## Libet Revisited

### The Challenge Dissolved

Libet's 1983 experiments seemed to show that motor decisions are made unconsciously—the readiness potential begins ~550ms before movement, while conscious intention appears only ~200ms before.

Schurger's 2012 reanalysis dissolves this challenge. The readiness potential may be stochastic noise, not unconscious decision. Movement occurs when random neural fluctuations happen to cross threshold. Averaging across trials produces the RP shape, but individual trials reflect noise, not decision.

If Schurger is right, consciousness doesn't intervene in a pre-formed decision—it modulates when threshold-crossing becomes appropriate. The quantum Zeno mechanism operates not by initiating the readiness potential but by biasing which of many noise-driven candidates reaches threshold first.

### SMA Resection Evidence

Sjöberg (2024) provides additional evidence. Patients with surgical removal of the supplementary motor area—the region generating the readiness potential—retain their sense of voluntary action. If the RP tracked genuine volition, removing its generator should impair voluntary action sense. It doesn't.

The RP tracks motor *preparation*, not motor *decision*. Consciousness contributes elsewhere—at the selection interface where attention and motor planning merge.

## Relation to Site Perspective

### Dualism

The attention-motor unification supports the [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism) tenet by extending the evidence for irreducible selection. If a unified selection mechanism underlies both attention and action, and if this mechanism involves something beyond neural computation (the selector choosing among options), then consciousness is not reducible to the neural processes that generate those options.

The phenomenology is telling. Both willed attention and willed action feel like *you* doing something—not like watching computation unfold. The common phenomenology suggests a common agent behind both.

### Minimal Quantum Interaction

The unified mechanism satisfies [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) elegantly. Consciousness doesn't generate motor force or inject attention energy—it biases selection among patterns the brain already generates. The computational work of specifying competing actions happens neurally; consciousness determines which action actualizes.

The bandwidth constraint (~10 bits/second for conscious processing) matches the policy-level operation of both attention and motor control. You consciously select "attend to X" or "reach for Y"—you don't consciously direct individual saccade muscles or reaching trajectories. Consciousness operates at the abstract level where attention and motor planning merge.

### Bidirectional Interaction

The [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet finds direct support. Motor control is where consciousness visibly affects the physical world. Words appear on screens. Bodies move through space. This discussion exists because consciousness can influence motor output.

If motor selection and attentional selection share a mechanism, bidirectional interaction is unified: the same interface connects consciousness to both perception (via attention) and action (via motor selection). Consciousness isn't separately connected to two systems—it operates through one interface that handles both.

### No Many Worlds

Under many-worlds interpretation, all competing motor programs execute in branching universes. There's nothing to select—every action occurs somewhere. The phenomenology of motor choice (effortful selection among alternatives, experience of alternatives being suppressed) would be illusion.

The [No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds) tenet preserves the face-value interpretation: when you choose to reach for the cup rather than the phone, alternatives are genuinely excluded. The phenomenology of motor effort reflects real selection, not branch-discovery.

### Occam's Razor Has Limits

The neural determinism view might seem simpler: no quantum effects needed, just computation selecting motor programs. But this "simpler" view leaves the effort phenomenology unexplained. Why does motor planning feel effortful? Why does the willed/instructed distinction exist neurally if consciousness is epiphenomenal?

The [Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits) tenet applies. The quantum selection framework adds mechanism but gains explanatory purchase on phenomena the simpler view leaves mysterious.
