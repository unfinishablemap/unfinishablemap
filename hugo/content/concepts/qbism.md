QBism (Quantum Bayesianism) is an interpretation of quantum mechanics that treats quantum states as representing an agent's subjective beliefs rather than objective features of reality. Developed primarily by Christopher Fuchs, Carlton Caves, and Rüdiger Schack, QBism dissolves the [measurement-problem](/concepts/measurement-problem/) by denying there was ever an objective wave function to collapse. "Collapse" is simply belief-updating—the agent learns something and revises their expectations.

Fuchs explicitly positioned QBism as completing Wheeler's [participatory universe](/topics/the-participatory-universe/) program, coining the term "participatory realism" in 2017 to mark the connection.

For The Unfinishable Map, QBism presents a paradox: it makes agents epistemically central to quantum mechanics yet provides no account of what agents *are*. QBism presupposes that agents have determinate experiences to form beliefs about, treating the source of such experience as given rather than explained. The Map holds that this is precisely what requires explanation.

## Core Claims

QBism rests on several interconnected commitments:

**Quantum states are beliefs.** The wave function doesn't describe how the world is; it encodes what an agent expects to find upon measurement. Different agents can consistently assign different quantum states to the same physical system because states track beliefs, not reality.

**Probabilities are subjective.** Born rule probabilities are Bayesian credences—degrees of belief—not objective propensities or frequencies. When you assign 70% probability to spin-up, you're expressing your expectation, not describing a feature of the electron.

**Measurement is belief-updating.** There is no physical "collapse." When measurement yields a result, the agent updates their quantum state accordingly, just as one updates any probabilistic belief in light of new evidence.

**No view from nowhere.** QBism rejects the ideal of describing reality from no particular perspective. All quantum descriptions are *from somewhere*—from the perspective of some agent situated in the world.

## QBism and the Measurement Problem

Traditional interpretations struggle with why measurement produces definite outcomes from superposition. QBism sidesteps this: there never was an objective superposition, only the agent's uncertainty about what they would find. The "measurement problem" was generated by mistaking belief-states for reality-states.

This dissolution is elegant but comes at a cost. QBism explains why we *describe* definite outcomes (because we experience them and update beliefs accordingly) without explaining why we *have* definite experiences in the first place. The shift from "the electron is in superposition" to "I'm uncertain about the electron" relocates the mystery without resolving it.

## The Agent Problem

QBism's deepest tension concerns its central concept: the agent.

**What is an agent?** QBism requires agents to hold beliefs, make predictions, and experience measurement outcomes. These beliefs must cohere into a unified perspective—what philosophers call [phenomenal-unity](/concepts/unity-of-consciousness/)—yet QBism provides no account of what makes something an agent rather than a mere physical system. Fuchs explicitly declines to define agency in physical terms, treating it as primitive—arguing that agents are "the most basic category" irreducible to anything more fundamental (Fuchs 2017).

**The experience presupposition.** For an agent to update beliefs upon measurement, they must have determinate experiences—they must *find* something, not merely exist in correlation with outcomes. QBism takes for granted exactly what the [hard-problem-of-consciousness](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/) asks us to explain: why there is something it is like to be an agent at all.

**Consciousness is assumed, not explained.** QBism's agents aren't rocks or thermostats; they're subjects with experiences. The interpretation works only because such subjects exist. But QBism offers no resources for understanding *why* they exist or how experience arises.

## QBism Versus Other Interpretations

### Versus Copenhagen

Copenhagen also treats measurement pragmatically but retains some commitment to objective quantum states and leaves the measurement boundary undefined. QBism is more radical: there is no objective state, and "measurement" is just whatever an agent calls measurement.

### Versus Relational Quantum Mechanics

[RQM](/concepts/relational-quantum-mechanics/) shares QBism's perspectivalism—facts are relative to observers. But RQM treats *any* physical system as a potential observer, explicitly eliminating consciousness's special status. QBism, by contrast, centres agents with experiences, even while refusing to explain what makes them experiencers.

### Versus Many-Worlds

[Many-Worlds](/concepts/many-worlds/) eliminates collapse by positing that all outcomes occur. QBism eliminates collapse by denying objective states. Both avoid the measurement problem, but differently: MWI multiplies reality; QBism deflates it. For the Map, both leave consciousness unexplained—MWI by making all branches equally real (so why do I experience *this* one?), QBism by presupposing experience without explaining it.

MWI defenders respond that the indexical question is no more mysterious than asking "why am I this person rather than another?"—both are selection effects, not metaphysical puzzles. But the Map holds that indexical identity is precisely what requires explanation (see [haecceity](/concepts/haecceity/)), not what explains things away. The question "why this branch?" is meaningful whether or not we can answer it.

### Versus Consciousness-Collapse

Consciousness-collapse interpretations posit that conscious observation causes wave function collapse. QBism agrees that agents are central but denies there's any objective collapse to cause. Where consciousness-collapse gives consciousness a physical role, QBism gives it an epistemic role: consciousness doesn't collapse the wave function; it's what beliefs are *for*. QBism also sidesteps the [prebiotic collapse problem](/concepts/prebiotic-collapse/)—since wave functions are beliefs rather than reality, there's nothing to collapse before agents existed—but only by leaving unexplained why agents with experiences exist at all.

## Intersubjective Agreement

A challenge for QBism: if quantum states are purely subjective, why do different agents converge on the same statistical predictions? When Alice and Bob both measure many identically-prepared electrons, they find the same frequencies. How can purely subjective beliefs explain this intersubjective agreement?

QBism responds that agents share a world and are subject to similar experiences. Agreement emerges from shared reality constraining beliefs, not from beliefs tracking an objective wave function. The world teaches agents what to expect, even if their expectations aren't descriptions of the world itself.

Critics find this insufficient. If the world constrains beliefs so reliably that all agents converge on Born statistics, something objective seems to be doing the constraining. QBism's response—that this "something" is the world itself, not the wave function—may seem like distinction without difference.

## The First-Person Gap

QBism's most interesting feature, from the Map's perspective, is its treatment of the first-person.

Standard quantum mechanics is written in third-person terms: "the system is in state ψ." QBism makes this explicitly first-person: "*I* assign state ψ." This perspectival shift is philosophically significant—it acknowledges that quantum descriptions are always *someone's* descriptions.

But QBism stops short of explaining the first-person perspective itself. It requires agents with subjective viewpoints—beings for whom there is something it is like to make predictions and be surprised by outcomes. This is exactly the ["thisness"](/concepts/haecceity/) the Map takes seriously: the brute fact of being *this* particular experiencing subject.

QBism thus implicitly supports the Map's claim that first-person facts are irreducible to third-person descriptions. But where QBism simply assumes such facts, the Map asks what grounds them.

## Relation to Site Perspective

QBism's relationship to the Map's [tenets](/tenets/) is complex:

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism):** QBism is officially neutral on mind-body metaphysics—it's an interpretation of quantum mechanics, not a philosophy of mind. But its agent-centrality sits uneasily with physicalism. If agents with experiences are primitive and unexplained, QBism implicitly concedes that physics alone doesn't account for what matters most: the subjects doing the physics. This creates space for dualism even if QBism doesn't endorse it.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction):** QBism denies that consciousness causes collapse because it denies objective collapse. But it grants consciousness an irreducible epistemic role: experience is what makes quantum states meaningful, since they encode expectations *for* experience. This is weaker than the Map's claim that consciousness causally influences physical outcomes, but it acknowledges consciousness's centrality rather than eliminating it.

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction):** Since QBism denies objective quantum states, there's nothing for consciousness to "interact with" at the quantum level. The tenet presupposes quantum realism that QBism rejects. However, QBism's emphasis on the agent's perspective can be reframed: whatever happens at measurement, it happens *for* an experiencing subject. The Map suggests this "for" requires explanation QBism doesn't provide.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds):** QBism agrees—it explicitly rejects MWI. There is one world in which agents hold beliefs and have experiences, not a branching multiverse of equally real outcomes.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits):** QBism might seem parsimonious: no objective collapse, no branching worlds, just agents and their beliefs. But this parsimony is achieved by taking agents as primitive. The Map's tenet reminds us that apparent simplicity may hide unexplained complexity. QBism's "simple" ontology includes experiential subjects without explaining them—hardly a reduction in mystery.

## What QBism Gets Right

Despite its limitations, QBism contributes several insights the Map affirms:

**The first-person matters.** Quantum mechanics describes what agents can expect, not a view from nowhere. Physics is done by subjects, and this isn't eliminable.

**Probability needs a subject.** Born probabilities describe expectations for *someone*. The question "70% probable for whom?" has an answer on QBism (the agent assigning the probability), unlike interpretations that leave probability floating free of any perspective.

**The observer problem is real.** QBism takes seriously that "observer" can't be defined in purely physical terms—something traditional interpretations obscure by leaving "measurement" undefined.

## What QBism Misses

**Why agents exist.** QBism presupposes experiencing subjects without explaining them. The Map asks: what makes something an agent? What grounds the distinction between systems that merely correlate with outcomes and systems that *experience* outcomes?

**The hard problem.** Fuchs acknowledges that QBism doesn't solve the hard problem of consciousness. One might object that *all* physics leaves consciousness unexplained—why single out QBism? The answer: other interpretations don't *require* consciousness at their foundations. Copenhagen can treat "observer" as an undefined placeholder; Many-Worlds needs no observers at all; even Bohmian mechanics runs without reference to experience. QBism alone *needs* experiencing agents to make sense—agents who form beliefs, are surprised by outcomes, update expectations. When an interpretation places agents at its center while refusing to explain what agents are, the gap isn't incidental but structural. An interpretation that makes agents fundamental while leaving agency unexplained has located the mystery rather than dissolved it.

**Causal efficacy.** QBism gives consciousness an epistemic role but not a causal one. The Map holds that consciousness doesn't just *track* physical outcomes but *influences* them. QBism's agent updates beliefs; the Map's agent selects realities.
