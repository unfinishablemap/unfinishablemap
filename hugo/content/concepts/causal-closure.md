Causal closure of the physical is the thesis that every physical event that has a cause has a *sufficient* physical cause. If true, nothing outside the physical realm ever makes a causal difference to what happens physically. This principle underlies the most influential contemporary argument against [interactionist-dualism](/archive/arguments/interactionist-dualism/)—and The Unfinishable Map's framework depends on its rejection.

## The Principle Stated

The thesis admits several formulations of varying strength:

**Strong version (Kim):** No physical event has a cause outside the physical domain. Physical causes are not just sufficient but *exclusive*.

**Moderate version:** Every physical effect that has a sufficient cause has a sufficient *physical* cause. Weaker forms allow that physical events might also have non-physical causes—they just require that physical causes are always available.

**Completeness version (Montero):** Every physical event has a physical cause. This doesn't exclude other causes but ensures the physical story is always self-contained.

The differences matter. Strong closure rules out mental causation directly; moderate versions create overdetermination problems (two sufficient causes for one effect); completeness alone might allow room for consciousness to act.

As Karl Popper noted, causal closure "is of decisive importance and I take it as the characteristic principle of physicalism or materialism." Accept it, and interactionist dualism becomes impossible.

## The Exclusion Argument

Jaegwon Kim's exclusion argument deploys causal closure against non-reductive physicalism, but it applies equally to dualism. (See [reductionism](/concepts/reductionism/) for fuller treatment of Kim's argument and how ontological, methodological, and epistemic reductionism differ.)

1. Physical events have sufficient physical causes (causal closure)
2. Mental events cause physical events (common-sense premise)
3. Mental causes don't overdetermine physical events alongside physical causes (no systematic overdetermination)
4. Therefore, mental causes just *are* physical causes (identity theory)

For dualists who reject identity, the argument forces a choice: deny that mental events cause anything ([epiphenomenalism](/arguments/epiphenomenalism/)), or deny causal closure.

The Map denies causal closure.

## Why Causal Closure Seems Plausible

The principle has intuitive appeal:

**Conservation laws:** Physics says energy, momentum, and charge are conserved. If mind could add to physical effects, it would have to inject energy. But energy is conserved. So mind cannot add anything. However, as [conservation-laws-and-mind](/topics/conservation-laws-and-mind/) demonstrates, this objection rests on misunderstandings. Conservation is *local* (holding in each region separately) and *conditional*—Noether's theorem derives conservation from symmetries, and external influences (like mental causes) break those symmetries. The objection begs the question by assuming no such influences exist. More importantly, consciousness may influence outcomes without injecting energy at all, by *selecting* among quantum-permitted outcomes rather than adding anything new.

**Scientific success:** Physics explains physical events without needing to invoke non-physical causes. Every time science investigates a phenomenon, it finds physical mechanisms. Mental causation seems like a "gap" that science will eventually fill.

**Explanatory closure:** Physical explanations are complete. When we trace causes back, we never need to exit the physical domain to explain what happens.

These considerations are powerful but not decisive.

## Problems with the Principle

### Kim's Formulation Dilemma

Kim himself acknowledged a critical challenge in formulating causal closure. The principle must be neither too strong nor too weak:

**If too strong** (no physical event has any non-physical cause), the principle simply presupposes physicalism. The argument against mental causation becomes circular—assuming what it's meant to prove.

**If too weak** (physical events have physical causes but maybe other causes too), it doesn't exclude mental causation. The argument loses force.

Finding the right formulation—strong enough to exclude dualist mental causation but not so strong as to beg the question—proves difficult. The principle's apparent plausibility may depend precisely on this ambiguity.

### Observational vs Universal Closure

Bradford Saad (2025) identifies a crucial distinction that weakens the causal closure objection: *universal* closure is stronger than what physics actually supports. The [observational-closure](/concepts/observational-closure/) concept page develops this distinction in detail.

**Universal closure**: Every physical event has a sufficient physical cause. No exceptions anywhere.

**[Observational closure](/concepts/observational-closure/)**: There are no *observable* violations of closure—no violations detectable by physics or neuroscience experiments.

> **Observational Closure**: "There are no observable violations of Closure." An observable violation is "a violation of Closure that would be recognized as such by an experiment of the sort performed in physics or neuroscience that lies within the realm of nomic possibility." (Saad 2025)

This distinction matters because the empirical evidence for causal closure—the success of physics—only supports observational closure. Experiments show that *within experimental contexts*, physical causes suffice. They do not show that physical causes suffice *everywhere*, including in the private domain of consciousness.

Dualists need only respect observational closure. If mental causation operates at points where physics leaves outcomes undetermined (such as quantum indeterminacies), and if experiences cause exactly what the corresponding physical states would have caused, no experiment reveals the difference. Physics appears complete in laboratories even if consciousness operates causally elsewhere.

This reframes the dialectic. The closure argument claims physics is complete, so mental causes are excluded. But if "complete" means only "complete where we can test," and if mental causation respects this constraint, the argument loses force. [Saad's delegatory framework](/topics/delegatory-dualism/) develops this insight further: experiences *preempt* rather than overdetermine physical causation, satisfying observational closure while rejecting universal closure.

### Empirical Status

Causal closure is not an empirical finding but a methodological assumption. Science does not *discover* that every physical event has a sufficient physical cause—it *assumes* this in order to search for physical causes. The success of physics shows that *many* physical events have physical causes, not that *all* do.

This matters for [reductionism](/concepts/reductionism/). If causal closure is an ontological thesis (a claim about what exists and what causes what), it requires independent justification. If it is merely a methodological thesis (a useful assumption for scientific inquiry), it cannot establish that mental causes don't exist—only that scientific method doesn't look for them. Reductionists treat methodological success as evidence for ontological claims, but methodological reductionism does not entail ontological reductionism.

Moreover, the history of science shows unexpected discoveries that violated prior assumptions. That no violation has been found doesn't mean none exists—especially in domains (like consciousness) that resist physical investigation.

To be clear: the Map's position also involves metaphysical commitments beyond empirical evidence. The claim that consciousness fills quantum gaps is not more empirically supported than the claim that physics is complete. Both positions extrapolate from evidence to metaphysics. The question is which extrapolation better accounts for the full range of phenomena—including the existence of consciousness itself and its apparent causal efficacy.

### The Quantum Exception

This is the Map's primary response: quantum mechanics violates causal closure as standardly formulated.

In quantum mechanics, physical systems evolve deterministically under the Schrödinger equation—until measurement. At measurement, the system "collapses" from superposition to a definite state. Physics specifies the *probabilities* of outcomes but not *which* outcome occurs. The theory is fundamentally stochastic.

This means: *not every physical event has a sufficient physical cause*. When a radioactive atom decays, physics tells us the probability it will decay in the next hour, but nothing physical determines *whether* it will. The physical causes are insufficient. The physical story is incomplete.

**Objection from hidden variables**: Couldn't deterministic hidden variable theories (like Bohmian mechanics) restore causal closure? They provide deterministic completion of quantum mechanics—particles have definite positions, and their evolution is fully determined by both the wave function and hidden variables.

The Map's response: Hidden variable theories add explanatory machinery beyond what's observed. Occam's Razor cuts both ways—if we're adding unobservable entities, consciousness (which we directly experience) is no less parsimonious than unobservable hidden variables (which we don't). More decisively, the Map rejects Many-Worlds interpretations (see [Tenet 4](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)) and pilot-wave theories face similar indexical identity problems: why am *I* the consciousness associated with *this* particle trajectory rather than another?

**The probabilistic causation response**: Some argue that probabilistic causation is still causation—the wave function causally explains the *distribution* of outcomes even if not each individual one. But this conflates statistical explanation with causal sufficiency. A sufficient cause produces its effect; a probability distribution leaves the actual outcome undetermined. The distribution explains why *some atom* decayed, not why *this atom* did. If nothing physical determines which outcome occurs, physics is causally incomplete at that point.

**The overdetermination worry**: Even granting indeterminism, doesn't consciousness biasing quantum outcomes constitute overdetermination? The wave function determines probability distributions; consciousness determines which outcome within that distribution. Two causes, one effect.

The Map's response: If consciousness *violates* the Born rule (produces outcome frequencies different from quantum probabilities), that would be overdetermination—empirically testable and not found. But consciousness operating *within* probabilistic constraints—selecting among quantum-permitted outcomes at the frequencies physics specifies—is complementary determination, not overdetermination. Physics provides the range and statistical weights; consciousness provides the particular outcome. Compare: chess rules constrain legal moves without overdetermining which move occurs.

Bradford Saad's [delegatory-dualism](/topics/delegatory-dualism/) (2025) offers another response: physical states *delegate* their causal responsibilities to conscious experiences via preemption rather than duplication. When pain causes wincing, the physical state's contribution is preempted, not doubled—like how a major's order preempts a sergeant's. The Map's quantum framework and Saad's delegation mechanism may be complementary: quantum indeterminacy provides the substrate; delegation explains the causal structure.

If consciousness acts at these indeterminacies—selecting among outcomes physics leaves undetermined—it causes physical events without violating any physical law. No energy is injected (the outcomes are among those physics already allows). The selection operates within quantum mechanical constraints, not against them.

### Stapp's Quantum Response

[Henry Stapp's quantum Zeno framework](/concepts/stapp-quantum-mind/) provides the most detailed account of how consciousness operates at quantum indeterminacies without violating causal closure's core insight. The mechanism has four key features that directly address the exclusion problem:

**1. Operates where physics is silent**: Quantum mechanics specifies probabilities but not which outcome actualizes. When a neuron faces superposed firing patterns, physics determines the *range* of possibilities and their statistical weights, but leaves the particular outcome undetermined. Consciousness fills this genuine gap rather than competing with physical causes.

**2. No energy injection**: The quantum Zeno effect works through repeated observation that "freezes" desired neural states. No energy is added; attention increases the measurement rate of quantum states, collapsing superpositions toward the attended alternative within the energy constraints physics already specifies. Conservation laws remain intact.

**3. Complementary determination**: The wave function provides probabilities; consciousness provides particularity. This isn't overdetermination (two sufficient causes for one effect) but complementary determination: physics constrains what *can* happen and how *often* each possibility occurs statistically; consciousness determines what *does* happen in this instance. Compare: chess rules constrain legal moves, but the player determines which legal move occurs—the rules don't overdetermine the move.

**4. Phenomenologically grounded**: The "effort of will" that William James described corresponds to repeated quantum measurements that stabilize one outcome over competitors. What attention *feels like* from the inside matches what the Zeno effect *does* from the physics perspective. This isn't consciousness operating from outside physics but consciousness *being* the process that resolves quantum indeterminacy at specific neural locations.

The Stapp mechanism transforms the causal closure debate. The principle's intuitive force comes from assuming physics determines everything. Once quantum indeterminacy is recognized—not as ignorance but as genuine ontological openness—the closure objection loses its grip. Consciousness acts precisely where physics becomes "silent," making mental causation compatible with physical law.

**The decoherence challenge**: Critics object that quantum coherence cannot survive in warm, wet biological systems—decoherence destroys superpositions before consciousness could select among them. This is a serious empirical challenge. The Map's response has three components:

First, decoherence timescales remain disputed. While Tegmark calculated femtosecond decoherence for microtubules, Hameroff's group calculated nanosecond to picosecond timescales—seven orders of magnitude longer—and Stuart Hameroff notes that biological systems demonstrably exploit quantum effects (avian magnetoreception, photosynthesis). This doesn't prove neural quantum coherence but shows the door isn't empirically closed.

Second, and more fundamentally, decoherence doesn't solve the measurement problem—it only spreads superposition into the environment. Something must still select which outcome becomes actual from the decohered mixture. If consciousness is that something, decoherence doesn't eliminate its role; it just means consciousness operates on decohered states rather than pure superpositions.

Third, the quantum Zeno effect may *sustain* coherence through repeated measurement. If attention itself constitutes quantum observation, then sustained attention prevents decoherence in the attended neural state. This is Stapp's key insight: consciousness doesn't just select among existing superpositions; its attention *maintains* the superposition long enough for selection to matter.

See [the decoherence response](/concepts/quantum-consciousness/#the-decoherence-objection) for detailed treatment.

This argument appears in formal premise-conclusion form in the [argument for interactionist dualism](/archive/arguments/interactionist-dualism/): the closure objection fails because physics does not exclude mental causation at quantum indeterminacies.

This is the [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) tenet: consciousness influences physical outcomes at quantum indeterminacies, where the physical story runs out. The [connection between the measurement problem and the hard problem](/topics/consciousness-and-quantum-measurement/) develops this further: both problems share a structure where third-person physical descriptions fail to capture first-person facts.

### The Emergentist Response

Strong [emergentism](/concepts/emergence/) provides another route to denying causal closure. Timothy O'Connor and Hong Yu Wong argue that emergent properties possess "fundamentally novel" causal powers not reducible to component-level causation—genuine [downward-causation](/concepts/downward-causation/) where consciousness influences neural states in ways component interactions don't determine.

Classical British emergentists (Broad, Alexander) accepted this with "natural piety" but lacked a mechanism, leaving them vulnerable to Kim's exclusion argument. The Map's quantum framework strengthens emergentism by specifying where emergent causation operates: at quantum indeterminacies, where physics provides probabilities but not outcomes. [Spontaneous collapse theories](/concepts/spontaneous-collapse-theories/) (GRW, CSL) further strengthen the position: they provide consciousness-independent baseline collapse, allowing consciousness to *modulate* rather than wholly cause collapse—preserving prebiotic cosmology while enabling mental causation. Downward causation becomes coherent because the "downward" direction operates precisely where the "upward" physical story is incomplete.

### Arguments from Reason

C.S. Lewis and Alvin Plantinga argued that causal closure undermines rational thought itself. If beliefs have purely physical causes, then beliefs about physics—including belief in causal closure—are caused by chemistry, not by *reasons*. A belief caused by neurotransmitter binding isn't thereby *justified*.

Reliabilists respond that causal processes can track truth without non-physical reasons. But this requires causal processes to be sensitive to *logical* relationships—validity, consistency, evidential support. These are normative, not physical. A neuron fires because chemistry, not *because modus ponens is valid*. If consciousness causes nothing, the correlation between logical justification and what we believe becomes inexplicable.

This argument is contested but highlights reflexivity: if the belief in causal closure is just a neural state caused by chemistry rather than by reasons, why should we accept those reasons as relevant?

## Causal Closure and Free Will

The connection to [free-will](/topics/free-will/) is immediate. If every physical event has a sufficient physical cause, there's no room for "my choice" to make a difference—the outcome was physically determined (or randomly fluctuated within fixed probabilities).

The Map takes a different route. Quantum indeterminism means physical outcomes are not fully determined. If consciousness can bias which indeterminate outcome occurs, it can influence events in a way that's neither determined nor random—what libertarian free will requires. Robert Kane's Self-Forming Actions framework parallels this: free will emerges at indeterministic moments where the agent's effort influences which outcome occurs. The Map provides the *mechanism* Kane leaves underspecified.

Critics raise the [luck objection](/concepts/luck-objection/): if the outcome is undetermined, isn't it just random? The Map's response: consciousness *selects* outcomes rather than merely receiving them. The felt character of deciding and striving *is* the selection process—not efficient causation (prior states producing subsequent states) but final causation (intentions directing outcomes). This isn't invoking a homunculus; it's recognizing that phenomenal states constitute a distinct mode of causation that resolves indeterminacy through intentional directedness rather than random fluctuation.

## Relation to the Map's Perspective

The Map *rejects* causal closure as a universal principle. The [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) tenet holds that physics is not causally complete at quantum indeterminacies. The [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet holds that consciousness acts at these points.

This rejection is not arbitrary but principled:

1. **Quantum mechanics** shows that not all physical events have sufficient physical causes. The physical domain has genuine gaps.

2. **Consciousness reporting** shows that mental states influence physical behavior. When you report seeing red, information about your experience enters your verbal behavior. This requires mental→physical causation. Physicalists must either deny the information is about phenomenal experience (implausible—what else are you reporting?) or explain how phenomenal experience causes the report (conceding mental causation).

3. **Self-stultification** shows that denying mental causation undermines rational thought. If consciousness causes nothing, our beliefs about consciousness are causally disconnected from actual experiences. If you accept [epiphenomenalism](/arguments/epiphenomenalism/)—the view that causal closure forces—then your belief in epiphenomenalism isn't caused by the experiences that supposedly motivate it. The belief and the experiences are causally unrelated. This makes epiphenomenalism self-undermining: if true, we have no reason to believe it (since reasons are mental states that would have to cause belief-formation to justify beliefs).

The Map doesn't claim certainty about *how* consciousness interfaces with quantum events—that remains an open empirical question addressed by [quantum consciousness research](/concepts/quantum-consciousness/) and detailed in [Stapp's quantum Zeno framework](/concepts/stapp-quantum-mind/). But it holds that such interface is possible because causal closure fails where physics is fundamentally indeterminate.

**Note on Many-Worlds**: The entire causal closure debate presupposes collapse interpretations. Under [Many-Worlds Interpretation](/tenets/#no-many-worlds), all quantum outcomes occur in different branches, and consciousness doesn't "select" among outcomes—it just tracks which branch you're on. The Map rejects MWI (Tenet 4) on grounds of indexical identity: if all versions of you exist across branches, the question "Why am I experiencing *this* outcome rather than another?" has no answer. The rejection of MWI is thus doing crucial work for the Map's framework—if MWI were correct, consciousness wouldn't need to resolve indeterminacies because there would be nothing to resolve.

## The Coherence of Rejection

Rejecting causal closure might seem to invite chaos—if physics isn't complete, how does anything work reliably?

The answer: physics is *almost* complete. Quantum indeterminacies are tiny, and the statistical laws of quantum mechanics ensure that large-scale regularities emerge from microscopic randomness.

But why don't consciousness-influenced quantum events aggregate to detectable violations of physical law?

The statistical response: Consciousness biases only indeterminacies that matter for cognition—quantum events in neural systems prepared for amplification. In non-neural systems (bridge atoms, thermalization events), any biases average out to undetectable fluctuations within quantum statistical variation. Causal closure's failure allows *small* deviations that influence which superposed neural state becomes actual—statistically invisible outside neural systems, yet decisive for agency and thought.

**Testability**: What would falsify the Map's position? Several possibilities: (1) demonstration that quantum coherence is *never* maintained at neural timescales under any conditions, (2) proof that quantum effects, even if present, cannot be amplified to affect neural firing, (3) identification of purely classical mechanisms sufficient to explain all consciousness-related phenomena including reportability and metacognition, or (4) discovery that consciousness reports don't correlate with quantum effects in predicted ways. The Map's position is not empirically equivalent to physicalism—it makes testable predictions about quantum biology in neural systems.

This is not "god of the gaps" reasoning. It's recognition that physics *describes* a gap—the gap between quantum probabilities and definite outcomes—and asks what fills it. The Map's answer: consciousness. Not understanding the full mechanism of consciousness-quantum interface doesn't make the position incoherent—it may be naturally mysterious (see [mysterianism](/concepts/mysterianism/)). We don't fully understand how mass curves spacetime, yet general relativity is coherent. Similarly, identifying *where* consciousness interacts (at quantum indeterminacies) without fully explaining *how* leaves the framework logically consistent while acknowledging epistemic limits.
