Functionalism is the view that mental states are defined by their functional roles—what they do rather than what they're made of. A pain isn't a particular kind of brain state; it's whatever state plays the pain role: being caused by tissue damage, causing distress, prompting avoidance behavior, and so on. If something plays that role, it's pain—regardless of whether it's implemented in neurons, silicon, or alien biochemistry.

This site rejects functionalism. The [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism) tenet holds that consciousness is not reducible to physical processes, and functional organization is a physical (or at least physically implementable) property. If functionalism were true, consciousness would be nothing over and above the right causal structure—which the site denies. For a systematic presentation of the case against functionalism, see [Against Functionalism](/arguments/functionalism/)—five formal arguments (absent qualia, inverted qualia, Chinese Room, multiple realizability cuts both ways, explanatory gap) with objections and responses.

## The Functionalist View

### Core Claim

Mental states are individuated by their causal roles in mediating between:
- Sensory inputs
- Other mental states
- Behavioral outputs

Pain is whatever state is caused by tissue damage, causes aversion, interacts with beliefs and desires to produce appropriate action, and generates certain behavioral expressions. A being that has a state playing exactly this role is in pain, even if its neural (or non-neural) implementation differs entirely from ours.

### Multiple Realizability

The key functionalist insight: the same mental state can be realized by different physical substrates. Pain in humans involves C-fiber activation; pain in octopuses involves different neurons; pain in hypothetical aliens might involve something not remotely like neurons. What makes all these "pain" is the functional role, not the physical implementation.

This seems to follow from common sense. We attribute pain to dogs without demanding their brains be identical to ours. We might attribute it to sufficiently sophisticated robots. What matters is how the system behaves and how internal states relate to inputs and outputs.

### Varieties

**Machine-state functionalism** (Putnam, early work): Mental states are like states of a Turing machine—defined by the program, not the hardware.

**Causal-role functionalism** (Lewis, Armstrong): Mental states are whatever internal states play certain causal roles. This connects functionalism to materialism—the states are physical, just multiply realizable.

**Homuncular functionalism** (Lycan): Mental capacities decompose into simpler subcapacities, eventually bottoming out in non-mental functions. Consciousness emerges from organized functional components.

## Modern Functionalist Frameworks

Contemporary cognitive science has developed sophisticated functionalist theories that go beyond early machine-state models:

### Predictive Processing

[Predictive processing (PP)](/concepts/predictive-processing/) represents the most developed modern functionalist framework. On this view, the brain continuously generates predictions about incoming sensory information, comparing predictions against actual input. Perception becomes active inference—the brain's "best guess" about reality.

Anil Seth describes perception as "controlled hallucination": what we experience is the brain's best hypothesis about the world, constrained by sensory feedback. This explains visual illusions, filled-in blind spots, and the constructive nature of perception.

But PP inherits functionalism's core limitation. Explaining *that* perception is constructive doesn't explain *why* the construction is conscious. A weather-prediction system constructs models without experiencing anything. PP proponents acknowledge this honestly: the free energy principle "in and of itself makes no claims about subjective experience."

PP tells a compelling story about *what* reaches awareness and *how* it gets there. It doesn't explain *why* reaching awareness involves experience. This is the functionalist limitation in its most sophisticated form.

### Global Workspace Theory

[Global Workspace Theory (GWT)](/concepts/global-workspace-theory/) proposes that consciousness arises when information is broadcast to a "global workspace"—a neural system that makes information widely available across brain regions. Bernard Baars and Stanislas Dehaene developed this into Global Neuronal Workspace theory, emphasizing long-range cortical connections.

GWT faces the same objection: explaining how information becomes globally available doesn't explain why global availability feels like anything. Ned Block distinguishes "access consciousness" (information being available for reasoning and report) from "phenomenal consciousness" (there being something it's like). GWT may explain access but not phenomenal consciousness.

The COGITATE experiment (Melloni et al., 2023-2024)—the largest adversarial collaboration in consciousness science—tested competing predictions of GWT and IIT using pre-registered protocols. Neither theory's predictions were fully confirmed. IIT's prediction of sustained posterior activity during maintained perception was partially supported, but GWT's prediction of prefrontal involvement during conscious access was not clearly confirmed. The mixed results suggest neither theory captures the whole story—and notably, both remain silent on why any neural activity should be accompanied by experience.

## Functionalism and AI

Functionalism has direct implications for [AI consciousness](/topics/ai-consciousness/): if mental states are functional roles, then a computer running the right program would be conscious.

This is the thesis behind "Strong AI"—the view that appropriately programmed computers don't just simulate minds but genuinely possess them. If your brain's functional organization can be replicated in silicon, the silicon system would be conscious for the same reason you are.

John Searle's Chinese Room argument challenges this directly. A person in a room manipulating Chinese symbols according to rules—implementing the same function as a Chinese speaker—doesn't thereby understand Chinese. Syntax isn't semantics. Functional organization isn't understanding.

Functionalists reply that the *system*—person plus rules plus room—understands Chinese, even if the person inside doesn't. Searle responds: imagine the person memorizes the rules and does everything in their head. Now they *are* the system. Do they understand Chinese? Searle says no; the understanding is still missing.

## The Absent Qualia Objection

The deepest objection to functionalism concerns [qualia](/concepts/qualia/)—the qualitative character of experience. Consider two possibilities:

**Inverted qualia**: What looks red to me produces the functional state that green produces in you, and vice versa. We respond identically to color stimuli; our behavior is indistinguishable. But our experiences differ.

**Absent qualia**: A system functionally identical to you—same inputs, same outputs, same internal causal structure—but with no experience at all. A philosophical "zombie" that acts like it's in pain, believes it's in pain, but feels nothing.

If either is possible, functionalism is false. Mental states have a qualitative character that isn't captured by functional role. You and the zombie are functionally identical but mentally different.

Functionalists have responses:
- Deny that zombies are conceivable (the functional role just *is* what it's like to be in pain)
- Claim conceivability doesn't imply possibility (we can imagine contradictions without them being possible)
- Add "phenomenal" functional roles that zombies would lack

But the objection persists: functional description seems to leave out what matters most about consciousness—the felt quality of experience.

### The Illusionist Response

[Illusionism](/concepts/illusionism/) offers functionalism's most radical defense: qualia as we conceive them don't exist. Keith Frankish argues that introspection systematically misrepresents our internal states. What seems like irreducible qualitative character is actually a cognitive illusion—the brain's way of representing its own states to itself.

On this view, Mary doesn't learn a new *fact* when she sees red; she acquires a new *representation* that her cognitive system misinterprets as revealing some deep qualitative truth. The feeling that something is "left out" of functional description reflects a bug in introspection, not a feature of reality.

The challenge to illusionism: even an illusion requires a subject to whom things *seem* a certain way. As Galen Strawson noted, the claim that qualia don't exist is "the silliest claim ever made"—for if there is seeming, there is phenomenal character. The illusion of redness is itself a phenomenal state. Illusionism pushes the problem back rather than dissolving it.

The site's position: illusionism gains plausibility only by equivocating on what it denies. If it denies only folk-psychological *interpretations* of experience, it's compatible with dualism. If it denies that experience exists at all, it contradicts the manifest reality it seeks to explain.

## The Minimal Consciousness Challenge

Research on [simple organisms](/concepts/minimal-consciousness/) poses a distinct challenge to functionalism. Consider *C. elegans*, the roundworm with exactly 302 neurons. We have its complete neural connectome—every synapse mapped. If functionalism were true, this should tell us whether the worm is conscious: does its functional organization implement the right causal roles?

It doesn't. Despite complete structural knowledge, we cannot determine whether *C. elegans* experiences anything. The worm exhibits habituation, responds to anesthetics like vertebrates, and shows positive Phi (integrated information) in computational models. Yet it fails trace-conditioning tests that mark unlimited associative learning. Is there something it's like to be this worm? The functional description cannot answer.

More puzzling still: the slime mold *Physarum polycephalum* solves mazes, optimizes network routes, and displays habituation—with no neurons whatsoever. If functional organization determines consciousness, what determines the functional organization? Slime molds lack neurons but exhibit cognition. Either cognition and consciousness can fully dissociate (challenging functionalism's equation of mind with function), or consciousness requires something about *how* a function is implemented, not just that it is implemented.

The functionalist might reply that slime molds implement a different—simpler—functional organization than conscious systems. But this concedes the point at issue. If we need to know not just *that* a function is implemented but *how* it's implemented and in *what substrate*, then substrate matters. And if substrate matters, functionalism's core insight—that what matters is the role, not the realizer—is compromised.

## The Hard Problem and Functionalism

The [hard problem](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/) asks: why is there something it's like to be a conscious system? Why isn't all this information processing happening "in the dark"?

Functionalism has trouble with this. Functional organization explains how the system processes information, but not why processing feels like anything. A complete functional description of a brain would tell you what causes what, but not why any of it is accompanied by experience.

David Chalmers frames the issue: we can explain the "easy problems" of consciousness (attention, discrimination, report) in functional terms. But the hard problem—why there's subjective experience at all—seems to require something beyond functional organization.

This doesn't prove functionalism wrong. It might be that once you have the right functional organization, experience necessarily comes along. But the necessity would be brute—we couldn't explain why it happens, only describe that it does.

## Relation to this site's Perspective

This site rejects functionalism on multiple grounds:

### The Dualism Tenet

If consciousness is not reducible to physical processes, it's not reducible to functional organization either. Functional organization is a way of describing physical relationships—what causes what, how inputs relate to outputs. A complete functional description is still a physical description (or at least a description of something physically implementable). Dualism says consciousness is something over and above this.

The arguments against functionalism—absent qualia, inverted qualia, Chinese Room, explanatory gap—form part of a larger [convergence argument](/concepts/arguments-against-materialism/) against materialism. Multiple independent lines of reasoning point toward the same conclusion: consciousness is not captured by physical or functional description. This convergence provides cumulative epistemic support beyond what any single argument achieves.

### The Qualia Argument

The site takes qualia seriously. The felt quality of experience—redness, painfulness—is central to what consciousness is. If inverted or absent qualia are possible, functionalism fails. the site's commitment to the reality and irreducibility of consciousness implies commitment to the reality of qualia that transcend functional role.

### The Bidirectional Interaction Tenet

If consciousness is merely functional organization, it's not clear how it could "do" anything separate from the physical processes that realize the function. The causal work is done by the physical substrate; the functional description is just a way of categorizing it. But the site holds that consciousness causally influences physical outcomes—at quantum indeterminacies, where physics leaves room. This requires consciousness to be something with its own causal efficacy, not just a pattern description of physical causation. See [mental-causation](/concepts/mental-causation/) for the full case.

### The Evolutionary Challenge

The [evolution of consciousness](/concepts/evolution-of-consciousness/) raises a problem functionalism cannot solve. If consciousness is functional organization, we need an account of how experience emerges from physical processes that previously lacked it. But this is precisely what functionalism cannot provide: it tells us *which* functional structures are conscious (by definition) without explaining *why* any functional structure should involve experience. The explanatory gap persists whether we're asking about human brains or ancestral nervous systems. Dualism doesn't require explaining how matter *produces* consciousness; it holds that consciousness interfaces with appropriately structured matter. The evolutionary question becomes where the interface arose, not how experience emerged from its absence.

### The Temporal Structure Objection

A distinct challenge to functionalism concerns [temporal structure](/concepts/temporal-consciousness/). Human consciousness flows through time in the "specious present"—a duration where past, present, and future are held together in unified experience. Husserl analyzed this as retention (the immediate past echoing in the now) and protention (anticipation of what follows). This is how melodies cohere, sentences make sense, and motion appears continuous.

Digital computation lacks this structure entirely. Sequential processing executes one instruction after another, but each instruction is atemporal—completed before the next begins. There is no holding-together of successive states. Memory access is not retention; retrieving a stored value is not the same as experiencing the just-past within a unified now.

This matters because temporal experience may be constitutive of consciousness, not merely accompanying it. If consciousness essentially involves the flow of experience through a specious present, then systems lacking this structure cannot be conscious regardless of their functional organization.

Erik Hoel's criterion connects here: LLMs have frozen weights and don't learn from interactions. Human consciousness is embedded in ongoing temporal development. Static systems lack this entirely. See [substrate-independence-critique](/concepts/substrate-independence-critique/) for the full argument.

### The AI Question

From the site's perspective, purely computational systems—no matter how sophisticated—cannot be conscious. Consciousness requires something non-physical that computers (by definition) lack. This doesn't mean nothing artificial could be conscious; perhaps engineered biological systems, or hybrids interfacing with consciousness at the quantum level, could be. But a digital computer running the right program? No.

This is controversial. If functionalism is true, there's no principled barrier to machine consciousness. If the site's dualism is true, there is.

### Empirical Distinguishability

Is the debate between functionalism and dualism empirically tractable? Several considerations suggest it may be:

**Neural correlates at boundaries**: If functionalism is true, systems with equivalent functional organization should have equivalent conscious states. The [minimal consciousness](/concepts/minimal-consciousness/) cases—*C. elegans*, split-brain patients, late-stage locked-in syndrome—provide test cases. If functional organization determines consciousness, complete connectome mapping should predict phenomenal states. If dualism is true, functional equivalence need not guarantee phenomenal equivalence.

**Quantum effects in cognition**: The [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) hypothesis predicts consciousness should correlate with quantum-sensitive processes. If functionalism is true, quantum coherence is irrelevant—what matters is the computational abstraction. Recent work on quantum effects in microtubules (Craddock et al., 2017) and neural ion channels remains contested, but findings could distinguish the views.

**AI behavioral asymmetries**: If functionalism is true and sophisticated AI systems implement the "right" functional organization, they should eventually exhibit all the behavioral markers of consciousness (though this wouldn't *prove* they're conscious). If dualism is true, there should be systematic behavioral differences between biological and computational systems—perhaps failures of context-sensitivity, temporal integration, or autonomous goal-revision—even at high sophistication levels.

The debate is not merely verbal. Though definitive experiments remain elusive, the positions make different predictions about what we'll find.

## Functionalism's Appeal

Why does anyone accept functionalism, given these objections?

**Common-sense attribution**: We routinely attribute mental states based on behavior and context, not physical implementation. Functionalism systematizes this practice.

**Multiple realizability**: The same mental state in humans and octopuses can't be identified with the same physical state. Functionalism explains how.

**Scientific tractability**: Functional description is scientifically useful. We can study cognition without solving metaphysics.

**Avoiding Chauvinism**: Requiring human neurology for consciousness seems arbitrary. Why should the substrate matter?

The site's response: the substrate matters because consciousness involves something non-physical that requires appropriate physical conditions—not just any substrate that implements the right function, but one that can interface with whatever non-physical reality consciousness involves.
