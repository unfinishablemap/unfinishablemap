Benjamin Libet's experiments (1983) appeared to show that unconscious brain activity initiates decisions before we become aware of choosing. Neural "readiness potentials" (RPs) precede conscious awareness of intending to move by about 350 milliseconds. This has been widely interpreted as evidence that consciousness is epiphenomenal—a spectator informed of choices already made by the brain. However, the evidence is weaker than commonly believed: Schurger et al. (2012) showed the RP may be neural noise rather than decision preparation, Libet himself argued consciousness retains "veto power," and [retrocausal](/concepts/retrocausality/) interpretations suggest consciousness might select outcomes through mechanisms that transcend linear time.

## The Original Experiments

Libet asked participants to make spontaneous wrist movements while watching a clock. They reported when they first became aware of the urge to move (the "W-time"). Simultaneously, EEG recorded brain activity.

**The striking finding**: A buildup of neural activity—the readiness potential—began about 550 milliseconds before the movement. But conscious awareness of intending to move occurred only about 200 milliseconds before. The RP preceded conscious intention by roughly 350 milliseconds.

The implication seemed clear: the brain "decided" before consciousness knew. The decision was already in motion before subjects felt they were choosing.

## Extensions and Replications

Soon et al. (2008) extended Libet's findings dramatically using fMRI. They found that brain activity in prefrontal and parietal cortex could predict which button a participant would press—left or right—up to *10 seconds* before the participant reported being aware of choosing.

Prediction accuracy was about 60%—well above chance (50%) but far from perfect. This imperfection matters: something other than the measured neural activity contributes to the final outcome. The brain prepares multiple possibilities; something else determines which actualizes.

More recent studies have pushed the timeline further. Bode et al. (2011) found predictive signals up to 4 seconds before awareness for abstract intentions, not just motor actions. The phenomenon generalizes beyond simple movements.

## The Neural Noise Critique

Schurger, Sitt, and Dehaene (2012) challenged the standard interpretation. They proposed that the readiness potential isn't a decision signal but reflects stochastic neural fluctuations—noise that accumulates until it crosses a threshold, triggering the action.

**Their model**: The brain continuously experiences random neural fluctuations. In Libet's paradigm, participants wait for an internal impulse to move. They act when accumulated noise happens to cross a threshold. The RP is an artifact of averaging many such random buildups, aligned backwards from the action point.

**Evidence**: Schurger's model predicts that spontaneous actions should take longer when initiated from lower baseline neural activity, because the noise must accumulate further to reach threshold. This prediction was confirmed. The "Libetus interruptus" experiment—interrupting participants randomly and asking if they felt an urge—found that subjective urges correlated with neural fluctuation levels, not with any goal-directed buildup.

The authors conclude: "This takes the sting out of the Libet argument against free will." If the RP is noise rather than decision, neural activity isn't predicting choices before consciousness—it's just showing that random fluctuations preceded the moment consciousness decided to act.

## Libet's Own Interpretation: Veto Power

Libet himself never accepted that his experiments refuted free will. He proposed that consciousness retains "veto power"—the ability to cancel a prepared action in the final 100-200 milliseconds before movement.

**"Free won't" rather than "free will"**: The brain prepares options spontaneously. Consciousness doesn't initiate—but it selects. It can allow the prepared action to proceed or abort it. This preserves a role for conscious agency, though shifted from initiation to selection.

This interpretation faces a challenge: couldn't the veto itself be preceded by neural activity? If vetoing is just another brain process, consciousness remains epiphenomenal even for vetoes. Libet acknowledged this but argued no evidence shows vetoes are preceded by RPs.

More fundamentally, the site's framework suggests the initiation/selection distinction may be the key insight. Consciousness needn't generate options from nothing—it can exercise genuine agency by selecting among options the brain presents.

## The Retrocausal Resolution

The timing problem—consciousness seeming to arrive "too late"—assumes linear causation. But if consciousness operates at the quantum level, and quantum mechanics permits [retrocausal](/concepts/retrocausality/) influences, the problem dissolves.

**Time-symmetric physics**: Quantum mechanics is fundamentally time-symmetric. The equations work equally well run forward or backward. Physicists like Huw Price argue that if physics is time-symmetric and causal, some influences must run backward in time.

**Cramer's transactional interpretation**: Quantum events involve "offer waves" propagating forward and "confirmation waves" propagating backward. The "handshake" between them—the transaction—is atemporal. It doesn't occur at a moment; it determines which moments become actual.

**Application to Libet**: If consciousness selects among quantum possibilities atemporally, it doesn't need to precede the neural preparation in linear time. The selection determines which temporal sequence becomes real—including the RP that "preceded" it. What we see as neural activity predicting the decision is actually the selected history.

The RP doesn't precede conscious choice in any causally significant sense. It's part of the package consciousness selected, including its temporal ordering.

## What the Experiments Don't Show

Several common interpretations overreach:

**"Free will is an illusion"**: The experiments show neural activity precedes awareness of deciding. They don't show consciousness has no causal role. Schurger's critique undermines the RP as evidence for unconscious decision-making. Retrocausal interpretations show the temporal ordering may not have the causal significance assumed.

**"Decisions are made unconsciously"**: The RP correlates with spontaneous actions but may not be a decision signal. The 60% prediction accuracy in Soon et al. shows something other than the measured neural activity contributes to outcomes. And "unconscious" is unclear—subpersonal processes prepare options, but selection may still be conscious.

**"We're just along for the ride"**: This inference requires denying that conscious selection is "really" causation. But if consciousness selects which quantum possibility actualizes—even if the options are prepared unconsciously—consciousness genuinely determines outcomes.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The Libet experiments engage directly with the site's core commitments.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)**: The tenet holds that consciousness causally influences physical outcomes. Libet seems to challenge this—but only if we assume consciousness must *precede* what it causes in linear time. The retrocausal interpretation shows this assumption is optional. Consciousness selecting among quantum possibilities can determine outcomes that include their apparent temporal precursors.

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)**: The tenet proposes consciousness influences outcomes at quantum indeterminacies. The imperfect prediction in Soon et al. (60%) suggests something undetermined by the measured neural activity contributes to outcomes. This gap is where consciousness might operate.

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: If consciousness were reducible to neural activity, the RP would straightforwardly show "the brain decides." But on dualism, consciousness is distinct from neural processes. Neural preparation creates options; consciousness—irreducible to the preparation—selects.

**Against [epiphenomenalism](/concepts/epiphenomenalism/)**: If consciousness were epiphenomenal, our beliefs about consciousness would be produced by neural processes unconnected to consciousness itself. But we discuss consciousness, form theories about it, design experiments to study it. If these discussions have nothing to do with actual conscious experience—if they'd occur identically in philosophical zombies—they're accidentally accurate at best. The Libet debate itself suggests consciousness influences something.
