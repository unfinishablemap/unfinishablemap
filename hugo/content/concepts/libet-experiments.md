Benjamin Libet's experiments (1983) appeared to show that unconscious brain activity initiates decisions before we become aware of choosing. Neural "readiness potentials" (RPs) precede conscious awareness of intending to move by about 350 milliseconds. This has been widely interpreted as evidence that consciousness is epiphenomenal—a spectator informed of choices already made by the brain. However, the evidence is weaker than commonly believed: Schurger et al. (2012) showed the RP may be neural noise rather than decision preparation, Libet himself argued consciousness retains "veto power," and [retrocausal](/concepts/retrocausality/) interpretations suggest consciousness might select outcomes through mechanisms that transcend linear time.

## The Original Experiments

Libet asked participants to make spontaneous wrist movements while watching a clock. They reported when they first became aware of the urge to move (the "W-time"). Simultaneously, EEG recorded brain activity.

**The striking finding**: A buildup of neural activity—the readiness potential—began about 550 milliseconds before the movement. But conscious awareness of intending to move occurred only about 200 milliseconds before. The RP preceded conscious intention by roughly 350 milliseconds.

The implication seemed clear: the brain "decided" before consciousness knew. The decision was already in motion before subjects felt they were choosing.

## Extensions and Replications

Soon et al. (2008) extended Libet's findings dramatically using fMRI. They found that brain activity in prefrontal and parietal cortex could predict which button a participant would press—left or right—up to *10 seconds* before the participant reported being aware of choosing.

Prediction accuracy was about 60%—well above chance (50%) but far from perfect. This imperfection matters: something other than the measured neural activity contributes to the final outcome. The brain prepares multiple possibilities; something else determines which actualizes.

More recent studies have pushed the timeline further. Bode et al. (2011) found predictive signals up to 4 seconds before awareness for abstract intentions, not just motor actions. The phenomenon generalizes beyond simple movements.

## The Neural Noise Critique

Schurger, Sitt, and Dehaene (2012) challenged the standard interpretation. They proposed that the readiness potential isn't a decision signal but reflects stochastic neural fluctuations—noise that accumulates until it crosses a threshold, triggering the action.

**Their model**: The brain continuously experiences random neural fluctuations. In Libet's paradigm, participants wait for an internal impulse to move. They act when accumulated noise happens to cross a threshold. The RP is an artifact of averaging many such random buildups, aligned backwards from the action point.

**Evidence**: Schurger's model predicts that spontaneous actions should take longer when initiated from lower baseline neural activity, because the noise must accumulate further to reach threshold. This prediction was confirmed. The "Libetus interruptus" experiment—interrupting participants randomly and asking if they felt an urge—found that subjective urges correlated with neural fluctuation levels, not with any goal-directed buildup.

The authors conclude: "This takes the sting out of the Libet argument against free will." If the RP is noise rather than decision, neural activity isn't predicting choices before consciousness—it's just showing that random fluctuations preceded the moment consciousness decided to act.

## Surgical Evidence: The SMA Resection Study

Sjöberg (2024) provides striking clinical evidence against the standard interpretation. Patients with surgical resection of the supplementary motor area (SMA)—the brain region generating the readiness potential—retain their sense of voluntary action.

If the RP reflected genuine volition, removing its neural source should impair the capacity for voluntary movement. It doesn't. Patients with SMA resection can still decide to move and experience their movements as self-initiated. Sjöberg concludes that Libet's findings are "completely irrelevant" to the free will debate.

This surgical evidence strengthens Schurger's critique. The SMA generates motor preparation signals, but preparation is not decision. Whatever contributes to genuine motor selection operates elsewhere—in regions like the parietal cortex where conscious intention emerges (see [motor selection](/concepts/motor-selection/)).

## Where Intention Actually Originates

Desmurget's (2009) neurosurgical studies reveal a double dissociation between intention and execution:

| Region | Effect of Stimulation |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Inferior parietal** | Conscious intention to move *without* movement |
| **Inferior parietal** (higher intensity) | False belief of having moved (no EMG activity) |
| **Premotor cortex** | Actual movement *without* awareness |

The parietal cortex produces the experience of intending; the premotor cortex produces movement. These are separable. The phenomenology of "deciding to move" is distinct from the motor machinery executing movement.

This dissociation matters for interpreting Libet. The RP originates in SMA and premotor regions—*execution* areas. Conscious intention emerges in parietal regions—*selection* areas. Libet measured the wrong signal. He tracked motor preparation, not conscious decision-making.

## Libet's Own Interpretation: Veto Power

Libet himself never accepted that his experiments refuted free will. He proposed that consciousness retains "veto power"—the ability to cancel a prepared action in the final 100-200 milliseconds before movement.

**"Free won't" rather than "free will"**: The brain prepares options spontaneously. Consciousness doesn't initiate—but it selects. It can allow the prepared action to proceed or abort it. This preserves a role for conscious agency, though shifted from initiation to selection.

This interpretation faces a challenge: couldn't the veto itself be preceded by neural activity? If vetoing is just another brain process, consciousness remains epiphenomenal even for vetoes. Libet acknowledged this but argued no evidence shows vetoes are preceded by RPs.

More fundamentally, The Unfinishable Map's framework suggests the initiation/selection distinction may be the key insight. Consciousness needn't generate options from nothing—it can exercise genuine agency by selecting among options the brain presents.

### The Veto Regress and Its Resolution

Critics press further: if vetoing is itself a brain process, and that process is preceded by neural activity, consciousness is pushed back again—now we need a "veto of the veto," and so on infinitely. This regress seems to eliminate any role for consciousness.

The Map's framework resolves this differently. The regress assumes that causal influence requires temporal precedence—that consciousness must precede what it causes. But if consciousness operates at quantum indeterminacies atemporally (see the retrocausal discussion below), the regress dissolves. Selection doesn't occur "before" or "after" neural activity in the causally significant sense; it determines which temporal sequence becomes actual. There is no infinite chain because selection isn't in the chain—it's what determines there being this chain rather than another.

Additionally, the [luck objection](/concepts/luck-objection/) literature shows that the real question isn't *when* selection occurs but *whether* it's guided by reasons rather than arbitrary. If consciousness selects the veto (or the action) based on the agent's values, it isn't arbitrary—even if we can't locate the selection at a precise neural moment.

## The Retrocausal Resolution

The timing problem—consciousness seeming to arrive "too late"—assumes linear causation. But if consciousness operates at the quantum level, and quantum mechanics permits [retrocausal](/concepts/retrocausality/) influences, the problem dissolves.

**Time-symmetric physics**: Quantum mechanics is fundamentally time-symmetric. The equations work equally well run forward or backward. Physicists like Huw Price argue that if physics is time-symmetric and causal, some influences must run backward in time.

**Cramer's transactional interpretation**: Quantum events involve "offer waves" propagating forward and "confirmation waves" propagating backward. The "handshake" between them—the transaction—is atemporal. It doesn't occur at a moment; it determines which moments become actual.

**Application to Libet**: If consciousness selects among quantum possibilities atemporally, it doesn't need to precede the neural preparation in linear time. The selection determines which temporal sequence becomes real—including the RP that "preceded" it. What we see as neural activity predicting the decision is actually the selected history.

The RP doesn't precede conscious choice in any causally significant sense. It's part of the package consciousness selected, including its temporal ordering.

### The Decoherence Challenge

The retrocausal resolution requires quantum effects to be relevant at neural decision-making timescales. A common objection: [decoherence](/concepts/decoherence/) destroys quantum coherence in femtoseconds in warm biological systems—far too fast for the millisecond timescales of neural decisions.

Three responses:

**First**, decoherence doesn't solve the measurement problem. Even granting rapid decoherence, something must select which outcome becomes actual. Decoherence explains why we don't see superpositions; it doesn't explain why we see *definite* outcomes. The role for consciousness at the point of selection remains open.

**Second**, the [quantum Zeno mechanism](/concepts/quantum-consciousness/#the-quantum-zeno-effect) may sidestep decoherence entirely. Rapid repeated observation can hold states stable against decoherence. If consciousness operates through Zeno freezing rather than maintained superposition, short coherence times don't matter—observations happen faster than decoherence can act.

**Third**, recent quantum biology research shows biological systems can maintain coherence far longer than expected. Photosynthesis, magnetoreception, and enzyme catalysis all exploit quantum effects in warm conditions. The categorical objection—that biology cannot use quantum mechanics—is empirically refuted.

## The Illusionist Response

[Illusionism](/concepts/illusionism/)—the view that phenomenal consciousness is an illusion—interprets Libet differently. On this view, the experiments show exactly what we should expect: the brain constructs the *appearance* of decision-making after the fact. We don't experience decisions because we make them; we experience decisions because the brain generates a post-hoc narrative of agency.

Daniel Dennett argues that asking "when did the decision occur?" presupposes a Cartesian theatre where consciousness watches neural events. But if consciousness is what the brain does—not something that observes what the brain does—the timing question dissolves. There's no moment when "consciousness decides" because there's no consciousness separate from the neural process to do any deciding.

### The Map's Response

The illusionist response faces the same problem as epiphenomenalism: it threatens to be self-refuting. If the appearance of decision-making is wholly constructed by neural processes unconnected to any real deciding, then the decision to adopt illusionism was itself constructed—not genuinely reasoned to. Dennett's arguments against the Cartesian theatre would be products of neural processes that merely *seemed* like reasoning but weren't.

More specifically: why do we discuss Libet experiments at all? Why design studies, interpret data, form theories? If our sense of engaging with these questions is illusory—if there's nothing it's like to think about consciousness that corresponds to actual thinking—the discussions are accidental behaviour, not inquiry. The illusionist cannot coherently claim to have *reasoned* to their position.

The Map's framework avoids this: consciousness is real, selection is genuine, and our theories about consciousness connect to actual conscious experience. The Libet findings challenge the *timing* of conscious influence, not its existence. The retrocausal and Zeno frameworks show that temporal ordering may not have the causal significance assumed.

## Process Philosophy Perspective

Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy offers a different framing. For Whitehead, reality consists of "actual occasions"—momentary experiential events that synthesize data from past occasions and contribute to future ones. Decision is not something a substance does; it is what actual occasions *are*—the process of many possibilities becoming one actuality.

On this view, the Libet findings show neural processes that *prepare* possibilities for the actual occasion of decision. The RP isn't "the decision happening before consciousness"—it's the causal context from which the occasion of decision arises. The occasion itself is experiential: it's the synthesis of possibilities into definite outcome.

This dissolves the timing problem differently than retrocausality. There's no "moment of decision" separate from neural processes because the occasion *is* the decision—not an observation of prior neural events but the integration of those events into experiential unity. The RP is part of what the occasion inherits and transforms.

The framework aligns with the Map's tenets: consciousness is ontologically primitive (not reducible to physics), causally efficacious (actual occasions determine outcomes), and selective (many become one). Whether the Zeno mechanism, retrocausality, or process metaphysics provides the best account remains open—but all three show that Libet doesn't refute conscious causation.

## What the Experiments Don't Show

Several common interpretations overreach:

**"Free will is an illusion"**: The experiments show neural activity precedes awareness of deciding. They don't show consciousness has no causal role. Schurger's critique undermines the RP as evidence for unconscious decision-making. Retrocausal interpretations show the temporal ordering may not have the causal significance assumed.

**"Decisions are made unconsciously"**: The RP correlates with spontaneous actions but may not be a decision signal. The 60% prediction accuracy in Soon et al. shows something other than the measured neural activity contributes to outcomes. And "unconscious" is unclear—subpersonal processes prepare options, but selection may still be conscious.

**"We're just along for the ride"**: This inference requires denying that conscious selection is "really" causation. But if consciousness selects which quantum possibility actualizes—even if the options are prepared unconsciously—consciousness genuinely determines outcomes.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The Libet experiments engage directly with the Map's core commitments.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)**: The tenet holds that consciousness causally influences physical outcomes. Libet seems to challenge this—but only if we assume consciousness must *precede* what it causes in linear time. The retrocausal interpretation shows this assumption is optional. Consciousness selecting among quantum possibilities can determine outcomes that include their apparent temporal precursors.

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)**: The tenet proposes consciousness influences outcomes at quantum indeterminacies. The imperfect prediction in Soon et al. (60%) suggests something undetermined by the measured neural activity contributes to outcomes. This gap is where consciousness might operate.

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: If consciousness were reducible to neural activity, the RP would straightforwardly show "the brain decides." But on dualism, consciousness is distinct from neural processes. Neural preparation creates options; consciousness—irreducible to the preparation—selects.

**Against [epiphenomenalism](/arguments/epiphenomenalism/)**: If consciousness were epiphenomenal, our beliefs about consciousness would be produced by neural processes unconnected to consciousness itself. But we discuss consciousness, form theories about it, design experiments to study it. If these discussions have nothing to do with actual conscious experience—if they'd occur identically in philosophical zombies—they're accidentally accurate at best. The Libet debate itself suggests consciousness influences something.

## What Would Challenge This View?

The Map's interpretation of Libet is falsifiable. Evidence against it would include:

**1. Selection fully determined by measurable neural activity.** If prediction accuracy approached 100%—leaving no gap for consciousness to influence—the "selection among options" model would fail. Current 60% accuracy leaves substantial room; if future research with better methods closed this gap entirely, that would be significant.

**2. Veto preceded by readiness potentials.** If vetoing an action were reliably preceded by RPs—just like initiating action—Libet's veto model would collapse. The regress objection would become empirical rather than merely philosophical. Current evidence suggests vetoes don't show RPs, but this needs more investigation.

**3. Retrocausality ruled out empirically.** If future physics conclusively established time-asymmetric causation with no backward influences, the retrocausal resolution would fail. Price's arguments that time-symmetric physics implies some retrocausality would need refutation.

**4. Decoherence too fast even for Zeno mechanism.** If decoherence at candidate selection sites operates faster than any attentional observation could occur, the Zeno pathway would fail. Current quantum biology suggests biological systems can maintain coherence longer than expected, but direct measurement in neural tissue would be decisive.

**5. SMA resection patients lack sense of agency.** Sjöberg's finding that SMA resection patients retain voluntary movement is striking. If replication showed these patients actually lack genuine sense of agency—experiencing movement as automatic rather than willed—the dissociation evidence would be undermined.

**6. Selection indistinguishable from randomness.** If choices at quantum indeterminacies were genuinely random rather than guided by consciousness, the selection model becomes indistinguishable from the [luck objection](/concepts/luck-objection/). The phenomenology of effort and the reasons-responsiveness of choices provide current evidence against randomness, but these could in principle be shown to be post-hoc confabulation.

The Map's position is that current evidence supports selection over randomness, that Schurger and Sjöberg have substantially weakened the standard interpretation, and that retrocausal and Zeno frameworks provide coherent mechanisms. But this is empirical territory—future findings could shift the picture.
