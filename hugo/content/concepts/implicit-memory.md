When you ride a bicycle, tie your shoes, or type on a keyboard, you act without reflective awareness. The skill executes smoothly; you don't observe yourself executing it. You don't mentally replay the lessons where you learned, nor do you consciously retrieve rules about pedal pressure or keystroke sequences. The knowledge is simply expressed in fluent action. This is implicit memory—knowledge that shows in performance rather than conscious recollection.

Implicit memory matters for the project's framework because it reveals consciousness as an *interface* that can delegate to procedural systems. Endel Tulving associated implicit memory with *anoetic consciousness*: awareness without self-knowledge, action without reflection. Crucially, when consciousness forcibly re-engages with automatized skills—when you attend to your typing or think about your footwork—performance typically *degrades*. This "choking under pressure" phenomenon provides direct evidence for [bidirectional interaction](/concepts/mental-causation/): consciousness causally affects procedural execution, sometimes disruptively. If consciousness were epiphenomenal, attending to skills couldn't interfere with them.

## Tulving's Anoetic Consciousness

Endel Tulving (1927-2023) distinguished three forms of consciousness associated with different memory systems, forming a hierarchy from unreflective action to temporal self-projection.

**Anoetic consciousness** ("non-knowing") accompanies procedural and implicit memory. When you perform a well-learned skill, there is no self-reference, no sense of yourself as the subject of experience observing yourself act. The skill simply executes. Tulving emphasised that anoetic consciousness is not *absent* consciousness but a distinct mode—what he called "non-reflective qualia." There is still something it is like to ride a bicycle expertly; it just doesn't involve representing yourself as the one riding.

**Noetic consciousness** ("knowing") accompanies [semantic memory](/concepts/semantic-memory/). You are aware of knowing—you know that Paris is in France—but without re-experiencing when you learned it. The fact is simply available.

**Autonoetic consciousness** ("self-knowing") accompanies [episodic memory](/concepts/autonoetic-consciousness/). You don't merely know facts about your past; you mentally travel back and re-experience events, phenomenally present as both current rememberer and past protagonist.

The hierarchy matters: anoetic consciousness provides the phenomenal foundation that higher forms build upon. Even the most automatic action has experiential character, however unreflective. The question is not whether there is experience, but what *kind* of experience accompanies different cognitive modes.

## Skill Acquisition and the Dreyfus Model

The Dreyfus model of skill acquisition charts how consciousness relates to procedural memory across development, describing a progression from rule-following to intuition that illuminates the [interface hypothesis](/concepts/attention-as-interface/).

### Five Stages

**Novice**: Follows explicit rules without situational context. Learning to drive, you consciously follow "check mirrors, signal, check blind spot" sequences. Every action requires [deliberate attention](/concepts/mental-effort/).

**Advanced beginner**: Recognises situational patterns through experience. You notice the feel of "too fast for this curve" without calculating speeds.

**Competent**: Chooses among rules and perspectives, takes responsibility for outcomes. Conscious planning and emotional investment emerge.

**Proficient**: Sees situations holistically, knows intuitively what to do, but still thinks analytically about how. The "what" becomes automatic; the "how" requires attention.

**Expert**: Acts fluidly without deliberation. Experts "do what normally works" without reflective decision-making. Chess masters don't calculate positions—they see good moves.

### The Transition to Automaticity

The key phenomenological transition occurs between competent and expert performance. Initially, skills require conscious attention at every step. Gradually, consciousness *withdraws* from execution details while retaining oversight capacity. The expert doesn't lose awareness—they enter the anoetic mode where action flows without self-observation.

This withdrawal is not elimination. Consciousness delegates to procedural systems but retains the ability to re-engage. The expert driver notices the unusual road surface and shifts attention; the expert typist catches the error and consciously corrects. The interface can re-engage—and this re-engagement has consequences, as the choking phenomenon reveals.

## Choking Under Pressure: Evidence for Bidirectional Interaction

When skilled performers face high-pressure situations, a counterintuitive breakdown occurs: conscious attention to automatized skills *degrades* performance. The expert golfer thinking about their swing, the concert pianist monitoring their finger placement, the skilled speaker attending to their pronunciation—all perform worse than when acting without self-focus.

### The Explicit Monitoring Theory

Baumeister and Beilock's explicit monitoring theory explains choking: pressure generates anxiety, anxiety triggers self-focus, and self-focus leads to step-by-step monitoring of what should be automatic execution. The performer "reinvests" explicit control in procedures that work better without it. Crucially, this reinvestment involves [willed attention](/concepts/voluntary-attention/)—not mere stimulus-driven capture, but internally directed focus on one's own movements. The performer *decides* to attend to their execution, and this decision has causal consequences.

Research confirms this pattern:
- Highly skilled performers choke more than moderately skilled ones (they have more to disrupt)
- Skills learned without explicit awareness are protected against choking
- Dual-task conditions that occupy conscious attention can *improve* skilled performance
- Instructions to focus on outcomes rather than mechanics reduce choking

### Why This Matters for Dualism

Choking provides direct evidence for [consciousness causally affecting](/concepts/mental-causation/) brain processes. Consider the causal chain:

1. Conscious attention shifts to procedural execution
2. Procedural execution is disrupted
3. Performance degrades

If consciousness were [epiphenomenal](/arguments/epiphenomenalism/)—a mere byproduct with no causal power—step 2 couldn't follow from step 1. The fact that *attending to skills interferes with them* shows consciousness isn't causally inert. The attention has effects.

This evidence is particularly strong because the effect is *negative*. One might explain away reports of conscious agency as post-hoc confabulation. But why would a causally inert consciousness generate systematic *interference*? The choking phenomenon requires that conscious attention genuinely does something—something the procedural system would rather it didn't do.

## Body Memory and the Interface

Embodied cognition theorists, following Merleau-Ponty, argue that body memory refutes Cartesian dualism. The body has its own knowing—neither purely mental nor purely physical. Skills are embodied; they resist the mind/body split.

### The Apparent Challenge

Merleau-Ponty wrote that body memory is "an impressive refutation of the dualism of pure consciousness and the physical body." The skilled pianist's fingers "know" the piece in a way irreducible to either mental representation or mere muscle movement. [Embodied cognition](/concepts/embodied-cognition/) theorists use such examples to argue that consciousness cannot be separated from bodily engagement.

### The Interface Response

the project's framework accommodates this insight without abandoning dualism. The point isn't that consciousness floats free of the body—clearly it doesn't. The point is that consciousness *interfaces* with bodily systems at specific sites and can modulate their operation.

Body memory reveals *where* the interface operates, not that consciousness is identical to the body. The expert's embodied skill represents successful delegation: consciousness has calibrated the procedural system and now need not intervene. But the retention of override capacity—shown precisely by choking when attention re-engages—reveals the interface remains operative.

Embodied cognition challenges a crude dualism where consciousness is wholly separate from matter. It doesn't challenge the interface dualism where consciousness *interacts with* matter through attentional engagement. The body's implicit knowing is the result of consciousness having trained and delegated to procedural systems, not evidence that consciousness was never distinct from them.

## Implicit Learning and Awareness

A deeper question: does implicit learning occur without *any* form of awareness? Research on priming, conditioning, and subliminal perception suggests learning can occur without explicit awareness of what was learned.

### The Evidence

- **Priming**: Processing a stimulus facilitates processing of related stimuli, even when the prime was presented below awareness thresholds
- **Conditioning**: Emotional responses can develop to stimuli never consciously perceived
- **Blindsight**: Brain-damaged patients navigate obstacles they report not seeing

### The Interpretation

Some interpret this as evidence for genuinely unconscious cognition—processing without any experiential dimension. But the project's framework, following Tulving, suggests caution. "Implicit" may describe *access* rather than *phenomenology*. The learning may involve anoetic consciousness—experiential but non-reflective—rather than no experience at all.

The distinction matters. If implicit learning has phenomenal character, however unreflective, then consciousness pervades cognition more deeply than functionalist accounts suggest. There may be no purely computational cognitive processing—every operation occurs within some experiential mode, even if not the self-aware mode we ordinarily call "conscious."

## Relation to Site Perspective

Implicit memory illuminates all five tenets.

### Dualism
Even Tulving's anoetic consciousness has phenomenal character—"non-reflective qualia." There is something it is like to perform automatized skills, however different from reflective experience. Consciousness isn't identical to self-aware cognition; it includes unreflective modes that procedural memory operates within.

### Minimal Quantum Interaction
The [attention interface](/concepts/attention-as-interface/) explains why consciousness can delegate: once skills are calibrated, the low-bandwidth interface need not continuously engage. Procedural systems run on trained patterns; consciousness intervenes only when selection among alternatives is required.

### Bidirectional Interaction
Choking provides the clearest evidence. Conscious attention to automatized skills disrupts execution. This causal interference—consciousness affecting procedural processing—couldn't occur if consciousness were epiphenomenal.

### No Many Worlds
Skill execution involves selecting among action possibilities. If [all possibilities actualised](/arguments/many-worlds/), skilled performance couldn't be coherent—every possible action would occur. The single actualised trajectory of expert performance requires genuine selection.

### Occam's Razor Has Limits
Eliminating consciousness from accounts of skill acquisition can't explain choking. The simplest account that covers the phenomena requires consciousness as a causal factor that can interfere with procedural execution—not just accompany it.
