Direction of fit is a classification of mental states according to how they relate to the world. Beliefs have *mind-to-world* direction of fit: when a belief conflicts with reality, the belief is at fault and should change. Desires have *world-to-mind* direction of fit: when reality conflicts with a desire, reality is at fault and should change. This asymmetry, introduced by Elizabeth Anscombe in 1957 and developed by John Searle in 1983, reveals something fundamental about [intentionality](/concepts/intentionality/)—and about whether consciousness can be causally inert.

The Unfinishable Map holds that direction of fit, particularly the world-to-mind variety, provides evidence for the [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet. If desires and intentions genuinely aim at restructuring the world, then mental states exercise causal influence over physical outcomes. Epiphenomenalism struggles to account for this.

## Anscombe's Original Distinction

Anscombe introduced direction of fit through an analogy in *Intention* (1957). Imagine a detective following a shopper through a store, writing down everything the shopper buys. Both end up with identical lists. But the lists have different directions of fit.

The detective's list should match what the shopper actually buys. If the list says "butter" but the shopper bought margarine, the *list* is wrong. This is mind-to-world fit: the representation adapts to reality.

The shopper's list specifies what to buy. If the shopper buys margarine but the list says "butter," the *shopper* has erred—reality (the purchase) should match the list. This is world-to-mind fit: reality adapts to the representation.

The crucial insight is that the same propositional content ("butter is purchased") can relate to the world in fundamentally different ways depending on whether the state aims to *reflect* or *reshape* reality.

## Searle's Development

Searle systematised direction of fit in *Intentionality* (1983), extending the framework across mental state types:

**Mind-to-world fit**: Beliefs, perceptions, memories. These states are satisfied when they accurately represent how the world is. A false belief fails on its own terms.

**World-to-mind fit**: Desires, intentions, commands. These states are satisfied when the world comes to match their content. An unfulfilled desire does not misrepresent—it sets a standard reality has yet to meet.

**Double direction**: Some states exhibit both directions simultaneously. Searle argued that intentions-in-action have both: they represent the action being performed (mind-to-world) while causing that very action (world-to-mind).

**Null direction**: Some mental states—emotions like undirected anxiety, moods—may lack a clear direction of fit. They do not aim to represent the world accurately, nor do they aim to change it.

Searle connected direction of fit to his broader theory of [intentionality](/concepts/intentionality/) and speech acts. Assertions have mind-to-world fit (like beliefs); commands and promises have world-to-mind fit (like desires). The direction of fit of a speech act derives from the underlying intentional state it expresses.

## The Normative Dimension

Direction of fit is not merely descriptive but *normative*. A belief that fails to match the world is not just different from reality—it is defective. It *ought* to change. A desire whose object is not realised is not defective in the same way. The world *ought* to change (or so the desire "says").

This normativity is difficult to capture in purely physical terms. Neural circuits do implement error signals and correction mechanisms that track reliability—Bayesian updating, prediction error minimisation, synaptic adjustment. These implement normative-like structure. But the *phenomenal* dimension of normativity—the felt sense that a belief is *wrong*, the experienced pull of a desire toward its object—is not obviously captured by describing these mechanisms. The gap parallels the broader [explanatory gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/): just as describing neural correlates does not entail phenomenal experience, describing error-correction circuitry does not entail that a state *ought* to match reality.

If [phenomenal intentionality theory](/concepts/phenomenal-intentionality/) is correct and genuine intentional content requires phenomenal consciousness, then direction of fit inherits this requirement. The normative structure of mental states—the way beliefs *should* track truth and desires *should* guide action—may be grounded in phenomenal character rather than functional role alone.

## World-to-Mind Fit and Mental Causation

The world-to-mind direction of fit carries special weight for the mind-body problem. Desires and intentions aim to *change reality*. When you intend to raise your arm, the content of the intention specifies a state of affairs that does not yet obtain, and the intention functions to bring that state about.

For this to work, the intentional state must be causally efficacious. The intention must actually cause the arm to rise. If mental states with world-to-mind fit are [epiphenomenal](/concepts/epiphenomenalism/)—causally inert accompaniments of neural activity—then their directedness toward changing the world is an illusion. They "aim" at nothing because they do nothing.

The Map's [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet takes world-to-mind fit at face value. When consciousness holds a representation of a desired state and acts to bring it about, the phenomenal content guides physical outcomes. The [aesthetic creation](/topics/consciousness-and-aesthetic-creation/) case makes this vivid: the painter holds a phenomenal template (world-to-mind fit) and reshapes canvas to match, with continuous phenomenal feedback (mind-to-world fit) guiding each stroke.

The [placebo effect](/topics/placebo-effect-and-mental-causation/) provides suggestive empirical evidence. When a patient believes a treatment will reduce pain, the belief's content—what it is *about*—correlates with which physiological cascades activate. A physicalist can attribute this content-specificity to neural patterns rather than irreducible mental content. But the direction-of-fit framing sharpens the puzzle: the belief's representational content (mind-to-world) appears to initiate world-to-mind causal chains in the body, and whether neural implementation fully accounts for this content-dependence remains contested.

## Direction of Fit and Agent Causation

[Agent causation](/concepts/agent-causation/) gains clarity through the lens of direction of fit. When an agent acts, they exercise world-to-mind fit: they hold an intention whose content specifies a not-yet-actual state of affairs, and they cause that state to become actual. This is precisely what substances exercising causal powers looks like from the intentional perspective.

Event-causal theories struggle here. If desires are just neural events causing other neural events, the "direction" of fit becomes metaphorical—one physical event leading to another, with no genuine normative relation between representation and world. Agent causation preserves the literal directedness: the agent genuinely intends a future state and brings it about through the exercise of causal power.

The double direction of fit in intentions-in-action is particularly telling. When you are in the process of raising your arm, your intention both represents the arm rising (mind-to-world) and causes the arm to rise (world-to-mind). This simultaneous bidirectionality maps onto the Map's picture: consciousness both registers physical states (perception) and selects among possible physical outcomes (action).

## Challenges to the Framework

**The biological objection**: Some argue direction of fit reduces to biological function. Beliefs have mind-to-world fit because organisms that form accurate representations survive; desires have world-to-mind fit because organisms that act on motivational states reproduce. On this view, direction of fit is an evolutionary story, not a mark of irreducibility. The Map's response: evolutionary function may explain *why* these structures exist without explaining *what they are*. The normative dimension—that beliefs *should* match reality—is not captured by the historical fact that accurate representation was adaptive.

**The functionalist reduction**: Functionalists can define direction of fit structurally: mind-to-world states are those revised in response to perceptual input; world-to-mind states are those that generate action. No phenomenal consciousness needed. This structural account captures the *relational asymmetry* between beliefs and desires. But it faces the same challenge that [functionalism](/concepts/functionalism/) faces generally: structure without qualitative character may be structure without genuine normativity. A thermostat revises its state in response to temperature (mind-to-world analogue) and activates heating to change the environment (world-to-mind analogue), yet nothing *ought* to be the case for the thermostat. If phenomenal consciousness is what converts structural asymmetry into genuine normative direction, the functional reduction leaves out what matters most.

**The emotion problem**: Emotions complicate the framework. Fear of a bear involves mind-to-world fit (representing the bear as dangerous) and world-to-mind fit (motivating escape). Admiration involves representing something as excellent (mind-to-world) without clear desire to change anything. Undirected anxiety may lack propositional content entirely. These complex cases suggest that direction of fit is a spectrum or multidimensional phenomenon rather than a strict dichotomy.

## What Would Challenge This View?

The argument that direction of fit supports dualism and bidirectional interaction would weaken if:

1. **Normative naturalism succeeded.** If the normativity of representation—the "should" in "beliefs should track truth"—were fully explained in natural terms, one motivation for linking direction of fit to irreducible consciousness would dissolve.

2. **Functional direction of fit proved sufficient.** If a purely structural account of the belief-desire asymmetry captured everything relevant to explanation and prediction, the phenomenal dimension would be explanatorily idle.

3. **AI systems exhibited genuine world-to-mind fit.** If systems without phenomenal consciousness demonstrated genuine intention—not just goal-directed behaviour but the normative structure where the world *ought* to change—the link between direction of fit and phenomenal consciousness would break.

## Relation to Site Perspective

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction):** World-to-mind direction of fit is, at its core, a description of consciousness acting on the world. Desires, intentions, and plans all specify states of affairs that reality should conform to. If these states are genuinely efficacious—if the world actually changes in response to their content—then consciousness causally influences physical outcomes. Direction of fit makes the bidirectional picture concrete: perception flows world-to-mind, and intention flows mind-to-world.

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism):** The normative dimension of direction of fit resists physical reduction. Neural states do not bear "should" relations to the world; intentional states do. This normative gap parallels the [explanatory gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/): just as no physical description entails phenomenal experience, no physical description entails that a state *ought* to match reality.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits):** Reducing direction of fit to biological function or computational structure achieves parsimony by discarding the normative and phenomenal dimensions. The apparent simplicity may reflect a failure to account for features that the full phenomenon exhibits.
