[Interactionist dualism](/concepts/interactionist-dualism/) faces six major philosophical objections: the [pairing problem](/concepts/pairing-problem/), conservation laws, parsimony, the decoherence objection, the evolutionary argument, and Kim's exclusion argument. This page provides comprehensive treatment of each objection and the responses available to the interactionist—particularly within the [quantum framework](/concepts/quantum-consciousness/) The Unfinishable Map adopts. The key finding: five objections have principled responses, and the sixth (evolution) actually *supports* interactionism against its main rival, [epiphenomenalism](/concepts/epiphenomenalism/).

## The Pairing Problem

### The Objection

Jaegwon Kim's pairing problem (2005) presents a distinct challenge beyond [causal closure](/concepts/causal-closure/). Even granting that consciousness could causally affect physics, what pairs a particular mind with a particular body?

Consider two minds M1 and M2 interacting with two bodies B1 and B2. Both minds intend to raise their hand. M1's intention causes B1's hand to rise; M2's intention causes B2's hand to rise. But *in virtue of what* is M1 paired with B1 rather than B2?

For physical causation, spatial relations provide the answer. The billiard ball strikes *this* ball because they occupy adjacent positions. But if minds are non-spatial (as traditional substance dualism holds), no spatial relation can ground the pairing. Kim argues: "Causal relations between physical objects or events appear to depend crucially on their spatiotemporal relations to each other." If causation requires spatial relations, and minds lack spatial location, minds cannot enter into causal relations at all.

### The Spatial Location Response

Many contemporary dualists (Hasker, Zimmerman) accept that minds are spatially located—specifically, in the brain region where they causally interact. M1 is paired with B1 because M1 occupies B1's brain. This dissolves the pairing problem while maintaining that minds are ontologically distinct from bodies.

Kim objects: what prevents two intrinsically indiscernible souls from occupying the same region? Dualists would need an analogue to the impenetrability of matter for souls.

This objection has force only if we assume souls could be intrinsically indiscernible. But interactionists can hold that souls are individuated by their causal histories—the ongoing interaction with a particular body creates individuation. Just as two physical objects in the same region would interfere with each other, two minds interfacing with the same brain would produce incoherent experience. We don't observe this, suggesting it doesn't occur.

### The Haecceities Response

Andrew Bailey, Joshua Rasmussen, and Luke Van Horn (2011) argue there is "no pairing problem." Their dilemma: either [haecceities](/concepts/haecceity/) (primitive "thisness") exist or they don't.

If haecceities exist, they can ground the pairing relation without spatial location. M1 is paired with B1 because of M1's haecceity and B1's haecceity standing in the appropriate relation. The haecceity page explores how this concept applies more broadly to consciousness and personal identity.

If haecceities don't exist, the pairing problem generalizes to all causation. What pairs *any* cause with *any* effect? The problem isn't specific to mind-body interaction but applies universally. The dualist doesn't face a special difficulty—everyone faces the same challenge.

### The Quantum Fit

The Map's [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) framework provides a natural answer. If consciousness interfaces with the brain at quantum indeterminacies in specific neural structures, consciousness is located *where those structures are*. The distinctiveness of consciousness is metaphysical, not spatial—it can be a different kind of thing from matter while still occupying space.

[Interface locality](/concepts/brain-interface-boundary/) reinforces this: each consciousness can only interface with its own brain because the quantum Zeno mechanism requires the observer-system coupling that exists only within one's neural substrate. You cannot attend to distant quantum systems the way you attend to your own neural states. The pairing is built into the mechanism.

## Conservation Laws

### The Objection

Since Leibniz, critics argue that mind-body interaction violates conservation of energy and momentum:

1. Conservation laws state that energy (and momentum) in a closed system remains constant
2. If mind causally affects body, energy must enter the physical system from outside
3. This violates conservation laws
4. Therefore, minds cannot causally affect bodies

David Papineau (2001) develops this into an argument *for* causal closure: all known physical forces reduce to a small stock of conservative forces. Induction suggests mental forces (if they existed) would also be conservative—but if they're conservative, they're physical. Sean Carroll demands: "What particles is that soul made of? What forces are holding it together?" Two centuries of neuroscience reveal no trace of non-physical forces; if such forces existed, we would observe anomalous particle accelerations.

For comprehensive treatment of why this objection fails, see [conservation-laws-and-mind](/topics/conservation-laws-and-mind/). The key insights are summarized below.

### Response 1: Conservation Is Local and Conditional

J. Brian Pitts and Alin Cucu demonstrate that conservation laws are *local* and *conditional*, not cosmic truths. Energy conservation holds "not primarily for the whole universe, but in every place separately"—the mathematics uses local continuity equations, not global accounting. More fundamentally, Noether's theorem shows conservation arises from symmetries: when time-translation symmetry holds, energy is conserved.

The converse also holds: if an external influence breaks the symmetry, conservation fails at that location. As Cucu and Pitts argue: "Expecting conservation to hold in the brain (without looking) simply assumes the falsehood of Cartesianism. Hence Leibniz's objection begs the question."

The conservation objection assumes from the start that minds don't act on matter—precisely what it's supposed to prove.

### Response 2: Physics Without External Influences

Robins Collins (2011) notes conservation isn't ubiquitous even within physics:

- Energy isn't conserved in **general relativity** (no global time symmetry in curved spacetime)
- In **quantum field theory**, vacuum fluctuations create and destroy energy temporarily
- In the **expanding universe**, cosmological red-shift means photon energy is not globally conserved

Conservation is local and approximate, not a universal metaphysical truth. Physics itself provides precedents for conservation failure.

### Response 3: Selection Not Injection

The Map's primary response: at quantum indeterminacies, consciousness *selects* among possible outcomes without *injecting* energy. All possible outcomes are already present in the wavefunction with their associated energies. When consciousness biases which outcome actualizes, it determines which pre-existing possibility becomes real—no new energy enters the system.

Consider a superposition of two neural firing patterns, each with identical energy. Physics determines that *one* will become actual, with probabilities for each. But physics doesn't determine *which* one actualizes. Consciousness selects without energy injection—the conservation equations are satisfied for every possible outcome.

Critics would need to show that *outcome selection* requires energy injection. But given the indeterministic character of quantum mechanics, this isn't obvious. Selection among equi-energetic possibilities is precisely what the formalism leaves open.

Quantum entanglement provides precedent: correlations between distant particles cannot be explained by any energy transfer between them (Bell's theorem rules this out), yet the correlations are real and causally significant. If physics permits causal connections without energy exchange in entanglement, the conceptual space exists for mind-matter interaction without energy injection.

## Parsimony

### The Objection

Physicalism is simpler than dualism, therefore preferable by Occam's Razor:

1. Parsimony favors theories with fewer ontological commitments
2. Physicalism posits only physical substances; dualism posits physical and mental substances
3. Therefore, physicalism is more parsimonious
4. All else being equal, prefer physicalism

### Response 1: All Else Isn't Equal

Parsimony applies only when theories have equal explanatory power. Physicalism notoriously struggles with consciousness. The [hard problem](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/) shows that physical descriptions—however complete—don't entail phenomenal experience. The [explanatory-gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/) between physical structure and subjective quality has resisted closure despite decades of effort.

A simpler theory that *doesn't explain the data* isn't preferable. If materialism cannot account for consciousness, its apparent parsimony is irrelevant.

### Response 2: Type vs. Token Parsimony

Dualism adds one ontological *type* (mind), not millions of *tokens*. Adding one well-motivated category isn't extravagant parsimony violation. Physics itself posits multiple fundamental types—fermions, bosons, four fundamental forces—without parsimony complaint. Why should consciousness be different?

### Response 3: Consciousness as Datum

If consciousness is real and irreducible (which experience suggests), then ignoring it isn't parsimony—it's ignoring evidence. Parsimony means not multiplying entities *beyond necessity*. If consciousness cannot be reduced to physics, its acknowledgment is necessary.

The phenomenal world is the one thing we know most directly. Physical theories are inferred from observations; observations are conscious experiences. Eliminating consciousness to achieve parsimony is like eliminating the foundation to simplify the building.

### Response 4: Occam's Razor Has Limits

This is the Map's [fifth tenet](/tenets/#occams-limits). Parsimony is a methodological heuristic, not a metaphysical truth. It has repeatedly pointed away from truth in the history of science:

- Heliocentrism initially required more epicycles than geocentrism
- Atomic theory posited invisible entities when continuous matter seemed simpler
- Quantum mechanics replaced deterministic simplicity with probability amplitudes and superposition

The apparent simplicity of physicalism may reflect our ignorance rather than reality. When confronting consciousness—a domain where our conceptual tools may be fundamentally inadequate—simplicity is an unreliable guide.

## The Decoherence Objection

### The Objection

The [decoherence objection](/concepts/decoherence/) targets quantum-based interactionism specifically. If consciousness operates through quantum mechanisms, it requires quantum superpositions to persist long enough for selection. But warm biological systems destroy quantum coherence almost instantly:

1. Quantum coherence in molecular systems at body temperature decoheres in femtoseconds (10⁻¹⁵ seconds)
2. Neural processes operate on millisecond timescales (10⁻³ seconds)
3. The gap is twelve orders of magnitude—quantum effects cannot persist long enough to matter
4. Therefore, consciousness cannot operate through quantum mechanisms

Max Tegmark (2000) calculated that quantum coherence in brain microtubules would decay in about 10⁻¹³ seconds. If consciousness needs quantum indeterminacy to select outcomes, and quantum indeterminacy vanishes before any selection could occur, the quantum framework fails.

### Response 1: Revised Calculations

Tegmark's calculation assumed thermal equilibrium—appropriate for dead tissue, not living systems—and separation distances larger than proposed mechanisms require. Hameroff and colleagues recalculated using parameters appropriate to Orch OR theory. The revised coherence times increase by seven orders of magnitude, reaching 10⁻⁵ to 10⁻⁴ seconds—still short, but approaching timescales relevant to neural dynamics.

### Response 2: Quantum Biology Evidence

Recent experiments have complicated the simple "warm means no quantum" picture:

- **Photosynthesis**: Quantum coherence in light-harvesting complexes persists for hundreds of femtoseconds at room temperature—far longer than Tegmark-style calculations predicted
- **Microtubule anesthesia**: A 2025 study found microtubule-stabilizing drugs delay anesthesia onset, suggesting microtubule dynamics matter for consciousness
- **MRI entanglement signatures**: Kerskens and Pérez (2022-2023) detected what they interpret as entanglement signatures in human brain MRI, correlating with working memory tasks

These findings don't prove quantum consciousness but demonstrate that quantum effects in biological systems are more robust than assumed.

### Response 3: The Measurement Question

Critically, decoherence does not solve the [measurement problem](/concepts/measurement-problem/). Decoherence explains why interference effects wash out—why we don't see cats both alive and dead. But it doesn't explain why we see *definite* outcomes at all. After decoherence, quantum mechanics still describes the total system as a vast entangled superposition.

If definite outcomes require something beyond decoherence—whether consciousness, objective collapse, or hidden variables—then the question of what selects outcomes remains open. Decoherence establishes preferred bases; it doesn't collapse them. The Map's [No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds) tenet holds that genuine selection occurs. Whatever does the selecting might be consciousness.

### Response 4: Non-Computational Selection

Even if decoherence eliminates quantum *computing* in the brain, it may not eliminate quantum *selection*. Consciousness might not need coherent superpositions—it might select among classical-looking outcomes that decoherence produces. A weaker claim than Orch OR, but still providing room for mental causation where physics leaves outcomes undetermined.

## The Evolutionary Argument

### The Objection

Often presented as objecting to dualism, this argument actually targets [epiphenomenalism](/concepts/epiphenomenalism/) and *supports* interactionism:

1. Pleasures correlate with survival-beneficial stimuli; pains with harmful stimuli
2. This correlation requires evolutionary explanation
3. Natural selection can only favor traits with causal effects on behavior
4. Therefore, consciousness has causal effects (contra epiphenomenalism)
5. Therefore, interactionism (or physicalism) is true; epiphenomenalism is false

William James (1890) first articulated this reasoning. The precise correlation between phenomenal valence and biological utility demands explanation. Why does *this* experience (pleasure) reliably accompany *this* type of event (fitness-enhancing behavior)?

### Why This Supports Interactionism

The argument has no force against interactionist dualism. Interactionism holds that consciousness causes physical effects—exactly what the evolutionary argument requires. The argument targets only those forms of dualism (epiphenomenalism, parallelism) that deny mental causation.

The Map can use this argument *offensively* against epiphenomenalism: if consciousness causes nothing, evolution can't explain the observed correlations. The precise tracking of phenomenal states with fitness-relevant behaviors would be an inexplicable coincidence.

### The Epiphenomenalist Response

Frank Jackson suggests consciousness might be a "spandrel"—a by-product of neural processes that were themselves selected for. Consciousness would be correlated with beneficial behaviors without causing them.

**Counter-response**: This explains why consciousness *exists* (as spandrel) but not why the pain/pleasure correlations are so precise. Why should a causally inert spandrel track fitness so accurately? A by-product might exist without being finely tuned. The precision of valence-fitness correlation suggests causal involvement, not mere epiphenomenal tagging.

## The Exclusion Argument

### The Objection

Kim's exclusion argument goes beyond simple causal closure to argue that even if there's room for mental causation, mental properties would be "excluded" by physical properties:

1. **Supervenience**: Mental properties supervene on physical properties (no mental difference without physical difference)
2. **Causal relevance**: If mental property M supervenes on physical property P, and P is sufficient for effect E, then M seems causally redundant
3. **Exclusion**: P "screens off" M from E—P does all the causal work
4. **Conclusion**: M either is identical to P (reductionism) or causes nothing (epiphenomenalism)

### The Drainage Problem

Kim calls this "causal drainage"—efficacy drains to fundamental physics. This threatens all higher-level causation: does temperature cause anything, or just molecular motion? The generalization either undermines all special sciences (implausible) or suggests the exclusion reasoning is flawed.

### Response 1: Interventionism

James Woodward's interventionist theory defines causes as factors whose manipulation changes effects. Intervening on mental states (through reasoning, therapy, meditation) produces different physical outcomes. The exclusion argument assumes a "building block" model that interventionism replaces with counterfactuals.

### Response 2: Levels and Proportionality

Stephen Yablo argues mental properties may be more *proportional* causes. "Being in pain" may be the right level for explaining avoidance behavior; neural details may be over-specific. Mental and physical descriptions capture the same process at different levels—one cause under two descriptions, not two competing causes.

### Response 3: Quantum Insufficiency

The Map's primary response: the exclusion argument assumes that physical properties provide *sufficient* causes. But at quantum indeterminacies, P is *not* sufficient for E—physics determines probabilities but not outcomes.

Where physics is genuinely incomplete, mental properties can fill the gap without exclusion. There is no sufficient physical cause to do the excluding. Mental causation operates where physical causation runs out.

This transforms the exclusion argument from a dilemma into a false premise: closure fails at indeterminacies, so premise 2 (sufficiency of physical causes) fails.

### Response 4: Delegatory Preemption

[Delegatory dualism](/topics/delegatory-dualism/) (Bradford Saad, 2025) offers a distinct response that doesn't depend on quantum mechanics. When a physical brain state has the same causal profile as an experience—both would cause wincing, attention-shifting, verbal reports—the experience *[preempts](/concepts/preemption/)* the physical state's causal role. The physical state delegates its responsibilities to the experience.

This avoids overdetermination because only one cause operates: the experience does the causal work while the physical state is sidelined. Preemption differs from overdetermination the way an assassin's successful shot differs from a backup shooter's bullet arriving simultaneously—one cause acts, the other is rendered idle.

Saad's framework also distinguishes *[observational closure](/concepts/causal-closure/)* from *universal closure*: mental causation need not violate what physics experiments can detect, only what physics would accomplish if consciousness weren't present. This distinction strengthens the falsifiability conditions discussed below.

### Connection to the Luck Objection

The exclusion argument parallels the [luck objection](/concepts/luck-objection/) to libertarian free will. Both ask: what work does consciousness do? The Map's response: consciousness selects among undetermined possibilities—neither redundant (possibilities are open) nor arbitrary (consciousness provides direction). The quantum Zeno mechanism and delegatory preemption both model how this selection could operate without overdetermination or randomness.

## What Would Challenge This View?

Interactionism would face serious difficulty if:

1. **Deterministic neural dynamics**: If all neural activity could be predicted from prior physical states with no residual indeterminacy, consciousness would have nowhere to act. Current neuroscience cannot achieve such prediction, but this reflects practical limits rather than principled indeterminacy.

2. **MWI confirmation**: If the [Many-Worlds interpretation](/concepts/many-worlds/) were empirically confirmed—if branching could be detected and the probability interpretation derived—then all outcomes occur and "selection" is illusory. The Map's No Many Worlds tenet would fail.

3. **Conservation violations detected**: If mental causation required energy injection, and we observed systematic conservation violations in neural systems, the objection would stand. We observe no such violations—consistent with either epiphenomenalism or selection among equi-energetic outcomes.

4. **Decoherence proves absolute**: If experiments demonstrated that no quantum effects—computational or otherwise—survive in neural tissue, quantum-based interactionism would need abandonment or revision toward purely classical selection models (which face worse difficulties).

These are empirical and interpretive questions, not settled by philosophical argument alone. The debate continues.

## Relation to the Map's Perspective

The objections to interactionism motivate rather than undermine the Map's framework.

The [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) tenet directly addresses the conservation and exclusion objections: consciousness acts where physics is incomplete, selecting among equi-energetic possibilities that physics leaves undetermined. No energy injection, no competition with sufficient physical causes.

The [Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits) tenet addresses parsimony: simplicity is unreliable when knowledge is incomplete. Materialism's apparent simplicity reflects inability to explain, not success in explaining.

The [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet affirms what the evolutionary argument requires: consciousness causes physical effects. The precision of valence-fitness correlation is explicable because phenomenal states genuinely influence behavior.

The pairing problem is addressed by interface locality: consciousness is located where its quantum interface is, and each mind can only interface with its own brain. Spatial location is compatible with metaphysical distinctiveness.

The exclusion argument receives two complementary responses: quantum insufficiency (physics leaves outcomes undetermined) and [delegatory preemption](/topics/delegatory-dualism/) (consciousness takes over causal work rather than duplicating it). Together, these show that mental causation need not compete with or overdetermine physical causation.

These objections have been taken seriously throughout the history of philosophy. That principled responses exist—within both quantum and non-quantum frameworks—shows interactionism remains viable.
