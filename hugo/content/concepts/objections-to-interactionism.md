[Interactionist dualism](/archive/arguments/interactionist-dualism/) faces five major philosophical objections: the pairing problem, conservation laws, parsimony, the evolutionary argument, and the exclusion argument. This page provides comprehensive treatment of each objection and the responses available to the interactionist—particularly within the quantum framework this site adopts. The key finding: four objections have principled responses, and the fifth (evolution) actually *supports* interactionism against its main rival, [epiphenomenalism](/arguments/epiphenomenalism/).

## The Pairing Problem

### The Objection

Jaegwon Kim's pairing problem (2005) presents a distinct challenge beyond [causal closure](/concepts/causal-closure/). Even granting that consciousness could causally affect physics, what pairs a particular mind with a particular body?

Consider two minds M1 and M2 interacting with two bodies B1 and B2. Both minds intend to raise their hand. M1's intention causes B1's hand to rise; M2's intention causes B2's hand to rise. But *in virtue of what* is M1 paired with B1 rather than B2?

For physical causation, spatial relations provide the answer. The billiard ball strikes *this* ball because they occupy adjacent positions. But if minds are non-spatial (as traditional substance dualism holds), no spatial relation can ground the pairing. Kim argues: "Causal relations between physical objects or events appear to depend crucially on their spatiotemporal relations to each other." If causation requires spatial relations, and minds lack spatial location, minds cannot enter into causal relations at all.

### The Spatial Location Response

Many contemporary dualists (Hasker, Zimmerman) accept that minds are spatially located—specifically, in the brain region where they causally interact. M1 is paired with B1 because M1 occupies B1's brain. This dissolves the pairing problem while maintaining that minds are ontologically distinct from bodies.

Kim objects: what prevents two intrinsically indiscernible souls from occupying the same region? Dualists would need an analogue to the impenetrability of matter for souls.

This objection has force only if we assume souls could be intrinsically indiscernible. But interactionists can hold that souls are individuated by their causal histories—the ongoing interaction with a particular body creates individuation. Just as two physical objects in the same region would interfere with each other, two minds interfacing with the same brain would produce incoherent experience. We don't observe this, suggesting it doesn't occur.

### The Haecceities Response

Andrew Bailey, Joshua Rasmussen, and Luke Van Horn (2011) argue there is "no pairing problem." Their dilemma: either haecceities (primitive "thisness") exist or they don't.

If haecceities exist, they can ground the pairing relation without spatial location. M1 is paired with B1 because of M1's haecceity and B1's haecceity standing in the appropriate relation.

If haecceities don't exist, the pairing problem generalizes to all causation. What pairs *any* cause with *any* effect? The problem isn't specific to mind-body interaction but applies universally. The dualist doesn't face a special difficulty—everyone faces the same challenge.

### The Quantum Fit

The site's [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) framework provides a natural answer. If consciousness interfaces with the brain at quantum indeterminacies in specific neural structures, consciousness is located *where those structures are*. The distinctiveness of consciousness is metaphysical, not spatial—it can be a different kind of thing from matter while still occupying space.

[Interface locality](/concepts/interface-locality/) reinforces this: each consciousness can only interface with its own brain because the quantum Zeno mechanism requires the observer-system coupling that exists only within one's neural substrate. You cannot attend to distant quantum systems the way you attend to your own neural states. The pairing is built into the mechanism.

## Conservation Laws

### The Objection

Since Leibniz, critics argue that mind-body interaction violates conservation of energy and momentum:

1. Conservation laws state that energy (and momentum) in a closed system remains constant
2. If mind causally affects body, energy must enter the physical system from outside
3. This violates conservation laws
4. Therefore, minds cannot causally affect bodies

David Papineau (2001) develops this into an argument *for* causal closure: all known physical forces reduce to a small stock of conservative forces. Induction suggests mental forces (if they existed) would also be conservative—but if they're conservative, they're physical. Two centuries of neuroscience reveal no trace of non-physical forces; if such forces existed, we would observe anomalous particle accelerations.

### Response 1: Energy Types Aren't Specified

Conservation laws don't dictate *what kinds* of energy exist. If "psychic energy" exists and operates conservatively (transforms rather than appearing/disappearing), no violation occurs. Tim O'Connor suggests consciousness might *redirect* energy without adding it—changing the direction of physical processes rather than their magnitude.

### Response 2: Conservation is Local

Robins Collins (2011) argues conservation isn't ubiquitous in physics:

- Energy isn't conserved in **general relativity** (no global time symmetry in curved spacetime)
- In **quantum field theory**, vacuum fluctuations create and destroy energy temporarily
- In the **expanding universe**, cosmological red-shift means photon energy is not globally conserved

Conservation is local and approximate, not a universal metaphysical truth. Physics itself provides precedents for conservation failure.

### Response 3: The Quantum Exception

The site's primary response: at quantum indeterminacies, consciousness selects among possible outcomes without adding energy. The outcomes all have the same energy; consciousness just determines *which* one actualizes.

Consider a superposition of two neural firing patterns, each with identical energy. Physics determines that *one* will become actual, with probabilities for each. But physics doesn't determine *which* one actualizes. Consciousness selects without energy injection—the conservation equations are satisfied for every possible outcome.

Critics would need to show that *outcome selection* requires energy injection. But given the indeterministic character of quantum mechanics, this isn't obvious. Selection among equi-energetic possibilities is precisely what the formalism leaves open.

### Response 4: Noether's Theorem Consideration

Conservation follows from symmetry (Noether's theorem). If non-physical influence breaks time-translation symmetry locally in neural systems, conservation fails locally. This doesn't violate physics—physics correctly predicts conservation where symmetry holds. The question is whether symmetry holds everywhere.

## Parsimony

### The Objection

Physicalism is simpler than dualism, therefore preferable by Occam's Razor:

1. Parsimony favors theories with fewer ontological commitments
2. Physicalism posits only physical substances; dualism posits physical and mental substances
3. Therefore, physicalism is more parsimonious
4. All else being equal, prefer physicalism

### Response 1: All Else Isn't Equal

Parsimony applies only when theories have equal explanatory power. Physicalism notoriously struggles with consciousness. The [hard problem](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/) shows that physical descriptions—however complete—don't entail phenomenal experience. The [explanatory-gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/) between physical structure and subjective quality has resisted closure despite decades of effort.

A simpler theory that *doesn't explain the data* isn't preferable. If materialism cannot account for consciousness, its apparent parsimony is irrelevant.

### Response 2: Type vs. Token Parsimony

Dualism adds one ontological *type* (mind), not millions of *tokens*. Adding one well-motivated category isn't extravagant parsimony violation. Physics itself posits multiple fundamental types—fermions, bosons, four fundamental forces—without parsimony complaint. Why should consciousness be different?

### Response 3: Consciousness as Datum

If consciousness is real and irreducible (which experience suggests), then ignoring it isn't parsimony—it's ignoring evidence. Parsimony means not multiplying entities *beyond necessity*. If consciousness cannot be reduced to physics, its acknowledgment is necessary.

The phenomenal world is the one thing we know most directly. Physical theories are inferred from observations; observations are conscious experiences. Eliminating consciousness to achieve parsimony is like eliminating the foundation to simplify the building.

### Response 4: Occam's Razor Has Limits

This is the site's [fifth tenet](/tenets/#occams-limits). Parsimony is a methodological heuristic, not a metaphysical truth. It has repeatedly pointed away from truth in the history of science:

- Heliocentrism initially required more epicycles than geocentrism
- Atomic theory posited invisible entities when continuous matter seemed simpler
- Quantum mechanics replaced deterministic simplicity with probability amplitudes and superposition

The apparent simplicity of physicalism may reflect our ignorance rather than reality. When confronting consciousness—a domain where our conceptual tools may be fundamentally inadequate—simplicity is an unreliable guide.

## The Evolutionary Argument

### The Objection

Often presented as objecting to dualism, this argument actually targets [epiphenomenalism](/arguments/epiphenomenalism/) and *supports* interactionism:

1. Pleasures correlate with survival-beneficial stimuli; pains with harmful stimuli
2. This correlation requires evolutionary explanation
3. Natural selection can only favor traits with causal effects on behavior
4. Therefore, consciousness has causal effects (contra epiphenomenalism)
5. Therefore, interactionism (or physicalism) is true; epiphenomenalism is false

William James (1890) first articulated this reasoning. The precise correlation between phenomenal valence and biological utility demands explanation. Why does *this* experience (pleasure) reliably accompany *this* type of event (fitness-enhancing behavior)?

### Why This Supports Interactionism

The argument has no force against interactionist dualism. Interactionism holds that consciousness causes physical effects—exactly what the evolutionary argument requires. The argument targets only those forms of dualism (epiphenomenalism, parallelism) that deny mental causation.

The site can use this argument *offensively* against epiphenomenalism: if consciousness causes nothing, evolution can't explain the observed correlations. The precise tracking of phenomenal states with fitness-relevant behaviors would be an inexplicable coincidence.

### The Epiphenomenalist Response

Frank Jackson suggests consciousness might be a "spandrel"—a by-product of neural processes that were themselves selected for. Consciousness would be correlated with beneficial behaviors without causing them.

**Counter-response**: This explains why consciousness *exists* (as spandrel) but not why the pain/pleasure correlations are so precise. Why should a causally inert spandrel track fitness so accurately? A by-product might exist without being finely tuned. The precision of valence-fitness correlation suggests causal involvement, not mere epiphenomenal tagging.

## The Exclusion Argument

### The Objection

Kim's exclusion argument goes beyond simple causal closure to argue that even if there's room for mental causation, mental properties would be "excluded" by physical properties:

1. **Supervenience**: Mental properties supervene on physical properties (no mental difference without physical difference)
2. **Causal relevance**: If mental property M supervenes on physical property P, and P is sufficient for effect E, then M seems causally redundant
3. **Exclusion**: P "screens off" M from E—P does all the causal work
4. **Conclusion**: M either is identical to P (reductionism) or causes nothing (epiphenomenalism)

### The Drainage Problem

Kim calls this "causal drainage"—efficacy drains from higher levels to lower levels, pooling at fundamental physics. This threatens not just mental causation but all higher-level causation. Does temperature cause anything, or just molecular motion? Does natural selection cause anything, or just physics?

This generalization either undermines all special sciences (implausible) or suggests the exclusion reasoning itself is flawed.

### Response 1: Interventionism

James Woodward's interventionist theory defines causes as factors whose manipulation would change effects. Mental properties can satisfy this criterion: intervening on mental states (through reasoning, therapy, meditation) produces different physical outcomes. The exclusion argument assumes a "building block" model of causation that interventionism replaces with a counterfactual model.

### Response 2: Levels and Proportionality

Stephen Yablo argues mental properties may be more *proportional* causes—neither too specific nor too general. "Being in pain" may be the right level of description for explaining avoidance behavior; neural details may be over-specific. The mental cause captures what's explanatorily relevant without redundant specificity.

Mental and physical descriptions may capture the same causal process at different levels. There aren't two competing causes but one cause under two descriptions.

### Response 3: Quantum Insufficiency

The site's primary response: the exclusion argument assumes that physical properties provide *sufficient* causes. But at quantum indeterminacies, P is *not* sufficient for E—physics determines probabilities but not outcomes.

Where physics is genuinely incomplete, mental properties can fill the gap without exclusion. There is no sufficient physical cause to do the excluding. Mental causation operates where physical causation runs out.

This transforms the exclusion argument from a dilemma into a false premise: closure fails at indeterminacies, so premise 2 (sufficiency of physical causes) fails.

## Summary

| Objection | Target | Site's Response | Strength |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|----------|
| Pairing problem | Substance dualism | Minds are spatially located (in brains); interface locality provides natural pairing | Strong |
| Conservation laws | Interactionism | Quantum selection without energy injection; all outcomes are equi-energetic | Strong |
| Parsimony | Dualism | Consciousness is evidence; materialism doesn't explain it; simplicity isn't truth | Strong |
| Evolutionary argument | Epiphenomenalism | *Supports* interactionism—consciousness must cause to be selected | N/A (supports site) |
| Exclusion argument | Mental causation | Physics is insufficient at quantum indeterminacies; no sufficient cause to exclude | Strong |

## Relation to This Site's Perspective

The objections to interactionism motivate rather than undermine the site's framework.

The [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) tenet directly addresses the conservation and exclusion objections: consciousness acts where physics is incomplete, selecting among equi-energetic possibilities that physics leaves undetermined. No energy injection, no competition with sufficient physical causes.

The [Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits) tenet addresses parsimony: simplicity is unreliable when knowledge is incomplete. Materialism's apparent simplicity reflects inability to explain, not success in explaining.

The [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet affirms what the evolutionary argument requires: consciousness causes physical effects. The precision of valence-fitness correlation is explicable because phenomenal states genuinely influence behavior.

The pairing problem is addressed by interface locality: consciousness is located where its quantum interface is, and each mind can only interface with its own brain. Spatial location is compatible with metaphysical distinctiveness.

These objections have been taken seriously throughout the history of philosophy. That principled responses exist—particularly within a quantum framework—shows interactionism remains viable. The question of consciousness's relationship to physics is empirical and metaphysical, not settled by the objections here surveyed.
