Russellian monism holds that physics describes only the relational structure of matter—what things do to each other—leaving their intrinsic nature unexplained. These intrinsic properties, called *quiddities*, allegedly account for consciousness. The view attempts a middle path: avoiding [physicalism's](/arguments/materialism/) hard problem (by denying that structure alone determines experience) while avoiding [dualism's](/arguments/interactionist-dualism/) interaction problem (by integrating consciousness into physical causation). Yet the combination problem—how micro-level quiddities constitute unified conscious experience—remains unsolved, and critics argue Russellian monism inherits dualism's costs under a different name.

This site shares Russellian monism's insight that physics is silent on intrinsic nature. But the site's explicit [dualist](/tenets/#dualism) framework, particularly the [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) mechanism, provides cleaner solutions than monism's attempt to dissolve the mind-body distinction.

## The Core Insight: Physics Is Structural

Bertrand Russell (1927) and Arthur Eddington (1928) observed that physics describes only what things *do*—their causal and relational properties—not what they *are* intrinsically. Mass is defined by gravitational and inertial behavior. Charge is defined by electromagnetic interactions. No physical description tells us what mass or charge *is* in itself, only how it relates to other properties.

Eddington put it memorably: "The physical world is entirely abstract... It is a world of shadows." Physics gives us equations relating symbols; it doesn't reveal the concrete reality those symbols represent.

This creates space for consciousness. If physics captures only structure, something must *realize* that structure. Russellian monists propose that quiddities—the intrinsic natures of fundamental entities—are what realize it. And since consciousness is the one intrinsic nature we know directly (through introspection), perhaps consciousness *is* quiddity, or is grounded in it.

## Two Main Variants

### Panpsychist Russellian Monism

Galen Strawson, Philip Goff (in earlier work), and others argue that quiddities are phenomenal properties—experience is fundamental and ubiquitous. Every electron has some micro-experience; human consciousness is what micro-experiences look like "from inside" when organized into complex systems.

The attraction: this avoids emergence. We don't need to explain how consciousness arises from non-conscious matter because consciousness was there all along. Experience doesn't emerge; it combines.

Strawson's challenge: "Why posit non-experiential concrete reality with zero evidence? We have experience. We know it exists. We have no comparable certainty about wholly non-experiential matter."

### Panprotopsychist Russellian Monism

David Chalmers distinguishes panpsychism from *panprotopsychism*: quiddities might be non-phenomenal "protophenomenal" properties that jointly constitute phenomenal properties when appropriately organized. Electrons don't have experience; they have something that, in combination, yields experience.

The attraction: this avoids attributing experience to thermostats and rocks while keeping consciousness grounded in fundamental reality.

The problem: Chalmers notes a "revenge" argument. If protophenomenal quiddities aren't phenomenal, "protophenomenal zombies" seem conceivable—systems with all the protophenomenal properties but no experience. The conceivability argument that threatens standard physicalism threatens panprotopsychism too.

## The Combination Problem

Both variants face what Chalmers calls "the hard problem of panpsychism": how do micro-experiences or proto-experiences combine into unified macro-consciousness? This is the [combination problem](/concepts/combination-problem/).

The problem has several dimensions:

**Subject combination**: How do many micro-subjects become one macro-subject? Your experience is unified—you have *one* visual field, *one* stream of thought. If electrons have micro-experiences, how do billions of them yield one experiencer rather than billions?

**Quality combination**: Micro-phenomenal properties would be simple. How do they combine into the rich qualitative space of human experience? How does combining simple micro-colors yield the specific blue of the sky?

**Structure combination**: Neural structure is complex—billions of neurons in specific configurations. How does phenomenal structure track physical structure? What explains why *this* brain organization yields *this* experience?

Philip Goff proposed "phenomenal bonding"—a primitive relation that combines experiences. Critics object that this is explanatorily opaque; it names the problem rather than solving it. Goff himself later moved to *cosmopsychism*—the view that the universe as a whole is conscious, and individual consciousnesses are aspects of cosmic consciousness. This reverses the combination problem (explaining differentiation rather than combination) but faces problems of its own.

## Why the Site Prefers Explicit Dualism

Russellian monism claims to avoid dualism's costs—particularly the interaction problem (how do non-physical minds causally affect physical brains?). By making quiddities part of physical reality's fundamental structure, consciousness is automatically integrated into physical causation.

But Adam Pautz and other critics argue this is illusory. Russellian monism requires "grounding laws" connecting quiddities to consciousness—brute, fundamental laws specifying which quiddity configurations yield which experiences. These laws are no better than the brute psychophysical laws dualism posits. Pautz: "Though called a physicalist view, it seems to have many of the vices of dualism."

If Russellian monism is dualism under another name, the site's explicit [interactionist-dualism](/arguments/interactionist-dualism/) is preferable:

**Clearer ontology**: Dualism forthrightly posits mental substances or properties distinct from physical ones. Russellian monism obscures this behind the notion of "quiddities" that are somehow both physical and phenomenal.

**Avoids combination**: By positing unified mental subjects rather than combinations of micro-subjects, [substance dualism](/concepts/substance-property-dualism/) sidesteps the combination problem entirely. There's no question of how many experiences become one—the unified subject is fundamental.

**Interaction mechanism**: The site's [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) proposal addresses how consciousness interfaces with physics at the quantum level—selection among quantum outcomes. Russellian monism claims consciousness is already integrated but doesn't specify *how* the integration works in physical terms.

## What Russellian Monism Gets Right

Despite these criticisms, Russellian monism captures important insights the site endorses:

**Physics is incomplete**: The core observation—that physics describes structure without intrinsic nature—is correct and important. The site's framework agrees: physics doesn't explain why there is something it is like to be conscious.

**Consciousness is irreducible**: Russellian monism takes the [hard problem](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/) seriously rather than explaining it away. Whatever quiddities are, they're not reducible to structural-relational properties. This aligns with the site's [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism) tenet.

**Occam's limits**: The view exemplifies the site's [Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits) tenet. Physicalism seems simpler, but Russellian monists argue this simplicity is illusory—it ignores the intrinsic nature question. Apparent parsimony shouldn't foreclose inquiry into what physics leaves out.

**The conceivability argument works**: Russellian monists accept that [zombies](/concepts/philosophical-zombies/) are conceivable with respect to *structural* physics. They deny zombies are conceivable with respect to *complete* physics (including quiddities). This grants the site's core argument against materialism: structure doesn't entail experience.

## Relation to This Site's Perspective

**Dualism**: Russellian monism is officially a form of monism—one kind of stuff with different aspects. But its commitment to phenomenal properties irreducible to structure makes it closer to property dualism in practice. The site's explicit dualism is cleaner.

**Minimal Quantum Interaction**: The site proposes consciousness influences quantum outcomes. Russellian monism doesn't specify a mechanism—quiddities are simply "part of" physical reality. The quantum proposal gives concrete content to the mind-matter interface.

**Bidirectional Interaction**: The site holds that consciousness causally influences the physical world. Russellian monism claims quiddities "play indispensable roles in physical causation," but this remains schematic. The site's framework specifies *how*: selection among quantum superpositions.

**No Many Worlds**: Russellian monism is officially neutral on quantum interpretations, but its combination problem echoes branching-worlds issues. If consciousness is everywhere and combines, individuation becomes puzzling. The site's rejection of [Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds) and commitment to indexical identity provides clearer resources for understanding individual consciousness.

**Occam's Razor Has Limits**: Both the site and Russellian monism agree that apparent simplicity is an unreliable guide. The site applies this more consistently: if physicalism's simplicity is illusory, so may be monism's.
