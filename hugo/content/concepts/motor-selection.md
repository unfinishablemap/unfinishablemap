---

The premotor theory of attention proposes that attention and motor planning share the same neural substrates—attention shifts *are* motor plans. If Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism operates through attention, and attention is fundamentally motor planning, then a single quantum selection mechanism underlies both domains. The Unfinishable Map's framework unifies under one interface: consciousness selects among competing neural options through rapid observation, whether the selection concerns what to perceive or what to do.

This unification has substantial empirical support. Willed movements engage frontal theta oscillations just as willed attention does. Voluntary action takes approximately 280ms to commit (matching willed attention's ~300ms deployment). Neural populations simultaneously encode multiple potential actions, competing until one reaches threshold. The challenge from Libet's experiments—that the brain "decides" before we're aware—has been substantially weakened by evidence that the readiness potential is noise rather than decision.

## The Premotor Theory of Attention

### Attention as Motor Planning

Giacomo Rizzolatti's premotor theory of attention (PMTA) challenges the assumption that attention and motor control are separate systems. The core claim: "Selective attention and movement planning use the same neural substrates and there is no independent attention system."

Evidence: the same fronto-parietal networks activate during spatial attention shifts and motor preparation. Preparing an eye movement to location X improves visual processing at X—attention *is* the motor preparation. Microstimulation of motor regions enhances visual processing at the target location. Attempts to identify attention regions independent of motor planning consistently fail.

If PMTA is correct, the distinction between "attending to X" and "preparing to orient toward X" is artificial. What feels like directing attention is actually preparing action.

PMTA's proponents (Rizzolatti and colleagues) do not endorse dualist interpretations—the Map's extension is an application of their empirical findings, not a consequence they would accept.

### The Attention-Motor Parallel

The [attention as interface hypothesis](/concepts/attention-as-interface/) proposes that consciousness operates through attention, using the quantum Zeno effect to hold desired neural patterns stable. Motor control shows the same structure: frontal theta oscillations, ~280-300ms deployment time, distinct willed vs instructed signatures, bidirectional frontoparietal coherence, and effortful phenomenology. Both domains require selection among competing options—if consciousness contributes by selecting, the mechanism should be similar across domains.

### From Attention-as-Interface to Action-as-Interface

If attention is motor planning, the interface hypothesis becomes: consciousness influences the brain through action preparation. The interface isn't attention *as opposed to* action—the interface is the unified attention-action system. The prefrontal cortex, traditionally seen as housing "executive" functions, turns out to be fundamentally premotor—an action abstraction hierarchy from concrete motor commands to abstract goals (Wise & Murray 2022).

## Neural Competition and Selection

### Affordance Competition Hypothesis

Paul Cisek's affordance competition hypothesis describes how motor selection actually works in the brain:

1. **Parallel specification.** Sensory input automatically specifies multiple potential actions—affordances.

2. **Competition.** These options compete within neural populations. Cisek and Kalaska (2005) found that 43% of task-related cells in dorsal premotor cortex discharged for either of two potential reach targets—the neural population represented both options simultaneously.

3. **Threshold crossing.** Decision occurs when one population reaches threshold, biased by contextual factors including prefrontal input.

4. **Winner-take-all.** The winning action executes while competitors are suppressed.

This architecture provides a precise locus for quantum selection. During competition, multiple action representations exist simultaneously—a classical analog of quantum superposition. At threshold crossing, one becomes actual.

### Why Neural Competition Doesn't Suffice

Either competition is deterministic (one option was always going to win) or it involves genuine indeterminacy. If deterministic, deliberation is theatre—the 43% of neurons encoding both options weren't weighing alternatives but mechanically computing a predetermined outcome. If genuinely indeterminate, the physicalist response is that stochastic resolution biased by reward history and context suffices—no conscious selector needed. But this reduces choice to weighted randomness: the system rolls loaded dice, and whichever option happens to win is retrospectively called a "decision." For the outcome to be both undetermined and meaningful—not just statistically biased—something beyond neural dynamics must resolve the indeterminacy. Consciousness enters not as noise, but as the resolution of indeterminacy in a direction that reflects what the agent is trying to do.

### The 280ms Commitment Point

Thura and Cisek (2014) identified that approximately 280ms before movement onset, activity for the selected target reaches a consistent peak while the unselected target is suppressed—"volitional commitment to an action choice." This timing remarkably matches willed attention's ~300ms deployment (Bengson 2019), supporting unified mechanism.

### Basal Ganglia Brake-Release

The basal ganglia implement a brake-release model: tonic inhibition of motor programs (brake on), with D1-receptor striatal neurons releasing the brake on selected actions and D2-receptor neurons maintaining inhibition on competitors. The cortex generates ensembles of possible actions; the striatum selects—precisely the architecture the Map's framework requires: generation of options followed by selection among them.

## Dopamine and the Selection Interface

### The "Can Move / Won't Move" Distinction

Dopamine doesn't cause movement—it marks what's worth moving toward. Palmiter's dopamine-deficient mice demonstrate a clean dissociation: without dopamine, motor neurons fire normally, reflexes work, and mice can be made to run on a treadmill with external stimulation. Motor *capacity* is preserved. What's missing is spontaneous movement, goal-directed behaviour, the initiative to engage the intact motor system.

This pattern recurs in Parkinson's disease. Akinesia and bradykinesia are cardinal symptoms, yet patients perform rapid movements when externally triggered—the motor system works; something upstream in selection is compromised. External cues bypass the impaired selection mechanism.

The capacity/initiation dissociation maps onto a three-layer model:
1. **Neural computation** generates competing motor options (intact without dopamine)
2. **Dopamine** marks options as worth pursuing and modulates the selection threshold
3. **Consciousness** (via quantum selection) determines which marked option actualizes

If dopamine caused movement directly, dopamine-deficient animals couldn't move at all. If consciousness alone initiated movement, dopamine loss wouldn't affect initiative. The actual pattern—preserved capacity, lost initiative—places dopamine between option-generation and conscious selection.

### Wanting vs. Liking

Kent Berridge and Terry Robinson's research distinguishes *wanting* (incentive salience, mediated by mesolimbic dopamine) from *liking* (consummatory pleasure, mediated by opioid hedonic hotspots). Dopamine mediates the "pull" toward valued options, not the pleasure of attaining them.

Parkinson's patients show the dissociation clearly: normal hedonic ratings for sweet tastes (liking intact) but reduced motivation to pursue rewards (wanting impaired). Dopamine-replacement therapy occasionally produces the opposite—compulsive gambling or shopping—excessive pursuit without proportionate enjoyment.

Dopamine tags options as **worth considering** and gives them motivational pull, but doesn't determine which option wins. Consciousness selects among options that dopamine has marked as mattering—satisfying [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction), since consciousness doesn't generate wanting but selects among options that already have pull.

### Tonic and Phasic Signalling

Dopamine neurons operate in two modes. *Tonic* dopamine—slow, irregular baseline activity—establishes background levels determining overall system readiness. *Phasic* dopamine—rapid bursts encoding reward prediction errors—operates with sub-second precision.

A 2024 *Nature* study used optogenetics to selectively disrupt phasic dopamine while preserving tonic levels. Movement remained normal (tonic suffices), but reward-guided motivation was impaired (phasic required). Tonic dopamine ensures the selection system is "online"; phasic dopamine marks specific options at specific moments, creating the salience that quantum selection operates upon.

### Decision Threshold Modulation

A 2023 *Nature Communications* study found that striatal dopamine regulates decision thresholds in action selection. In drift-diffusion models, evidence for competing options accumulates until one crosses threshold. Dopamine modulates how much evidence is needed—not which option is correct.

If dopamine simply lowered threshold uniformly, faster responses would be random. But amphetamine improves performance on rewarding trials—the threshold reduction is selective. This leaves room for conscious contribution: dopamine sets the "stakes" (how much evidence is needed), while consciousness biases which accumulating option wins the race.

### Dopamine and Theta Oscillations

A 2024 *Brain* study found that both dopamine and deep brain stimulation shorten the latency between motor intention and execution by shifting oscillatory dynamics from antikinetic beta rhythms (13-35 Hz) to prokinetic theta rhythms (4-10 Hz). Frontal theta oscillations mark both willed attention (Bengson 2019) and motor preparation. Dopamine facilitates the theta state—the same timing substrate where both attentional and motor selection events occur.

This architecture satisfies Minimal Quantum Interaction: consciousness doesn't inject energy—it biases which accumulating option wins the threshold race.

## The Libet Challenge—and Its Dissolution

The [Libet experiments](/concepts/libet-experiments/) found that the readiness potential (RP) begins ~550ms before movement while conscious awareness occurs only ~200ms before—apparently showing the brain "decides" before we're aware.

Schurger's 2012 model reframes this finding. The RP may be an artifact of averaging stochastic neural noise, not a signature of unconscious decision. Movement occurs when random fluctuations happen to reach threshold; averaging across trials produces the RP shape. What consciousness contributes is determining *when to let* threshold-crossing happen.

Sjöberg (2024) provides surgical evidence: patients with resection of the supplementary motor area (SMA)—the region generating the RP—retain their sense of voluntary action. If the RP reflected genuine volition, removing it should impair voluntary action. It doesn't. The RP tracks motor preparation, not decision-making.

## Where Intention Originates

Desmurget's 2009 neurosurgical studies reveal a double dissociation: parietal stimulation produces conscious intention *without* movement (or false belief of having moved); premotor stimulation produces movement *without* awareness. The phenomenology of "deciding to move" is separable from the motor machinery that executes movement.

This maps directly onto the Map's framework. Consciousness contributes at the *selection* level—choosing what to do—not at the *execution* level. The parietal cortex, where intention emerges, is part of the posterior "hot zone" associated with conscious content. This explains why we experience choosing to reach for a cup but don't experience choosing the firing patterns of individual motor neurons. The quantum Zeno mechanism operates at the selection interface, not the execution machinery.

## Neural Signatures of Motor Selection

Research on [voluntary attention](/concepts/voluntary-attention-control-mechanisms/) (Bengson 2019) found that willed attention engages distinct neural mechanisms: frontal theta oscillations and bidirectional frontoparietal coherence. Motor control shows the same pattern—willed action involves bidirectional information flow (genuine "deliberation") while instructed action is primarily feedforward.

Both willed attention and willed motor action take approximately 300ms to deploy—versus ~100ms for automatic responses. If attention and motor selection were independent systems, this timing match would be coincidental. In the quantum Zeno framework, 300ms reflects the time required for consciousness to engage through repeated observation and stabilize the selected pattern to threshold.

## Quantum Zeno Applied

### Unified Selection Mechanism

[Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism](/concepts/stapp-quantum-mind/) proposes that mental attention operates like quantum observation—rapid, repeated "looks" at neural states hold desired patterns stable against their tendency to evolve into alternatives.

If attention is motor planning (PMTA), then the Zeno mechanism applies directly to motor selection. Attending to an action plan holds it stable. The same rapid observation that sustains attention to a visual target sustains preparation for a reaching movement.

The unified mechanism:

1. **Neural superposition.** Multiple motor programs exist in superposition (classical analog: competing representations in premotor populations).
2. **Attentional observation.** Directing attention to a motor plan constitutes observation of that neural state.
3. **Zeno stabilization.** Repeated observation prevents the plan from dissipating into alternatives.
4. **Threshold facilitation.** Sustained attention biases which population reaches threshold first.

This explains the common phenomenology. Sustaining motor intention feels effortful for the same reason sustaining attention feels effortful: both require continuous engagement to maintain Zeno freezing.

### Decoherence Considerations

The [decoherence](/concepts/decoherence/) addresses the standard challenge—rapid decoherence in warm brains. Hameroff (2014) calculates coherence times of 10⁻⁵ to 10⁻⁴ seconds for biological conditions—seven orders of magnitude longer than Tegmark's estimates, though these figures remain disputed. Additionally, the [post-decoherence selection response](/concepts/psychophysical-laws/) proposes consciousness might bias outcome selection *after* decoherence, at measurement collapse.

## The Phenomenology of Motor Choice

The [phenomenology of choice](/concepts/phenomenology-of-choice/) applies directly to motor selection. Willed movement has distinctive experiential character: felt effort that varies with difficulty, a strong sense of authorship, and the counterfactual sense that "I could have done otherwise." This phenomenological distinction tracks the neural distinction between willed and instructed action—real differences in brain function, not post-hoc narrative.

The sense of agency depends on efference copy—the brain's prediction of sensory consequences of motor commands. Match between prediction and feedback produces sense of agency; mismatch produces passivity experiences (as in alien hand syndrome). From the Map's perspective, efference copy may be how consciousness "reads" whether selection succeeded.

Stapp describes consciousness holding a "template for action" stable through the quantum Zeno effect. When preparing to move, you maintain an intention until the appropriate moment for execution. This holding requires effort—maintaining motor preparation against competing alternatives has phenomenal cost that correlates with difficulty, suggesting the phenomenology tracks something real about conscious contribution.

## The Illusionist Challenge

[Illusionists](/concepts/illusionism/) argue that motor selection phenomenology—effort, authorship, veto—is representational fiction. But as Tallis notes, "Misrepresentation presupposes presentation." To seem one way rather than another, there must be something it's like to seem.

The correlation between felt effort and motor difficulty poses a problem for illusionism. Novel movements feel harder than practiced ones; complex sequences feel harder than simple actions. The Zeno framework explains this: difficult actions require more frequent observation events, producing greater felt effort. If phenomenology were disconnected from motor processing, this correlation would be coincidental.

The zombie reformulation sharpens the challenge: a philosophical zombie would show the same neural signatures (frontal theta, bidirectional coherence) for "willed" versus "instructed" action without any phenomenal experience. Either these signatures cause phenomenology (contradicting illusionism) or they're unrelated to it (unexplained correlation).

## Relation to Site Perspective

### Dualism

The attention-motor unification supports the [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism) tenet. The dissociation between intention (parietal) and execution (premotor) suggests something contributes to intention that is not identical to motor execution machinery. Both willed attention and willed action feel like *you* doing something—not like watching computation unfold—suggesting a common agent behind both.

### Minimal Quantum Interaction

Motor selection satisfies the [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) constraint. Consciousness doesn't generate motor force—it biases selection among patterns the brain already generates. The bandwidth constraint (~10 bits/second for conscious processing) matches policy-level operation: you consciously select "reach for Y"—you don't consciously direct individual motor neurons.

### Bidirectional Interaction

The [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet finds direct support. Motor control is where consciousness visibly affects the physical world—words appear on screens, bodies move through space. If motor selection and attentional selection share a mechanism, the same interface connects consciousness to both perception and action.

### No Many Worlds

The quantum Zeno mechanism requires genuine collapse. If all branches actualize (many-worlds interpretation), there's nothing for consciousness to select—motor programs would execute in all branches, and consciousness would merely find itself in one. The [No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds) tenet preserves motor selection as genuine choice, not branch-discovery.

### Occam's Razor Has Limits

The "simpler" neural-determinism view cannot explain why the willed/instructed distinction exists neurally (why have it if epiphenomenal?) or why accurate effort phenomenology would evolve if causally inert. The [Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits) tenet explains: parsimony is unreliable when our knowledge is incomplete.

### An Honest Gap

This framework identifies *where* consciousness might influence motor selection—at threshold-crossing moments when competing options resolve. It does not explain *how* a non-physical consciousness biases physical outcomes. The psychophysical interface is located, not illuminated. This honest limitation distinguishes the Map's position from eliminativism (which denies the problem) and facile solutions (which claim to solve what they merely relocate).
