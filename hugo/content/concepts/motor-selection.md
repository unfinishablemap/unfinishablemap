---

The premotor theory of attention proposes that attention and motor planning share the same neural substrates—attention shifts *are* motor plans. If Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism operates through attention, and attention is fundamentally motor planning, then a single quantum selection mechanism underlies both domains. The Unfinishable Map's framework unifies under one interface: consciousness selects among competing neural options through rapid observation, whether the selection concerns what to perceive or what to do.

This unification has substantial empirical support. Willed movements engage frontal theta oscillations just as willed attention does. Voluntary action takes approximately 280ms to commit (matching willed attention's ~300ms deployment). Neural populations simultaneously encode multiple potential actions, competing until one reaches threshold. The challenge from Libet's experiments—that the brain "decides" before we're aware—has been substantially weakened by evidence that the readiness potential is noise rather than decision.

## The Premotor Theory of Attention

### Attention as Motor Planning

Giacomo Rizzolatti's premotor theory of attention (PMTA) challenges the assumption that attention and motor control are separate systems. The core claim: "Selective attention and movement planning use the same neural substrates and there is no independent attention system."

Evidence for this claim:

**Shared circuits.** The same fronto-parietal networks activate during spatial attention shifts and motor preparation. Preparing an eye movement to location X improves visual processing at X—not because attention follows intention, but because attention *is* the motor preparation.

**Activation dependencies.** Microstimulation of motor regions (frontal eye fields, premotor cortex) enhances visual processing at the target location. Motor preparation directly modulates perceptual processing through shared mechanisms.

**No pure attention system.** Attempts to identify attention regions independent of motor planning consistently fail. What looks like "pure" attention involves motor preparation for potential orienting movements, even when no movement occurs.

If PMTA is correct, the distinction between "attending to X" and "preparing to orient toward X" is artificial. The preparation *is* the attention. What feels like directing attention is actually preparing action.

PMTA's proponents (Rizzolatti and colleagues) do not endorse dualist interpretations—their framework is thoroughly neuroscientific. The Map's extension of PMTA to support interactionist dualism is an application of their empirical findings, not a consequence they would accept.

### The Attention-Motor Parallel

The [attention as interface hypothesis](/concepts/attention-as-interface/) proposes that consciousness operates through attention, using the quantum Zeno effect to hold desired neural patterns stable. Motor control shows the same structure:

| Feature | Willed Attention | Willed Movement |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Neural signature | Frontal theta oscillations | Frontal theta oscillations |
| Deployment time | ~300ms | ~280ms commitment |
| Willed vs instructed | Distinct signatures | Distinct signatures |
| Direction of coherence | Bidirectional frontoparietal | Bidirectional frontoparietal |
| Phenomenology | Feels effortful | Feels effortful |

This parallel is not coincidental. Both attention and motor control require selection among competing options—what to attend to, what to do. If consciousness contributes by selecting, the mechanism should be similar across domains.

### From Attention-as-Interface to Action-as-Interface

If attention is motor planning, the interface hypothesis becomes: consciousness influences the brain through action preparation. This extends rather than undermines the framework. The interface isn't attention *as opposed to* action—the interface is the unified attention-action system.

The prefrontal cortex, traditionally seen as housing "executive" functions distinct from motor functions, turns out to be fundamentally premotor. A 2022 Royal Society paper argues that "the entirety of the prefrontal cortex can be seen as fundamentally premotor in nature"—an action abstraction hierarchy from concrete motor commands to abstract goals.

## Neural Competition and Selection

### Affordance Competition Hypothesis

Paul Cisek's affordance competition hypothesis describes how motor selection actually works in the brain:

1. **Parallel specification.** Sensory input automatically specifies multiple potential actions—affordances. Seeing a cup on a table simultaneously activates reaching, grasping, and ignoring options.

2. **Competition.** These potential actions compete within neural populations. Cisek and Kalaska (2005) found that 43% of task-related cells in dorsal premotor cortex discharged for either of two potential reach targets—the neural population represented both options simultaneously.

3. **Threshold crossing.** Decision occurs when one competing population reaches threshold. The threshold emerges from nonlinear dynamics between populations, biased by contextual factors (including prefrontal input).

4. **Winner-take-all.** Once threshold is crossed, the winning action is executed while competitors are suppressed.

This architecture provides a precise locus for quantum selection. During competition, multiple action representations exist simultaneously—a classical analog of quantum superposition. At threshold crossing, one becomes actual.

### Why Neural Competition Doesn't Suffice

A natural response: "Neural dynamics alone determine the winner—no consciousness needed." But this faces a dilemma. Either the competition is deterministic (one option was always going to win given physical conditions) or it involves genuine indeterminacy.

If deterministic, then deliberation is theatre. The 43% of neurons encoding both options weren't weighing alternatives; they were mechanically computing a predetermined outcome. The phenomenology of effort and choice becomes illusion.

If genuinely indeterminate, something must resolve the indeterminacy. Pure randomness (quantum or classical noise) produces arbitrary selection, not *choice*. For the outcome to be both undetermined and meaningful, something beyond neural dynamics must bias which option actualizes. This is where consciousness enters—not as random noise, but as the resolution of indeterminacy in a direction that reflects what the agent is trying to do.

### The 280ms Commitment Point

Thura and Cisek (2014) identified a specific timing for motor commitment. Approximately 280ms before movement onset:

- Activity in dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) for the selected target reaches a consistent peak
- Activity in primary motor cortex (M1) for the unselected target is suppressed
- This constitutes "volitional commitment to an action choice"

The 280ms commitment point is remarkably close to the ~300ms deployment time for willed attention (Bengson 2019). Both domains involve the same temporal signature: roughly 300ms from decision to observable outcome. This matching supports unified mechanism—if attention and motor selection were independent systems, why would they share the same timeline?

### Basal Ganglia Brake-Release

The basal ganglia provide another candidate site for selection. Their architecture implements a brake-release model:

- **Tonic inhibition.** The basal ganglia output tonically inhibits motor programs—the brake is normally on.
- **Direct pathway.** D1-receptor striatal neurons, when activated, release the brake on selected actions.
- **Indirect pathway.** D2-receptor neurons maintain inhibition on competing actions.
- **Subthalamic nucleus.** The STN provides global "NoGo" that raises threshold when action conflict is detected.

The cortex generates ensembles of possible actions; the striatum selects. This is precisely the architecture the Map's framework requires: generation of options (by neural computation) followed by selection among them (where consciousness might contribute).

### Dopamine and the Selection Threshold

Recent research (2024-2025) illuminates dopamine's role in this selection architecture. A landmark October 2024 *Nature* study demonstrates a striking dissociation: **tonic (slow) dopamine supports spontaneous movement** while **phasic (rapid) dopamine drives motivation and reward-seeking behavior**. Dopamine-deficient mice "can move" but "won't move"—they retain motor capacity but lose goal-directed initiative.

This "can move / won't move" distinction is critical for the quantum selection framework. Dopamine doesn't generate movement or make movement possible—the motor circuitry remains intact without it. Instead, dopamine appears to modulate the **decision threshold** at which competing motor programs resolve.

The three-layer model:
1. **Neural computation** generates competing motor options (unaffected by dopamine loss)
2. **Dopamine** sets the threshold for selection and marks options as salient
3. **Consciousness** (via quantum selection) determines which salient option crosses threshold first

This architecture satisfies Minimal Quantum Interaction: consciousness doesn't inject energy or generate force—it biases which accumulating option wins the threshold race.

Dopamine mediates **salience**—the neural process by which certain stimuli or internal states gain prominence. Berridge and Robinson's dissociation between "wanting" (dopamine-dependent incentive salience) and "liking" (opioid-dependent hedonic pleasure) clarifies this: dopamine marks options as worth pursuing without determining whether pursuit succeeds.

## The Libet Challenge—and Its Dissolution

Benjamin Libet's 1983 experiments posed an apparent challenge to conscious motor control. He found:

1. **Readiness potential** (RP) begins ~550ms before movement
2. **Conscious awareness** of intention ("W" time) occurs only ~200ms before
3. Therefore, the brain "decides" ~350ms before we become aware

If the brain decides unconsciously and consciousness merely observes, motor control seems to exclude conscious selection.

### Schurger's Stochastic Reinterpretation

Aaron Schurger's 2012 model fundamentally reframes Libet. He showed the readiness potential may be an artifact of averaging stochastic neural noise—not a signature of unconscious decision.

The model: leaky stochastic accumulator crossing a threshold. Movement occurs when random fluctuations happen to reach threshold. Averaging across trials produces the RP shape, but each individual trial reflects noise, not decision. As Schurger puts it, the RP "may reflect ongoing stochastic fluctuations in neural activity that favor the spontaneous emission of a movement at certain times more so than at others."

This "takes the sting out of the Libet argument." The RP doesn't show the brain deciding before consciousness—it shows noise accumulating until movement becomes appropriate. What consciousness contributes is determining *when to let* that threshold-crossing happen.

### Surgical Evidence

Sjöberg (2024) provides additional evidence from patients with surgical resection of the supplementary motor area (SMA)—the region generating the RP. If the RP reflected genuine volition, removing it should impair voluntary action. It doesn't. Patients with SMA resection retain their sense of voluntary action.

Sjöberg concludes that Libet's findings are "completely irrelevant" to the free will debate. The RP tracks motor preparation, not decision-making.

## Where Intention Originates

Desmurget's 2009 neurosurgical studies reveal where conscious motor intention actually emerges.

### The Parietal Dissociation

Stimulating different brain regions produces strikingly different effects:

| Region | Effect of Stimulation |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Inferior parietal** | Conscious intention to move *without* movement |
| **Inferior parietal** (higher intensity) | False belief of having moved (no EMG activity) |
| **Premotor cortex** | Actual movement *without* awareness |

This is a double dissociation: parietal regions produce the experience of intention without motor output; premotor regions produce motor output without the experience of intention. The phenomenology of "deciding to move" is separable from the motor machinery that executes movement.

### Selection vs Execution

This dissociation maps directly onto the Map's framework. Consciousness contributes at the *selection* level—choosing what to do—not at the *execution* level—how to do it. The parietal cortex, where intention emerges, is part of the posterior "hot zone" that recent research associates with conscious content.

This explains why we experience choosing to reach for a cup but don't experience choosing the firing patterns of individual motor neurons. Consciousness operates at the level of action selection; execution is delegated to automatic systems. The quantum Zeno mechanism would operate at the selection interface, not the execution machinery.

## Neural Signatures of Motor Selection

### Willed vs Instructed Movement

Research on voluntary attention (Bengson 2019) found that willed attention—internally generated rather than externally cued—engages distinct neural mechanisms: frontal theta oscillations and bidirectional frontoparietal coherence. Motor control shows similar distinctions:

| Feature | Willed Action | Instructed Action |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| Frontal theta | Increased | Standard |
| Frontoparietal coherence | Bidirectional | Primarily feedforward |
| Decision processes | Additional frontal recruitment | Minimal frontal involvement |
| Timeline | ~300ms | ~100ms |

The bidirectional coherence finding is particularly significant. During willed action, information flows both ways between frontal executive regions and parietal motor planning regions. During instructed action, information flows primarily from instruction to execution. Willed action involves genuine neural "deliberation"; instructed action is more like relay.

### The 300ms Decision Window

Both willed attention and willed motor action take approximately 300ms to deploy—versus ~100ms for automatic responses. This temporal signature may reflect the time consciousness requires to engage the selection mechanism.

In the quantum Zeno framework, 300ms would be the time required for:
1. Candidate neural patterns to enter superposition
2. Consciousness to engage through attention/intention
3. Repeated observation to stabilize the selected pattern
4. The pattern to reach threshold for execution

## Quantum Zeno Applied

### Unified Selection Mechanism

[Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism](/concepts/stapp-quantum-mind/) proposes that mental attention operates like quantum observation—rapid, repeated "looks" at neural states hold desired patterns stable against their tendency to evolve into alternatives.

If attention is motor planning (PMTA), then the Zeno mechanism applies directly to motor selection. Attending to an action plan holds it stable. The same rapid observation that sustains attention to a visual target sustains preparation for a reaching movement.

The unified mechanism:

1. **Neural superposition.** Multiple motor programs exist in superposition (classical analog: competing representations in premotor populations).
2. **Attentional observation.** Directing attention to a motor plan constitutes observation of that neural state.
3. **Zeno stabilization.** Repeated observation prevents the plan from dissipating into alternatives.
4. **Threshold facilitation.** Sustained attention biases which population reaches threshold first.

This explains the common phenomenology. Sustaining motor intention feels effortful for the same reason sustaining attention feels effortful: both require continuous engagement to maintain Zeno freezing.

### Decoherence Considerations

The standard objection to quantum consciousness—rapid decoherence in warm brains—applies here. Tegmark's 2000 calculations suggested 10⁻¹³ second coherence times, far shorter than neural timescales.

However, Hameroff and colleagues (2014) challenged Tegmark's assumptions. Tegmark had used parameters appropriate for dead neural tissue at thermal equilibrium; corrected calculations for biological conditions yield decoherence times of 10⁻⁵ to 10⁻⁴ seconds—seven orders of magnitude longer. At 10⁻⁴ seconds, roughly 1000 quantum cycles could occur within a single motor commitment event.

A 2024 *Brain* study connects dopamine directly to oscillatory substrates. Both dopamine and deep brain stimulation shorten latencies between motor intention and motor execution by shifting cortico-subthalamic oscillatory flow from **antikinetic beta** (13-35 Hz) to **prokinetic theta** (4-10 Hz). The frontal theta signature observed in both willed attention (Bengson 2019) and motor preparation may be dopamine-facilitated, linking the neurotransmitter system to potential quantum mechanisms.

Additionally, the [post-decoherence selection response](/archive/concepts/psychophysical-coupling-mechanisms/) applies: consciousness might bias outcome selection *after* decoherence, at the moment of measurement collapse.

## The Phenomenology of Motor Choice

The [phenomenology of choice](/concepts/phenomenology-of-choice/) applies directly to motor selection. Willed movement has distinctive experiential character that passive observation lacks.

### Choosing to Move vs Observing Movement

When you decide to raise your arm, the experience differs fundamentally from watching someone else raise their arm—or even from watching your own arm move involuntarily:

| Feature | Willed Movement | Observed Movement |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Effort | Present, varies with difficulty | Absent |
| Authorship | Strong sense of ownership | Absent or weak |
| Temporal orientation | Directive, anticipatory | Receptive |
| Counterfactual sense | "I could have done otherwise" | "It happened" |

This phenomenological distinction tracks the neural distinction between willed and instructed action. The experience isn't merely a post-hoc narrative—it corresponds to real differences in brain function.

### Sense of Agency and Efference Copy

Motor selection produces a distinctive phenomenology: the sense of agency. We experience ourselves as the authors of our movements. This sense depends on efference copy—the brain's prediction of sensory consequences of motor commands.

When you move your arm:
1. Motor command is generated
2. Efference copy predicts expected sensory feedback
3. Actual feedback is compared to prediction
4. Match produces sense of agency; mismatch produces sense of passivity

Disrupted efference copy produces pathological experiences—alien hand syndrome, passivity experiences in schizophrenia—where movements feel imposed rather than willed.

From the Map's perspective, efference copy may be how consciousness "reads" whether selection succeeded. The selection mechanism operates at the decision point; efference copy provides feedback about whether the selected action occurred as intended.

### The Template for Action

Stapp describes consciousness holding a "template for action" stable through the quantum Zeno effect. This language captures the phenomenology well. When preparing to move, you maintain an intention—a representation of the desired action—until the appropriate moment for execution. The intention feels like something you *hold*, not something that happens to you.

This holding requires effort. Maintaining motor preparation against competing alternatives has phenomenal cost. The cost correlates with difficulty: preparing a novel, complex movement feels more effortful than a habitual one. This correlation between felt effort and actual cognitive demand suggests the phenomenology tracks something real about conscious contribution.

## The Illusionist Challenge

[Illusionists](/concepts/illusionism/) argue that the phenomenology of motor selection—effort, authorship, veto—is representational fiction. The brain generates *representations* of willed movement without consciousness actually selecting anything.

### The Regress Problem

If the sense of agency is illusory, what is the *seeming* of agency? Keith Frankish proposes "quasi-phenomenal properties"—introspectable states that seem phenomenal but aren't. But this relocates rather than eliminates the problem. The quasi-phenomenal seeming of effort must itself be explained. Either:
- The seeming has phenomenal character (we've moved the mystery, not solved it)
- The seeming has no phenomenal character (why is it so compelling?)

Raymond Tallis's point applies: "Misrepresentation presupposes presentation." To seem one way rather than another, there must be something it's like to seem.

### Why Effort Correlates with Difficulty

The correlation between felt effort and motor difficulty is striking. Novel movements feel harder than practiced ones. Complex sequences feel harder than simple actions. If phenomenology were disconnected from motor processing, this correlation would be coincidental.

The Zeno framework explains the correlation: difficult actions require more frequent observation events to maintain the selected pattern against competing alternatives. More observation events = more phenomenal engagement = greater felt effort.

### The Zombie Reformulation

Consider a philosophical zombie that exhibits all motor behaviour—willed and instructed alike—without any phenomenal experience. For the illusionist, there's no explanatory difference between the zombie and us. But then why does the zombie show the same neural signatures (frontal theta, bidirectional coherence) for "willed" versus "instructed" action?

The illusionist must claim these signatures are computational features that *generate* the illusion of effort. But the signatures exist in the zombie, which has no illusion. Either:
- The signatures cause phenomenology (contradicting illusionism)
- The signatures are unrelated to phenomenology (coincidental correlation)

## Process Philosophy Perspective

Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy offers another angle on motor selection. For Whitehead, reality consists of "actual occasions"—momentary events of experience that prehend (grasp) their causal past and contribute novelty to their causal future.

Each motor decision can be understood as an actual occasion achieving "concrescence"—the coming-together of multiple influences (competing motor programs, contextual factors, preparatory activity) into a definite outcome. The agent doesn't intervene in a pre-formed physical process from outside; the experiential and physical aspects are two poles of the same occasions.

The basal ganglia's brake-release model maps onto this framework. Multiple motor programs are "real potentials" in Whitehead's sense—genuine possibilities, not merely epistemic uncertainties. The disinhibition of one program while others remain suppressed is the moment of concrescence where potentials become actual.

The process view dissolves the problem of how non-physical consciousness could affect physical motor systems. On Whitehead's view, the experiential was never separate from the physical. Motor selection isn't consciousness *intervening* in physics; it's the experiential pole of neural occasions shaping how those occasions concresce.

## Relation to Site Perspective

### Dualism

The attention-motor unification supports the [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism) tenet. The dissociation between intention (parietal) and execution (premotor) suggests something contributes to intention that is not identical to motor execution machinery. If consciousness were identical to neural processing, there would be no principled distinction between experiencing intention and executing movement.

The common phenomenology is telling. Both willed attention and willed action feel like *you* doing something—not like watching computation unfold. The common phenomenology suggests a common agent behind both.

### Minimal Quantum Interaction

Motor selection satisfies the [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) constraint elegantly. Consciousness doesn't generate motor force or inject attention energy—it biases selection among patterns the brain already generates. The basal ganglia brake-release mechanism offers a site where small influences could determine which program is disinhibited.

The bandwidth constraint (~10 bits/second for conscious processing) matches the policy-level operation of both attention and motor control. You consciously select "attend to X" or "reach for Y"—you don't consciously direct individual saccade muscles or reaching trajectories.

### Bidirectional Interaction

The [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet finds direct support. Motor control is where consciousness visibly affects the physical world. Words appear on screens. Bodies move through space. This discussion exists because consciousness can influence motor output.

If motor selection and attentional selection share a mechanism, bidirectional interaction is unified: the same interface connects consciousness to both perception (via attention) and action (via motor selection).

### No Many Worlds

The quantum Zeno mechanism requires genuine collapse. If all branches actualize (many-worlds interpretation), there's nothing for consciousness to select—motor programs would execute in all branches, and consciousness would merely find itself in one. The [No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds) tenet preserves motor selection as genuine choice, not branch-discovery.

### Occam's Razor Has Limits

The "simpler" neural-determinism view cannot explain why the willed/instructed distinction exists neurally (why have it if epiphenomenal?), faces the evolutionary puzzle (why would accurate effort phenomenology evolve if causally inert?), and must treat the Desmurget dissociation as coincidence. The [Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits) tenet explains: parsimony is unreliable when our knowledge is incomplete. The motor selection framework adds mechanism but gains explanatory purchase.

### An Honest Gap

This framework identifies *where* consciousness might influence motor selection—at threshold-crossing moments when competing options resolve. It does not explain *how* a non-physical consciousness biases physical outcomes. That remains mysterious. The psychophysical interface—the point where mind and matter touch—is not illuminated, only located. This honest limitation distinguishes the Map's position from both eliminativism (which denies the problem) and facile solutions (which claim to solve what they merely relocate).
