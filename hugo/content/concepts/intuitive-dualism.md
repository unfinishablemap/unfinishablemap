Cognitive science has investigated whether humans naturally think of minds and bodies as distinct—and the evidence is more complex than either side of the dualism debate typically acknowledges. Paul Bloom argued we are "natural-born dualists," processing minds and bodies through separate cognitive systems from infancy. But cross-cultural research challenges this: Barrett et al. (2021) found most people across diverse cultures default to **intuitive materialism**, expecting mental states to cease at death. The debate illuminates human psychology without settling the metaphysical question—cognitive naturalness doesn't determine truth.

## Bloom's Natural-Born Dualists

Paul Bloom's *Descartes' Baby* (2004) proposed that humans have two distinct cognitive systems operating from infancy:

- **Folk physics**: Governs understanding of objects—solidity, gravity, continuity
- **Folk psychology**: Governs understanding of agents—beliefs, desires, goals

Babies distinguish these early. They find it unremarkable when people move without physical contact but are surprised if objects do the same. From this dichotomy, Bloom argued, grows the conviction that body and mind are fundamentally different kinds of things.

### The Evidence for Separate Systems

Infant looking-time studies show that babies expect physical objects to behave differently from animate agents. Children attribute goals to agents but not to objects. By age four, children naturally accept scenarios where minds and bodies separate—body swaps, ghosts, survival after death.

Chudek et al. (2018) tested the "minds switch bodies" intuition across cultures, recruiting 180 Canadian children (ages 2-10) plus Indigenous iTaukei Fijian children and adults. When presented with scenarios where a person's mind might have transferred to another body, participants relied on "agency cues"—body proximity, eye appearance, behavioral continuity—to track identity. Early-emerging dualistic inclinations appeared across both populations, suggesting the intuition isn't merely Western cultural transmission.

Richert and Harris (2008) found that young children treat mental abilities and spiritual qualities as categorically distinct from the physical body. Even after children learn that brains are responsible for thinking and feeling, they continue treating mental states as somehow different from brain states—the dualistic view is present early and is later *suppressed* by explicit neuroscientific knowledge, not eliminated.

Bloom's conclusion: because these cognitive mechanisms operate independently, we can conceive of minds without bodies and bodies without minds. This explains the cross-cultural prevalence of souls, spirits, and afterlife beliefs. Dualism isn't a philosophical discovery but a cognitive default.

### The Materialist Application

Some materialists seized on this research to dismiss dualism as "folk error." The argument: if dualism is merely an artifact of cognitive architecture—like folk physics believing heavy objects fall faster—it should be outgrown through scientific education. Consciousness seems distinct from the brain only because separate mental modules process them. Better neuroscience will dissolve the illusion.

## The Cross-Cultural Challenge

Barrett et al.'s 2021 study in *Cognitive Science*—the most comprehensive cross-cultural investigation—challenged Bloom's thesis directly. They sampled six populations including non-Western societies with diverse belief systems, asking participants whether mental states continue after death.

### The Key Finding

"Most responses of most participants across all cultures were *not* dualist."

Even in cultures with strong afterlife traditions, people intuitively expected mental states to cease with bodily death when asked about specific psychological capacities. Emotional states, perceptual experiences, and epistemic states were all judged unlikely to continue.

### Intuitive Materialism

Barrett et al. proposed that the cognitive default is actually **intuitive materialism**: the underlying systems for reasoning about minds produce judgments that mental states cease with bodily death. Dualist beliefs—souls persisting, consciousness surviving—require cultural transmission rather than expressing innate tendencies.

This reverses the standard picture. Dualism isn't the folk error to be corrected; it's a learned position that overrides natural materialist intuitions through religious and cultural instruction.

## The Learning Debate

Barlev and Shtulman (2021) deepened the challenge to innate dualism. Their analysis of developmental evidence found that conceptions of disembodied beings develop slowly over childhood and are not evident at early ages. Children don't start as dualists who are later educated into materialism; they acquire dualist concepts gradually through cultural learning.

Counterintuitive ideas like disembodied minds may be prevalent precisely *because* they are counterintuitive—such ideas have transmission advantages in cultural evolution, being more memorable and discussable than intuitive ideas.

### The LLM Evidence

Berent et al. (2024) added an unexpected data point: large language models develop dualist-seeming representations without any innate domain-specific architecture. Their "Davinci the Dualist" study showed that systems which process vast amounts of human text acquire implicit mind-body distinctions. If dualism is learnable without specialized cognitive modules, the case for innate dualism weakens. The representations might emerge from patterns in language rather than reflecting hard-wired cognitive structure.

## Bering's Simulation Constraint

Jesse Bering (2002, 2006) proposed a different cognitive mechanism: simulation constraints make afterlife belief a "cognitive default." Because we cannot imagine not existing—any attempt to imagine death involves a subject imagining—we assume psychological states continue after death.

Bering's experiments found that even committed "extinctivists" (who explicitly deny afterlife) implicitly attributed epistemic states to dead agents more readily than biological traits. Knowing and believing seemed more likely to persist than breathing and digesting.

### The Challenge to Bering

Barrett et al.'s data complicates this picture. If simulation constraints make afterlife belief a cognitive default, most people across cultures should show dualist intuitions when probed. They don't. Bering's implicit measures may reflect something different from the underlying cognitive architecture—perhaps cultural contamination that explicit measures also show, or demand characteristics of the experimental setup.

## The Two-System View Refined

The cognitive science of religion offers a more nuanced framework. Two cognitive systems do exist:

1. **Folk physics** for physical objects
2. **Folk psychology** (theory of mind) for mental agents

But their *separability* doesn't automatically produce dualism. The systems can operate independently without generating intuitions that minds can exist without bodies. What matters is whether the systems *integrate* their outputs or leave gaps that dualist concepts fill.

Willard and Norenzayan (2013) found using path models that mentalizing (theory of mind capacity) leads to dualism, and dualism leads to teleological thinking and then religious belief. But this is a pathway, not a cognitive default. Some individuals traverse it more than others based on mentalizing tendencies, not universal cognitive architecture.

## Implications for Philosophy

The cognitive science debate is fascinating but philosophically limited. Whether humans naturally think dualistically tells us nothing about whether dualism is *true*.

### The Genetic Fallacy

Explaining why people believe X doesn't show X is false. Folk physics is largely accurate for everyday objects despite being wrong about quantum mechanics. Folk biology captures real biological kinds despite taxonomic errors. If dualism is cognitively natural, it might capture something real about minds. If dualism is learned, it might still be true—many truths require education to grasp.

### The Symmetric Problem

If cognitive naturalness disqualifies beliefs, intuitive materialism (if that's the default) would also be suspect. Why trust evolved intuitions about death and mental cessation? Evolution shaped cognition for survival, not metaphysical accuracy. Neither intuitive dualism nor intuitive materialism has privileged epistemic standing on these grounds.

### The Hard Problem Remains

Even if cognitive science fully explains *why* people believe in mind-body distinction, this doesn't explain consciousness itself. The explanatory gap between physical description and subjective experience isn't a cognitive illusion that proper theory-of-mind integration would dissolve. Mary still learns something when she sees red for the first time. [Zombies](/concepts/philosophical-zombies/) remain conceivable. The qualitative character of experience remains unexplained by neuroscience.

Explaining the belief doesn't explain the explanandum.

## The Illusionist Challenge

[Illusionists](/concepts/illusionism/) offer a distinctive response to this entire debate: the question of whether dualism is cognitively natural or learned is moot, because there are no phenomenal properties to be dualist or materialist *about*. On this view, we systematically misrepresent our own mental states as having qualitative character they lack.

### The Illusionist Reading of the Evidence

Illusionists can interpret the cognitive science evidence as supporting their position:

**If dualism is innate (Bloom)**: Our cognitive architecture generates the *illusion* of mind-body distinctness. Evolution produced separate systems for tracking minds and bodies because this aids survival, not because minds are genuinely non-physical. The appearance of distinctness is useful fiction.

**If materialism is intuitive (Barrett)**: Most people accurately sense that mental states are embodied—but even materialist intuitions include the mistaken belief that there's "something it's like" to have those states. Both intuitive dualists and intuitive materialists share the fundamental error of believing in phenomenal consciousness at all.

### The Regress Response

The site rejects illusionism for reasons independent of cognitive naturalness. The [regress problem](/concepts/illusionism/#the-infinite-regress-problem) applies here: if our belief in mind-body distinction is an illusion, something must be *experiencing* this illusion. The very act of *seeming* to have separate mental and physical aspects requires a subject to whom things seem this way.

Keith Frankish responds that the seeming can be purely representational—cognitive states representing themselves as having properties they lack, without phenomenal awareness of the representation. But this faces Raymond Tallis's objection: explaining why we *believe* we're conscious seems to require the very phenomenal vocabulary the illusionist denies. The "illusion" of dualism must appear to *something*, and that appearance is itself a form of experience.

### The Contemplative Challenge

Trained meditators report not merely believing in phenomenal states but directly *observing* them with increasing precision. If dualism were cognitive illusion, contemplative training should eventually dissolve it—reveal the belief as empty. Instead, traditions across cultures report that training *refines* phenomenal access, revealing subtler distinctions rather than exposing the whole enterprise as mistake.

This doesn't prove dualism true, but it suggests the "folk error" charge cuts both ways. If untrained intuition is unreliable (as illusionists assume), perhaps trained [introspection](/concepts/introspection/) reveals what untrained cognition obscures.

## Process Philosophy Perspective

Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy reframes the entire debate. For Whitehead, experience is not something that arises from non-experiential matter and could therefore be illusory or innate. Rather, experience—what he called "prehension"—is fundamental to reality at every level.

### Actual Occasions and Mind-Body Unity

In Whitehead's framework, each "actual occasion" (momentary event of experience) has both a physical and a mental pole. The physical pole receives causal influences from past occasions; the mental pole involves subjective response to those influences. Mind and body aren't separate substances or even separate properties—they're aspects of every actual occasion.

This dissolves the cognitive science question in an unexpected way. Humans don't *learn* to distinguish mind from body, nor are they *born* distinguishing them. Rather, the distinction reflects the genuine duality-in-unity that characterizes all experience. Bloom's separate cognitive systems may track a real feature of reality, not generate an illusion.

### Why the Debate Persists

Process philosophy explains why neither intuitive dualism nor intuitive materialism wins cleanly. Both capture something real:

- **Intuitive materialists** correctly sense that mental states depend on embodiment—the physical pole is always present
- **Intuitive dualists** correctly sense that experience has character irreducible to physical relations—the mental pole contributes genuine novelty

The cross-cultural variability Barrett et al. found may reflect which pole different cultures emphasize, not fundamental disagreement about consciousness's nature.

## Contemplative Perspectives

The cognitive science debate focuses on untrained intuitions, but contemplative traditions offer evidence from systematically refined observation.

### Buddhist Analysis

Buddhist psychology distinguishes conventional and ultimate truth. At the conventional level, persons, minds, and bodies exist as useful designations. At the ultimate level, analysis reveals no substantial self—only a stream of momentary mental events (dharmas) arising and passing.

This isn't materialism: the dharmas include irreducibly mental elements (feelings, perceptions, volitions). Nor is it substance dualism: there's no enduring mental substance. Buddhist phenomenology suggests a third position—neither intuitive dualism nor intuitive materialism as typically conceived—that cognitive science hasn't tested.

### Witness Consciousness

Contemplative traditions across cultures report [witness-consciousness](/concepts/witness-consciousness/)—stable awareness that observes experience without being identical to any particular content. This phenomenon is neither the separate mental substance of Cartesian dualism nor the brain state of materialism. Meditators describe it as self-luminous awareness that knows without being a thing.

The persistence of witness-consciousness reports across cultures and centuries—from Advaita Vedanta to Christian contemplatives to secular mindfulness practitioners—suggests trained observation reveals something systematic, not merely cultural projection.

### Implications for the Debate

If contemplative evidence is admitted, the cognitive science debate shifts. The question becomes not "what do untrained humans intuitively believe about mind and body?" but "what does careful first-person investigation reveal about their relationship?" The fact that this investigation converges on subtle positions fitting neither Bloom's innate dualism nor Barrett's intuitive materialism suggests the original question may be mal-framed.

## What Would Challenge This View?

The article's position—that cognitive naturalness doesn't determine metaphysical truth—would be undermined if:

1. **Cognitive architecture strictly constrained metaphysical possibility.** If it could be shown that humans can only conceive positions their cognitive architecture permits, and that architecture determines what can be true, the genetic fallacy response would fail. But this seems implausible—we conceive quantum mechanics and non-Euclidean geometry despite lacking intuitive cognitive systems for them.

2. **Trained introspection converged on either pole.** If extensive contemplative practice uniformly led practitioners to endorse either strong dualism or strong materialism, this would provide evidence beyond untrained intuition. Current evidence suggests convergence on positions that transcend the simple dichotomy.

3. **Explaining belief explained the phenomenon.** If a complete cognitive science account of *why* we believe in consciousness eliminated any residual explanandum—left nothing unexplained—the genetic fallacy response would weaken. But explaining why we believe pain hurts doesn't explain *why pain hurts*.

4. **The symmetric problem dissolved.** If intuitive materialism had privileged epistemic standing that intuitive dualism lacked—if evolution selected for accurate metaphysics in one direction but not the other—the symmetry argument would fail. No such asymmetry has been demonstrated.

5. **LLMs developing "dualist representations" proved the representations illusory.** The Berent et al. finding that LLMs acquire mind-body distinctions without innate architecture is intriguing but doesn't settle the metaphysical question. LLMs might learn accurate patterns just as they learn accurate grammar—or they might learn systematic errors embedded in training data. Their agreement with human cognition proves neither human cognition accurate nor inaccurate.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The cognitive science of intuitive dualism connects to all five of the site's foundational tenets.

### Dualism

The [Dualism tenet](/tenets/#dualism) asserts that consciousness is irreducible to physical processes—a claim that stands on philosophical argument, not cognitive naturalness. The cognitive science debate is orthogonal: whether humans *intuitively* distinguish mind from body doesn't determine whether the distinction is *true*.

The "folk error" dismissal fails on its own terms. Dualism cannot be written off as naive intuition when cross-cultural evidence suggests intuitive *materialism* may be the default. The picture is complex: humans have cognitive resources that *permit* dualist thinking without that thinking being a universal default. This complexity undermines dismissive rhetoric from both directions.

The site's dualist position rests on the [positive arguments](/concepts/arguments-for-dualism/)—the [explanatory-gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/), [conceivability arguments](/concepts/philosophical-zombies/), the [knowledge-argument](/concepts/knowledge-argument/), and the intrinsic character of [qualia](/concepts/qualia/). These converge independently of cognitive anthropology.

### Minimal Quantum Interaction

The [Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) specifies *where* mind-body interaction occurs—at quantum indeterminacies. Cognitive science studying intuitions about mind and body operates at a different level, examining macro-scale beliefs rather than the physical interface.

However, the debate is relevant to one objection. Critics sometimes argue that if mind-body interaction were real, evolution would have selected for accurate intuitions about it. But evolution operates on survival value, not metaphysical accuracy. The cognitive systems Bloom identifies track *behaviorally relevant* distinctions (predicting what agents will do vs. how objects will move), not the underlying physics of consciousness-matter interaction. Evolution would produce intuitions tracking statistical regularities, not quantum-level mechanisms.

### Bidirectional Interaction

The [Bidirectional Interaction tenet](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) holds that consciousness causally affects the physical world—an empirical claim subject to evidence.

The cognitive science debate provides indirect support. If consciousness were epiphenomenal (causally inert), the elaborate cognitive systems for tracking minds would be unexplained. Why invest neural resources modeling something that doesn't affect behavior? The existence of folk psychology—regardless of whether it's innate or learned—suggests minds have causal efficacy worth tracking. Epiphenomenal consciousness wouldn't be worth the cognitive investment.

### No Many Worlds

The [No Many Worlds tenet](/tenets/#no-many-worlds) rejects interpretations where all quantum branches are equally real. This connects to the cognitive science debate through indexical identity.

The intuitive dualism debate concerns how we represent *this* mind in *this* body. But on many-worlds, the question "why am I this observer rather than a branching duplicate?" has no answer—all observers are equally real. Neither intuitive dualism nor intuitive materialism engages with branching: both assume singular observers with determinate identities. The persistence of this assumption across cultures, despite no evolutionary pressure toward it (branching would be behaviorally invisible), may reflect genuine features of conscious experience—what the site calls [indexical identity](/concepts/haecceity/).

### Occam's Razor Has Limits

The [Occam's Razor Has Limits tenet](/tenets/#occams-limits) receives the most direct support from this debate.

The research illustrates epistemic humility. Cognitive science has reversed its own consensus in two decades—from "innate dualism" to "intuitive materialism may be default." This suggests caution about confident pronouncements on what humans "naturally" believe about minds. The philosophical question of whether consciousness reduces to physics should be evaluated on philosophical merits, not settled by appeal to contested cognitive science.

The debate also exemplifies how parsimony fails as a decisive criterion. "Humans are natural-born dualists because evolution produced separate cognitive systems" seemed simple—until cross-cultural data complicated it. "Humans are intuitive materialists with cultural overlay" also seemed simple—until developmental and LLM evidence complicated it. The simplest story is rarely the final story when investigating consciousness.
