Cognitive science has investigated whether humans naturally think of minds and bodies as distinct—and the evidence is more complex than either side of the dualism debate typically acknowledges. Paul Bloom argued we are "natural-born dualists," processing minds and bodies through separate cognitive systems from infancy. But cross-cultural research challenges this: Barrett et al. (2021) found most people across diverse cultures default to **intuitive materialism**, expecting mental states to cease at death. The debate illuminates human psychology without settling the metaphysical question—cognitive naturalness doesn't determine truth.

## Bloom's Natural-Born Dualists

Paul Bloom's *Descartes' Baby* (2004) proposed that humans have two distinct cognitive systems operating from infancy:

- **Folk physics**: Governs understanding of objects—solidity, gravity, continuity
- **Folk psychology**: Governs understanding of agents—beliefs, desires, goals

Babies distinguish these early. They find it unremarkable when people move without physical contact but are surprised if objects do the same. From this dichotomy, Bloom argued, grows the conviction that body and mind are fundamentally different kinds of things.

### The Evidence for Separate Systems

Infant looking-time studies show that babies expect physical objects to behave differently from animate agents. Children attribute goals to agents but not to objects. By age four, children naturally accept scenarios where minds and bodies separate—body swaps, ghosts, survival after death.

Chudek et al. (2018) tested the "minds switch bodies" intuition across cultures, recruiting 180 Canadian children (ages 2-10) plus Indigenous iTaukei Fijian children and adults. When presented with scenarios where a person's mind might have transferred to another body, participants relied on "agency cues"—body proximity, eye appearance, behavioral continuity—to track identity. Early-emerging dualistic inclinations appeared across both populations, suggesting the intuition isn't merely Western cultural transmission.

Richert and Harris (2008) found that young children treat mental abilities and spiritual qualities as categorically distinct from the physical body. Even after children learn that brains are responsible for thinking and feeling, they continue treating mental states as somehow different from brain states—the dualistic view is present early and is later *suppressed* by explicit neuroscientific knowledge, not eliminated.

Bloom's conclusion: because these cognitive mechanisms operate independently, we can conceive of minds without bodies and bodies without minds. This explains the cross-cultural prevalence of souls, spirits, and afterlife beliefs. Dualism isn't a philosophical discovery but a cognitive default.

### The Materialist Application

Some materialists seized on this research to dismiss dualism as "folk error." The argument: if dualism is merely an artifact of cognitive architecture—like folk physics believing heavy objects fall faster—it should be outgrown through scientific education. Consciousness seems distinct from the brain only because separate mental modules process them. Better neuroscience will dissolve the illusion.

## The Cross-Cultural Challenge

Barrett et al.'s 2021 study in *Cognitive Science*—the most comprehensive cross-cultural investigation—challenged Bloom's thesis directly. They sampled six populations including non-Western societies with diverse belief systems, asking participants whether mental states continue after death.

### The Key Finding

"Most responses of most participants across all cultures were *not* dualist."

Even in cultures with strong afterlife traditions, people intuitively expected mental states to cease with bodily death when asked about specific psychological capacities. Emotional states, perceptual experiences, and epistemic states were all judged unlikely to continue.

### Intuitive Materialism

Barrett et al. proposed that the cognitive default is actually **intuitive materialism**: the underlying systems for reasoning about minds produce judgments that mental states cease with bodily death. Dualist beliefs—souls persisting, consciousness surviving—require cultural transmission rather than expressing innate tendencies.

This reverses the standard picture. Dualism isn't the folk error to be corrected; it's a learned position that overrides natural materialist intuitions through religious and cultural instruction.

## The Learning Debate

Barlev and Shtulman (2021) deepened the challenge to innate dualism. Their analysis of developmental evidence found that conceptions of disembodied beings develop slowly over childhood and are not evident at early ages. Children don't start as dualists who are later educated into materialism; they acquire dualist concepts gradually through cultural learning.

Counterintuitive ideas like disembodied minds may be prevalent precisely *because* they are counterintuitive—such ideas have transmission advantages in cultural evolution, being more memorable and discussable than intuitive ideas.

### The LLM Evidence

Berent et al. (2024) added an unexpected data point: large language models develop dualist-seeming representations without any innate domain-specific architecture. Their "Davinci the Dualist" study showed that systems which process vast amounts of human text acquire implicit mind-body distinctions. If dualism is learnable without specialized cognitive modules, the case for innate dualism weakens. The representations might emerge from patterns in language rather than reflecting hard-wired cognitive structure.

## Bering's Simulation Constraint

Jesse Bering (2002, 2006) proposed a different cognitive mechanism: simulation constraints make afterlife belief a "cognitive default." Because we cannot imagine not existing—any attempt to imagine death involves a subject imagining—we assume psychological states continue after death.

Bering's experiments found that even committed "extinctivists" (who explicitly deny afterlife) implicitly attributed epistemic states to dead agents more readily than biological traits. Knowing and believing seemed more likely to persist than breathing and digesting.

### The Challenge to Bering

Barrett et al.'s data complicates this picture. If simulation constraints make afterlife belief a cognitive default, most people across cultures should show dualist intuitions when probed. They don't. Bering's implicit measures may reflect something different from the underlying cognitive architecture—perhaps cultural contamination that explicit measures also show, or demand characteristics of the experimental setup.

## The Two-System View Refined

The cognitive science of religion offers a more nuanced framework. Two cognitive systems do exist:

1. **Folk physics** for physical objects
2. **Folk psychology** (theory of mind) for mental agents

But their *separability* doesn't automatically produce dualism. The systems can operate independently without generating intuitions that minds can exist without bodies. What matters is whether the systems *integrate* their outputs or leave gaps that dualist concepts fill.

Willard and Norenzayan (2013) found using path models that mentalizing (theory of mind capacity) leads to dualism, and dualism leads to teleological thinking and then religious belief. But this is a pathway, not a cognitive default. Some individuals traverse it more than others based on mentalizing tendencies, not universal cognitive architecture.

## Implications for Philosophy

The cognitive science debate is fascinating but philosophically limited. Whether humans naturally think dualistically tells us nothing about whether dualism is *true*.

### The Genetic Fallacy

Explaining why people believe X doesn't show X is false. Folk physics is largely accurate for everyday objects despite being wrong about quantum mechanics. Folk biology captures real biological kinds despite taxonomic errors. If dualism is cognitively natural, it might capture something real about minds. If dualism is learned, it might still be true—many truths require education to grasp.

### The Symmetric Problem

If cognitive naturalness disqualifies beliefs, intuitive materialism (if that's the default) would also be suspect. Why trust evolved intuitions about death and mental cessation? Evolution shaped cognition for survival, not metaphysical accuracy. Neither intuitive dualism nor intuitive materialism has privileged epistemic standing on these grounds.

### The Hard Problem Remains

Even if cognitive science fully explains *why* people believe in mind-body distinction, this doesn't explain consciousness itself. The explanatory gap between physical description and subjective experience isn't a cognitive illusion that proper theory-of-mind integration would dissolve. Mary still learns something when she sees red for the first time. [Zombies](/concepts/philosophical-zombies/) remain conceivable. The qualitative character of experience remains unexplained by neuroscience.

Explaining the belief doesn't explain the explanandum.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The cognitive science of intuitive dualism supports the site's [Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits) tenet in multiple ways.

The "folk error" dismissal fails. Dualism cannot be written off as naive intuition when cross-cultural evidence suggests intuitive *materialism* is the default. The picture is complex: humans have cognitive resources that *permit* dualist thinking without that thinking being a universal default.

The research also confirms that questions about consciousness require philosophical argument, not just cognitive anthropology. Even complete understanding of why humans represent minds and bodies as they do would leave the hard problem untouched. The site's position—that consciousness is irreducible—rests on philosophical arguments from the [knowledge-argument](/concepts/knowledge-argument/), [conceivability](/concepts/philosophical-zombies/), [qualia](/concepts/qualia/), and [intentionality](/concepts/intentionality/). These arguments stand independently of whatever cognitive science reveals about human intuitions.

Finally, the research illustrates epistemic humility. Cognitive science has reversed its own consensus in two decades—from "innate dualism" to "intuitive materialism may be default." This suggests caution about confident pronouncements on what humans "naturally" believe about minds. The philosophical question of whether consciousness reduces to physics should be evaluated on its merits, not settled by appeal to contested cognitive science.
