Agent causation holds that conscious agents—understood as persisting substances rather than collections of events—directly cause their actions. The agent is the causal source, not reducible to prior mental events like beliefs and desires. This positions agents as initiators of causal chains, not merely links in chains that stretch back before their existence.

This site's [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet is essentially agent-causal: consciousness genuinely selects outcomes. The site's framework specifies *how* this selection occurs—through quantum indeterminacies—while agent-causal philosophy provides the conceptual framework for *what* is happening: substances exercising irreducible causal powers.

## The Distinction: Agent vs. Event Causation

Most causal explanations appeal to events causing events. The cue ball struck the eight ball; the eight ball moved. My desire for coffee caused me to stand; standing caused walking to the kitchen. This is *event causation* or *transeunt causation* (Chisholm's term): events bring about other events through law-governed regularities.

Agent causation—*immanent causation*—is different. The agent, as a persisting substance, directly causes the action. The causation doesn't reduce to prior events in the agent's history. When I decide to raise my hand, it's not that "a decision event" caused "a raising event"; rather, *I* caused the raising. The agent is ontologically prior to the events, not a mere sum of them.

### Why This Matters for Free Will

Event-causal libertarianism (defended by Robert Kane, Mark Balaguer) holds that free actions are caused by mental events—beliefs, desires, intentions—but that these causal processes are nondeterministic. The indeterminism provides openness; the mental event provides causation.

But critics argue this doesn't deliver genuine authorship. If my decision is caused by prior mental events, and I didn't choose those events, how am I the ultimate source? The causal chain still traces back to things outside my control. I'm a conduit for causes, not a source of them.

Agent causation answers this challenge. The agent is the source—an "uncaused cause" or "unmoved mover" in the traditional terminology. The regress of causes stops at the agent, who initiates the causal chain through an irreducible capacity to act.

## Major Defenders

### Roderick Chisholm

Chisholm revived agent causation in his 1964 Lindley Lecture, "Human Freedom and the Self." He distinguished transeunt causation (event→event) from immanent causation (agent→event), arguing that free action requires the latter. If we have "the prerogative which some would attribute only to God: each of us, when we act, is a prime mover unmoved."

### Timothy O'Connor

O'Connor's *Persons and Causes* (2000) developed a sophisticated agent-causal account. More recently (2021), he adopted a neo-Aristotelian framework treating *all* causation as fundamentally substance causation—agents exercising causal powers. Event causation becomes derivative: we speak of events causing events, but this is shorthand for substances doing things that bring about other things.

### E.J. Lowe

Lowe's *Personal Agency* (2008) argues that all causation is fundamentally substance causation. "Substances, not events, are the causal source of all change in the world—with rational, free agents having a special place as unmoved movers." On this view, agent causation isn't metaphysically exceptional; it's paradigmatic of causation generally.

### William Hasker

Hasker's "emergent dualism" combines agent causation with an emergentist picture. The soul emerges from brain complexity but is ontologically distinct from it. Unlike Cartesian dualism, the soul has natural origins; unlike materialism, it's irreducible. This supports free will through the unity of consciousness argument: only a genuinely unified agent, not a collection of subsystems, can exercise unified agency.

## The Luck Objection

The central challenge to libertarian free will is the *luck objection*. If indeterminism leaves outcomes undetermined, then nothing about the agent explains which choice occurs. The outcome is lucky or arbitrary—not the agent's doing any more than a determined outcome would be.

Alfred Mele's version: Consider two possible worlds identical up to the moment of decision. In one, the agent chooses A; in the other, B. Nothing about the agent differs between worlds. So what explains the difference? Nothing—it's just luck. But lucky choices aren't free choices.

Agent-causal libertarians respond that the agent *does* explain the difference. In one world, the agent caused A; in the other, the agent caused B. The agent's causing is the explanation. This isn't reducible to prior events (which were identical), but it's not arbitrary—it's the agent exercising causal power.

Critics find this unsatisfying. "The agent caused it" seems to push the explanatory question back rather than answer it. What about the agent explains why they caused A rather than B?

### The Site's Response

The site's framework strengthens the agent-causal response. Consciousness doesn't randomly select quantum outcomes—it genuinely *chooses* based on reasons. The selection is neither determined (physics didn't fix the outcome) nor lucky (consciousness selected based on what matters to it).

The [luck objection article](/concepts/luck-objection/) develops this response across four dimensions:

1. **Selection vs randomness**: Lucky indeterminism involves passive reception of random outcomes; consciousness-selected indeterminism involves active choosing. The relationship to indeterminacy is fundamentally different.

2. **Phenomenology of effort**: Random processes don't feel like anything in particular—certainly not like work. But choosing feels effortful. The [phenomenology of effort](/concepts/mental-effort/)—sustained attention requiring ongoing engagement—distinguishes selection from luck. Lucky events don't feel like achievements; selections do.

3. **Reasons-guided selection**: Consciousness selects based on reasons—the same reasons that make actions intelligible. Why A rather than B? Because the agent had reasons for A. This makes selection contrastively explicable, unlike pure chance.

4. **Retrocausal deepening**: If [selection is atemporal](/concepts/retrocausality/)—determining which temporal history becomes real—then asking "what about the prior state explains the choice?" misframes the situation. The prior state is part of what consciousness selected.

This differs from the standard agent-causal response ("the agent caused it") by specifying *how* the agent's causation is non-arbitrary. The agent selects based on reasons, with phenomenal engagement, at quantum indeterminacies. The explanatory buck stops at the agent's exercise of causal power—but that exercise is reasons-responsive, not random.

## Substance Causation and the Site's Framework

Lowe and O'Connor's substance causation view has profound implications. If all causation is fundamentally substances exercising powers, then consciousness causing physical events isn't metaphysically exceptional—it's how causation works generally.

This reframes the [causal closure objection](/archive/arguments/interactionist-dualism/#the-causal-closure-argument). The objection assumes event causation is fundamental: every physical event must have a prior physical event cause. But if substance causation is fundamental, this assumption fails. Physics describes regularities in what substances do; it doesn't prove substances are exclusively physical.

The site's quantum mechanism specifies *where* agent causation interfaces with physics: at quantum indeterminacies, where physics leaves outcomes undetermined. The agent—the conscious substance—selects among quantum possibilities. This isn't consciousness "adding" to physical causation; it's consciousness exercising the same kind of causal power that all substances exercise, at points where physics doesn't determine the outcome.

## Agent Causation and Sourcehood

Robert Kane emphasizes *sourcehood* as the core requirement for free will: the agent must be the ultimate source of their actions, not merely a link in causal chains originating elsewhere. This condition is satisfied if the agent is an "uncaused cause"—but event-causal libertarianism struggles to provide this.

Agent causation provides sourcehood directly. The agent is the source because the agent, as substance, initiates the causal chain. Prior events influence but don't determine; the agent determines by exercising irreducible causal power.

The site's framework satisfies both of Kane's conditions for free will:
- **Sourcehood**: Consciousness is the ultimate source because it selects which quantum outcome becomes actual
- **Alternative possibilities**: Multiple outcomes were genuinely possible until selection occurred

The retrocausal dimension (see [retrocausality](/concepts/retrocausality/)) adds depth. If consciousness's selection is atemporal—if it determines which temporal history becomes real—then the agent is even more radically the source. Not just "the first cause in this chain" but "the cause of there being this chain at all."

## Skill Delegation and the Interface

A challenge for agent causation: if the agent causes actions, why don't agents consciously control every detail of skilled performance? When I type this sentence, I don't select each keystroke; my fingers "know" where to go. Does this automaticity undermine agent causation?

The [implicit memory](/concepts/implicit-memory/) framework resolves this tension. Tulving's Dreyfus model charts how consciousness relates to procedural skills across development. Novices consciously follow explicit rules; experts act fluidly without deliberation. But this progression represents *delegation*, not *absence*. Consciousness trains the procedural system, then withdraws from moment-to-moment execution while retaining override capacity.

### The Choking Phenomenon as Evidence

The "choking under pressure" phenomenon provides striking support for agent causation. When skilled performers consciously attend to automatized actions, performance degrades. The expert golfer thinking about their swing, the concert pianist monitoring finger placement—both perform worse than when acting unreflectively.

This degradation proves consciousness isn't epiphenomenal. If attention were causally inert, attending to skills couldn't interfere with them. The fact that conscious engagement *disrupts* procedural execution demonstrates causal efficacy—precisely what agent causation claims. Consciousness doesn't merely observe action; it can intervene, sometimes unhelpfully.

### Anoetic Consciousness and Continuous Subjecthood

Crucially, even during automatic performance, the agent persists. Tulving associated implicit memory with *anoetic consciousness*: experiential but non-reflective. There remains something it is like to perform a well-practiced skill; the mode is simply different from self-aware deliberation.

This matters for agent causation's metaphysics. The agent—the substance exercising causal powers—continues throughout skilled performance, maintaining the embodied engagement that expert action requires. Automaticity isn't the absence of the agent but a mode of the agent's engagement: consciousness having calibrated the system well enough that moment-to-moment selection becomes unnecessary.

The agent remains the source. They trained the skill, they sustain the embodied context within which it executes, and they retain the capacity to re-engage—as choking demonstrates. Delegation presupposes a delegator.

## Voluntary Attention as Agent-Causal Paradigm

If agent causation is real, we should find its clearest expression in cases where consciousness initiates action without external prompting. [Voluntary attention](/concepts/attention-as-interface/)—choosing where to direct awareness—provides exactly this paradigm case. Recent neuroscience distinguishes "willed attention" (internally chosen) from "instructed attention" (externally cued), finding distinct neural signatures for genuine decision-making.

### The Temporal Signature of Choosing

Endogenous (voluntary) attention takes approximately 300ms to deploy fully, compared to 100ms for exogenous (automatic) capture. This slower deployment time isn't inefficiency—it reflects decision processes. The additional 200ms corresponds to frontal theta oscillations (~500ms post-cue) that mark genuine choosing rather than reflexive response.

Crucially, voluntary attention can be sustained at will. Exogenous capture is transient, generating "inhibition of return" after ~300ms—the brain actively suppresses the captured location. But willed attention maintains focus as long as the agent continues engaging. This sustained character matches what agent causation predicts: the agent actively maintains the causal engagement.

### Neural Signatures of Willing

Research reveals three neural components specific to willed attention, with clear contrasts to instructed behaviour:

| Feature | Willed Attention | Instructed Attention |
|---------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Frontal theta** | Increased (~500ms post-cue) | Lower |
| **Frontoparietal coherence** | Bidirectional information flow | More unidirectional |
| **Decision processes** | Additional frontal engagement | Standard top-down control |

These findings converge on a key point: the brain distinguishes between doing what you're told and doing what you choose. The neural signature of genuine choosing is real and measurable.

Additionally:

1. **Frontal theta oscillations**: When participants choose where to attend (rather than following instructions), frontal theta power increases—marking the decision process itself
2. **Bidirectional frontoparietal coherence**: Information flows both ways between frontal executive regions and parietal attention control areas during willed attention, consistent with genuine feedback rather than one-way command
3. **Pre-prompt alpha states**: Ongoing neural activity predicts subsequent free choices, raising the question of whether "choice" is merely post-hoc rationalization

The third finding parallels the [Libet experiments](/concepts/libet-experiments/): if neural states predict choices before awareness, where is the agent?

### The Selection-Among-Options Resolution

The site's framework accommodates predictive neural states through the selection-among-options model. Pre-prompt alpha activity doesn't generate choices from nothing—it establishes the options available for selection. Stochastic neural fluctuations create a menu; consciousness selects from that menu.

This differs from both:
- **Libertarian ex nihilo**: Choice created from nothing (vulnerable to luck objection)
- **Deterministic reduction**: Choice as inevitable outcome of prior states

Instead: prior neural states constrain possibilities; consciousness selects among real alternatives. The agent is source of the selection even if not source of the options.

The 300ms deployment time becomes interpretable: consciousness needs that duration to engage with the prepared options and make selection effective. This matches Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism, where sustained observation influences outcome probabilities—observation that takes time to have causal effect.

### The Phenomenology of Directing vs Being Captured

First-person experience distinguishes willed from captured attention. When a loud noise draws attention, there's a sense of being *pulled*—you didn't do it, it happened to you. When you choose to focus on a difficult text, you experience *directing*—active engagement that feels like it originates from you.

This phenomenological distinction maps onto the neural distinction between ventral (capture) and dorsal (voluntary) attention networks. The experience of agency corresponds to actual mechanistic differences in how attention is deployed. Agent causation predicts exactly this: there should be phenomenological markers of genuine agency that correspond to real causal differences.

### Agent Causation Naturalized

The voluntary attention literature provides something agent-causal philosophy traditionally lacked: naturalistic mechanism. Rather than positing "irreducible substance causation" as primitive, we can identify:

- **Where**: Frontal cortex decision regions, with thalamus as relay between top-down and bottom-up signals
- **When**: The 300ms deployment window and sustained engagement period
- **How**: Theta oscillations mediating frontoparietal communication
- **Why effortful**: Sustained engagement requires continuous activity maintenance

This doesn't reduce consciousness to neural activity—the hard problem remains. But it shows how agent causation integrates with rather than floats above neuroscience. The agent acts *through* attention networks, leaving distinctive signatures of genuine decision-making.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Agent causation is the philosophical tradition to which this site belongs. The [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet—that consciousness causally influences the physical world—is a claim of agent causation: the conscious subject, as substance, causes physical events.

What the site adds is mechanism. Traditional agent causation lacked an account of *where* or *how* the agent interfaces with the physical world. The [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) tenet provides this: at quantum indeterminacies, where physics specifies probabilities but not outcomes. The [quantum consciousness mechanisms](/concepts/quantum-consciousness/) (Stapp, Penrose-Hameroff) describe how this might work in detail.

The [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism) tenet is also essential. Agent causation requires the agent to be ontologically distinct from physical events—otherwise, "agent causation" collapses into event causation. Substance dualism provides this: consciousness is a substance that exercises causal powers, not a property of physical substances. Even property dualism can support agent causation if the mental properties are genuinely irreducible and causally efficacious—though substance dualism makes the agent-causal picture more natural.

The [Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits) tenet addresses the main objection to agent causation: that it's metaphysically extravagant, positing a primitive relation unlike anything else in nature. But if we take consciousness seriously—if the hard problem is genuine—then consciousness already requires something beyond standard physics. Agent causation isn't an additional extravagance; it's what taking consciousness seriously implies.
