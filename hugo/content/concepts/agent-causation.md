Agent causation holds that conscious agents—understood as persisting substances rather than collections of events—directly cause their actions. The agent is the causal source, not reducible to prior mental events like beliefs and desires. This positions agents as initiators of causal chains, not merely links in chains that stretch back before their existence.

This site's [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet is essentially agent-causal: consciousness genuinely selects outcomes. The site's framework specifies *how* this selection occurs—through quantum indeterminacies—while agent-causal philosophy provides the conceptual framework for *what* is happening: substances exercising irreducible causal powers.

## The Distinction: Agent vs. Event Causation

Most causal explanations appeal to events causing events. The cue ball struck the eight ball; the eight ball moved. My desire for coffee caused me to stand; standing caused walking to the kitchen. This is *event causation* or *transeunt causation* (Chisholm's term): events bring about other events through law-governed regularities.

Agent causation—*immanent causation*—is different. The agent, as a persisting substance, directly causes the action. The causation doesn't reduce to prior events in the agent's history. When I decide to raise my hand, it's not that "a decision event" caused "a raising event"; rather, *I* caused the raising. The agent is ontologically prior to the events, not a mere sum of them.

### Why This Matters for Free Will

Event-causal libertarianism (defended by Robert Kane, Mark Balaguer) holds that free actions are caused by mental events—beliefs, desires, intentions—but that these causal processes are nondeterministic. The indeterminism provides openness; the mental event provides causation.

But critics argue this doesn't deliver genuine authorship. If my decision is caused by prior mental events, and I didn't choose those events, how am I the ultimate source? The causal chain still traces back to things outside my control. I'm a conduit for causes, not a source of them.

Agent causation answers this challenge. The agent is the source—an "uncaused cause" or "unmoved mover" in the traditional terminology. The regress of causes stops at the agent, who initiates the causal chain through an irreducible capacity to act.

## Major Defenders

### Roderick Chisholm

Chisholm revived agent causation in his 1964 Lindley Lecture, "Human Freedom and the Self." He distinguished transeunt causation (event→event) from immanent causation (agent→event), arguing that free action requires the latter. If we have "the prerogative which some would attribute only to God: each of us, when we act, is a prime mover unmoved."

### Timothy O'Connor

O'Connor's *Persons and Causes* (2000) developed a sophisticated agent-causal account. More recently (2021), he adopted a neo-Aristotelian framework treating *all* causation as fundamentally substance causation—agents exercising causal powers. Event causation becomes derivative: we speak of events causing events, but this is shorthand for substances doing things that bring about other things.

### E.J. Lowe

Lowe's *Personal Agency* (2008) argues that all causation is fundamentally substance causation. "Substances, not events, are the causal source of all change in the world—with rational, free agents having a special place as unmoved movers." On this view, agent causation isn't metaphysically exceptional; it's paradigmatic of causation generally.

### William Hasker

Hasker's "emergent dualism" combines agent causation with an emergentist picture. The soul emerges from brain complexity but is ontologically distinct from it. Unlike Cartesian dualism, the soul has natural origins; unlike materialism, it's irreducible. This supports free will through the unity of consciousness argument: only a genuinely unified agent, not a collection of subsystems, can exercise unified agency.

## The Luck Objection

The central challenge to libertarian free will is the *luck objection*. If indeterminism leaves outcomes undetermined, then nothing about the agent explains which choice occurs. The outcome is lucky or arbitrary—not the agent's doing any more than a determined outcome would be.

Alfred Mele's version: Consider two possible worlds identical up to the moment of decision. In one, the agent chooses A; in the other, B. Nothing about the agent differs between worlds. So what explains the difference? Nothing—it's just luck. But lucky choices aren't free choices.

Agent-causal libertarians respond that the agent *does* explain the difference. In one world, the agent caused A; in the other, the agent caused B. The agent's causing is the explanation. This isn't reducible to prior events (which were identical), but it's not arbitrary—it's the agent exercising causal power.

Critics find this unsatisfying. "The agent caused it" seems to push the explanatory question back rather than answer it. What about the agent explains why they caused A rather than B?

### The Site's Response

The site's framework strengthens the agent-causal response. Consciousness doesn't randomly select quantum outcomes—it genuinely *chooses* based on reasons. The selection is neither determined (physics didn't fix the outcome) nor lucky (consciousness selected based on what matters to it).

The [phenomenology of effort](/concepts/mental-effort/) supports this. Directing attention feels effortful; sustaining choice requires ongoing engagement. If choice were merely random quantum fluctuation, there would be no phenomenology of effort—no sense of the agent working to maintain focus. The felt cost of concentration reflects genuine causal engagement, not passive observation of random events.

## Substance Causation and the Site's Framework

Lowe and O'Connor's substance causation view has profound implications. If all causation is fundamentally substances exercising powers, then consciousness causing physical events isn't metaphysically exceptional—it's how causation works generally.

This reframes the [causal closure objection](/arguments/interactionist-dualism/#the-causal-closure-argument). The objection assumes event causation is fundamental: every physical event must have a prior physical event cause. But if substance causation is fundamental, this assumption fails. Physics describes regularities in what substances do; it doesn't prove substances are exclusively physical.

The site's quantum mechanism specifies *where* agent causation interfaces with physics: at quantum indeterminacies, where physics leaves outcomes undetermined. The agent—the conscious substance—selects among quantum possibilities. This isn't consciousness "adding" to physical causation; it's consciousness exercising the same kind of causal power that all substances exercise, at points where physics doesn't determine the outcome.

## Agent Causation and Sourcehood

Robert Kane emphasizes *sourcehood* as the core requirement for free will: the agent must be the ultimate source of their actions, not merely a link in causal chains originating elsewhere. This condition is satisfied if the agent is an "uncaused cause"—but event-causal libertarianism struggles to provide this.

Agent causation provides sourcehood directly. The agent is the source because the agent, as substance, initiates the causal chain. Prior events influence but don't determine; the agent determines by exercising irreducible causal power.

The site's framework satisfies both of Kane's conditions for free will:
- **Sourcehood**: Consciousness is the ultimate source because it selects which quantum outcome becomes actual
- **Alternative possibilities**: Multiple outcomes were genuinely possible until selection occurred

The retrocausal dimension (see [retrocausality](/concepts/retrocausality/)) adds depth. If consciousness's selection is atemporal—if it determines which temporal history becomes real—then the agent is even more radically the source. Not just "the first cause in this chain" but "the cause of there being this chain at all."

## Relation to Site Perspective

Agent causation is the philosophical tradition to which this site belongs. The [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet—that consciousness causally influences the physical world—is a claim of agent causation: the conscious subject, as substance, causes physical events.

What the site adds is mechanism. Traditional agent causation lacked an account of *where* or *how* the agent interfaces with the physical world. The [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) tenet provides this: at quantum indeterminacies, where physics specifies probabilities but not outcomes. The [quantum consciousness mechanisms](/concepts/quantum-consciousness/) (Stapp, Penrose-Hameroff) describe how this might work in detail.

The [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism) tenet is also essential. Agent causation requires the agent to be ontologically distinct from physical events—otherwise, "agent causation" collapses into event causation. Substance dualism provides this: consciousness is a substance that exercises causal powers, not a property of physical substances. Even property dualism can support agent causation if the mental properties are genuinely irreducible and causally efficacious—though substance dualism makes the agent-causal picture more natural.

The [Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits) tenet addresses the main objection to agent causation: that it's metaphysically extravagant, positing a primitive relation unlike anything else in nature. But if we take consciousness seriously—if the hard problem is genuine—then consciousness already requires something beyond standard physics. Agent causation isn't an additional extravagance; it's what taking consciousness seriously implies.
