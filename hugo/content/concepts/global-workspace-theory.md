Global Workspace Theory (GWT) is one of the most influential neuroscientific theories of consciousness. It explains *when* information becomes conscious—when it is broadcast globally across the brain—but not *why* this broadcast feels like anything. From this site's perspective, GWT provides a valuable description of [neural correlates](/concepts/neural-correlates-of-consciousness/) without solving the [hard problem](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/).

## The Theory

Bernard Baars introduced GWT in 1988 using a theatrical metaphor. Consciousness is like a spotlight on a stage: the brightly lit area represents what we're currently aware of, while the vast darkness holds unconscious processes. Only information in the spotlight can be "seen" by the audience—the many specialized brain systems that process information.

### The Workspace Architecture

The "global workspace" is a network of neurons with widespread connections across the brain. When information enters this workspace, it becomes available to many cognitive systems simultaneously:

- Memory systems can encode it
- Language systems can describe it
- Motor systems can act on it
- Reasoning systems can evaluate it

This is consciousness as *access*—the difference between information that's available for report and action versus information that stays confined to specialized processors.

### The Global Neuronal Workspace

Stanislas Dehaene and Jean-Pierre Changeux developed GWT into the Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW) hypothesis, identifying specific neural mechanisms. They proposed that the workspace is implemented by prefrontal and parietal neurons with long-range connections. When information achieves "ignition"—a sudden, synchronized activation pattern—it becomes conscious.

GNW distinguishes three states:

1. **Subliminal**: Information processed too weakly to reach the workspace
2. **Preconscious**: Information strong enough to reach the workspace but not currently attended
3. **Conscious**: Information that has achieved ignition and global broadcast

## The Access/Phenomenal Distinction

Here lies GWT's fundamental limitation. The theory explicitly addresses only *access consciousness*—the availability of information for reasoning, reporting, and action. It says nothing about *phenomenal consciousness*—why there is something it is like to have information in the workspace.

As the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy notes, GWT "provides an account of access consciousness but what of phenomenal consciousness?"

Ned Block has argued forcefully that these are distinct phenomena. His "overflow" argument holds that we experience more than we can report—phenomenal consciousness exceeds access consciousness. The Sperling experiment suggests we see all twelve letters in a briefly flashed display, even though we can only report four. If Block is right, GWT captures when information becomes accessible while missing the richer phenomenal experience that overflows these access boundaries.

## The COGITATE Experiment

The 2025 COGITATE study put GWT and [IIT](/concepts/integrated-information-theory/) to empirical test. Results were mixed for both theories:

**GNW predictions challenged:**
- The expected "ignition" when stimuli disappeared was not observed
- Prefrontal cortex activated for category recognition but not for specific identity or orientation

**Neither theory emerged unscathed.** This suggests caution about any premature physicalist explanation. The science of consciousness remains unsettled.

## GWT and AI Consciousness

GWT has direct implications for machine consciousness. If consciousness *is* global broadcast—the functional role of making information widely available—then AI systems implementing this architecture could be conscious. Some researchers have argued that Large Language Agents, with their ability to integrate information across many modules, might satisfy GWT's criteria.

This is precisely where the site's framework diverges most sharply. The [absent qualia objection](/arguments/functionalism/) applies: a system could implement global broadcast without phenomenal experience. A nation of people, each simulating a neuron in a workspace architecture, would implement the same functional organization as a conscious brain. Is the nation conscious?

Site's [AI consciousness skepticism](/topics/ai-consciousness/) rests on dualism, not denial that AI can implement workspace functions. The question is whether functional implementation suffices for experience.

## Relation to Site Perspective

### Alignment

GWT is compatible with [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism) if read as describing neural correlates rather than constituting consciousness. Interactionist dualism predicts that consciousness will have reliable correlates—the physical interface where mind and brain meet. GWT may describe this interface without claiming to explain phenomenal consciousness.

The site's [attention article](/concepts/attention/) notes that attention serves as the "gateway" to the workspace. This connects with Stapp's proposal that attention is where consciousness influences physics through the quantum Zeno effect. GWT provides mainstream neuroscience context for this idea.

### Tension

GWT is typically presented as a physicalist/functionalist theory. It identifies consciousness with global broadcast rather than treating broadcast as the physical correlate of a distinct mental phenomenon. This conflicts with the site's commitment to irreducibility.

More subtly, GWT frames the flow as bottom-up: sensory information competes for workspace access through neural dynamics. The [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet holds that consciousness *selects* which information achieves ignition—it doesn't merely observe the winner of neural competition. These views could be compatible if consciousness biases which information wins, but GWT proponents don't typically frame it this way.

### The Simplicity Objection

GWT proponents might argue their theory is simpler than dualism—it explains consciousness without positing irreducible properties. The [Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits) tenet responds: GWT's apparent simplicity is achieved by addressing only the "easy problems." As researchers acknowledge, "correlation cannot tell us whether the observed activity is the basis of phenomenal consciousness or of access consciousness in report."

GWT explains when and how information becomes accessible. It remains silent on why accessibility feels like anything at all.
