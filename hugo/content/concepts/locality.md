title: Locality and Mind-Matter Interaction

The locality problem asks: if consciousness influences quantum events in the brain, where exactly does this happen? This seems to require consciousness to have spatial properties, coordinating across potentially billions of sites. The objection appears strong—until we examine what [dualism](/concepts/interactionist-dualism/) actually implies about the "mind side," what physics itself reveals about non-locality, and what contested assumptions about space underlie the challenge.

The concern rests on unstated assumptions about how non-physical causation must work. Examining these assumptions significantly weakens the apparent difficulty. For the more specific question of why consciousness acts on *this* brain rather than others, and what makes brains suitable interfaces at all, see [brain-interface-boundary](/concepts/brain-interface-boundary/).

## The Objection Stated

From [consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns](/questions/consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns/):

> If consciousness influences quantum events in the brain, where exactly does this happen? The proposal requires:
> - Specific physical locations where selection occurs
> - Some mechanism for consciousness to "access" these locations
> - Coordination across potentially billions of such sites

The implicit argument: consciousness would need to be "present at" each quantum decision point, somehow knowing where to look and what to do. This seems to require spatial extension, which consciousness apparently lacks—or at least, which sits oddly with its apparent unity.

## Response 1: Locality Is Not a Universal Constraint

The locality objection assumes that any cause must be spatially located at each point where it produces effects. But this assumption is not universally enforced even in physics—and consciousness, as a non-physical posit, need not satisfy it at all.

Within physics itself, locality is contested territory. Quantum entanglement produces correlated outcomes across arbitrary distances without any local mechanism transmitting the correlation (Bell, 1964). The correlations are real, experimentally verified, and resist explanation through local hidden variables. Whatever produces them does not operate by "reaching" each measurement site from a spatial location.

The dualist can press this point: if the physical world itself contains non-local correlations that resist spatially local explanation, demanding strict locality from a non-physical cause is an inconsistent standard. The objector would need to show that *only* physical non-locality is permissible—a claim requiring justification that is rarely provided.

More fundamentally, consciousness is posited as non-physical precisely because it has properties (subjective experience, intentionality, unity) that physical description does not capture. A non-physical cause has no spatial location to begin with. Asking "where is it?" when interacting with neural sites treats consciousness as though it must be somewhere in particular—importing spatial assumptions that the dualist framework explicitly rejects.

This does not make the locality objection trivial. The question of *how* a non-spatial cause interfaces with spatially distributed physical events remains genuine and difficult. But the objection's force depends on assuming that all causation must be spatially mediated, and this assumption is both philosophically contestable and empirically strained.

## Response 2: The Mind Side Need Not Be Simple

The locality objection often assumes that the "mind" in dualism must be a simple, point-like thing—a soul that somehow lacks the resources to engage with complex spatial structure. But nothing in dualism requires this. This assumption underlies the [pairing problem](/concepts/pairing-problem/)—the challenge of explaining what connects *this* mind to *this* body—yet it's an assumption, not a logical necessity.

If physical reality has billions of interacting particles, immensely complex chemistry, and intricate spatial structure, why should the non-physical be simpler? The assumption that mind must be a featureless point reflects an impoverished imagination about what dualism permits.

Consider: if consciousness is not reducible to physics, it may have its own structure—perhaps *more* complex than physical structure, not less. The experienced richness of consciousness already hints at this. A single moment of visual experience contains more differentiated content than any physical description captures.

The [brain-interface-boundary](/concepts/brain-interface-boundary/) article develops this further: neural systems may be suitable interfaces precisely because they have the right kind of complexity—representational structure, feedback integration, quantum sensitivity—to engage with a complex mind. The mind-brain pairing isn't arbitrary; it reflects structural correspondence between the non-physical and physical domains.

The mind side of dualism could include:
- Structure sufficient to engage with distributed physical events
- Intrinsic organisation that maps onto neural patterns
- Complexity that makes "coordinating billions of sites" trivial from its perspective

We should not import materialist assumptions about simplicity into our conception of what consciousness might be.

## Response 3: The Objection Assumes a Contested Picture of Space

The locality objection presupposes that space is fundamentally real and that all causation must respect spatial constraints. Both assumptions face independent philosophical challenges.

**Space may not be fundamental.** Several approaches in contemporary physics—loop quantum gravity, certain interpretations of the holographic principle—treat spacetime as emergent from more basic non-spatial structure (Huggett & Wüthrich, 2013). If spatial relations are derived rather than fundamental, then insisting that mind-matter interaction respect spatial locality imposes a constraint that may not apply at the deeper level where causation operates.

**Causation need not be spatial.** Mathematical, logical, and modal relationships are causally relevant (laws of nature constrain what happens) without being spatially located. The dualist proposes that consciousness is another non-spatial factor that shapes physical outcomes. The burden is on the objector to show why consciousness specifically must obey spatial constraints that other non-spatial influences (abstract structure, nomological necessity) arguably do not.

This response does not dissolve the locality objection entirely—it identifies the objection's dependence on a particular metaphysical picture. If spacetime is fundamental and all causation is local, the objection has force. If either assumption fails, the objection's force diminishes proportionally. The dualist need not resolve these open questions in physics and metaphysics; it suffices to note that the locality objection is conditional on answers that remain contested.

## The Binding Problem Comparison

The [binding problem](/concepts/binding-problem/) asks how distributed neural activity produces unified experience. Critics sometimes argue that [quantum selection](/concepts/quantum-consciousness/) makes this harder—now we need to unify distributed *selections* as well as distributed activity.

But the same point applies: the mind side of dualism can have whatever structure it needs. If consciousness is unified (as it phenomenologically appears), then it may engage with distributed physical events *as* a unified process. The puzzle of how distributed physics yields unified experience is the hard problem—it exists regardless of whether quantum selection occurs.

Indeed, quantum entanglement may *help* with binding rather than hinder it. If neural quantum events are entangled, they constitute a single holistic state rather than billions of independent decisions. The quantum framework doesn't merely tolerate coordination—it provides a natural mechanism for it.

Quantum selection doesn't make binding harder; binding is already hard. The question is whether we have any reason to think quantum selection is *additionally* problematic. Given the responses above, we don't.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The Unfinishable Map's [tenets](/tenets/) commit to bidirectional interaction: consciousness causally influences physical outcomes. The locality objection is one challenge to this commitment.

The responses here don't *prove* that consciousness coordinates quantum events across the brain. They show that:

1. **The objection applies an inconsistent standard.** Physics itself contains non-local correlations (entanglement) that resist spatially local explanation. Demanding strict locality from a non-physical cause while tolerating physical non-locality is not principled.

2. **The objection assumes too little.** Dualism permits rich structure in the non-physical. A complex mind engaging with complex matter is no more puzzling than complex matter engaging with complex matter.

3. **The objection rests on contested assumptions.** Its force depends on space being fundamental and all causation being local—positions that face independent challenges in both physics and metaphysics.

The bidirectional interaction tenet survives the locality challenge. It faces other challenges ([decoherence](/concepts/decoherence/), mechanism details), but spatial coordination is not an additional barrier.
