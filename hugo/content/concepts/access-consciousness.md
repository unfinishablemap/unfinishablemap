Access consciousness (A-consciousness) is information that is "poised for global control"—available for reasoning, verbal report, and rational guidance of action. Ned Block introduced the term in 1995 to isolate the functional aspect of consciousness from [phenomenal consciousness](/concepts/phenomenal-consciousness/) (P-consciousness), the "what it's like" quality of experience. Block argues this distinction reveals what physicalist theories can explain (access mechanisms) versus what remains puzzling (phenomenal properties).

The distinction is philosophically contested. Functionalists reject it as question-begging: they hold that phenomenology just *is* certain functional properties, so defining P-consciousness as something beyond function assumes what needs to be proved. The Map accepts Block's distinction based on the conceivability of [inverted qualia](/concepts/inverted-qualia/) and [zombies](/concepts/philosophical-zombies/), which suggest phenomenology could vary independently of function. Those who find functionalism compelling will interpret the evidence differently—the distinction is a theoretical commitment, not a neutral framework.

For those who accept the distinction, it matters for [dualism](/tenets/#dualism) because it shows that acknowledging consciousness's functional role doesn't eliminate the [hard problem](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/). Blindsight may demonstrate access without phenomenology; the [overflow argument](/concepts/phenomenal-overflow/) suggests phenomenology without full access. If these dissociations are real, access consciousness is causally important but cannot be all there is to consciousness.

## Defining Access Consciousness {#definition}

Block's original formulation: "A representation is access conscious if it is poised for global control—that is, poised for free use in reasoning and for direct 'rational' control of action (including reporting in speech) and reasoning."

Key features: (1) availability to multiple cognitive systems, (2) rational control over deliberate action, (3) reportability in speech or thought, and (4) functional definition—what information *does*, not what it *feels like*.

**Examples**: A visual perception you can describe and reason about; information in [working memory](/concepts/working-memory/) available for executive processes. **Contrasts**: Subliminal stimuli affecting behavior without awareness; blindsight information patients can "guess" but can't use for normal reasoning. The boundaries are contested—these examples drive debates about dissociations (explained in [](#dissociations)).

## The Access/Phenomenal Distinction {#distinction}

Block's 1995 paper "On a Confusion about a Function of Consciousness" argued that conflating access consciousness (information available for reasoning, report, and action) with [phenomenal consciousness](/concepts/phenomenal-consciousness/) (the subjective "what it's like") has "bad results"—functions of access-machinery get "illicitly transferred" to phenomenal consciousness.

**For consciousness science**: [Global Workspace Theory](/concepts/global-workspace-theory/) explains when information becomes A-conscious (global broadcast) but not why broadcast feels like anything. The theory succeeds at access while leaving the [hard problem](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/) untouched.

**For dualism**: Acknowledging A-consciousness *strengthens* the dualist position. Physicalism can explain access-mechanisms; what remains inexplicable is why globally broadcast information feels like anything. The [explanatory gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/) persists even after we understand access.

**For AI consciousness**: Systems might be A-conscious without being P-conscious. If consciousness involves irreducible phenomenal properties, functional similarity doesn't guarantee phenomenology. See [ai-consciousness](/topics/ai-consciousness/).

## Dissociations: Access Without Phenomenology, Phenomenology Without Access {#dissociations}

Block argues A-consciousness and P-consciousness can dissociate in both directions. If they sometimes come apart, they cannot be identical.

### Blindsight: Access Without Phenomenology?

Blindsight patients have cortical damage causing a blind spot—they report seeing nothing yet can "guess" stimulus properties with above-chance accuracy. This involves *some* information reaching cognitive systems but not full global access.

**Contested interpretations**: Functionalists argue blindsight shows degraded phenomenology matching degraded access—no dissociation to explain, since "access without phenomenology" presupposes phenomenology is something beyond functional access. The Map reads blindsight as minimal or absent P-consciousness despite partial access, supporting the claim that access and phenomenology are distinct. See [philosophical-zombies](/concepts/philosophical-zombies/) for whether such dissociation is metaphysically possible. The [conscious vs unconscious processing](/concepts/conscious-vs-unconscious-processing/) literature provides complementary evidence: a 2025 meta-analysis found that only 10% of claimed unconscious processing effects survive rigorous methodology, while consciousness enables three specific functions—durable maintenance, novel combinations, and spontaneous intentional action—that unconscious processing cannot achieve.

### The Overflow Argument: Phenomenology Without Full Access

Block's [overflow argument](/concepts/phenomenal-overflow/) holds that we experience more than we can report—P-consciousness exceeds A-consciousness in capacity. Evidence from iconic memory experiments suggests subjects phenomenally experience more letters than they can subsequently access. Critics (Dennett, Cohen) argue this is confabulation of a gestalt impression. See [phenomenal-overflow](/concepts/phenomenal-overflow/) for detailed examination.

### Pure Thoughts: A-Consciousness Without P-Consciousness?

Can thoughts be A-conscious without phenomenal character? The thought "Paris is the capital of France" is A-conscious when used in reasoning—but is there phenomenology of entertaining it? This connects to [cognitive-phenomenology](/concepts/cognitive-phenomenology/)—whether thinking has experiential character distinct from sensory phenomenology.

## Access Consciousness and Functionalism {#functionalism}

[functionalism](/concepts/functionalism/) defines mental states by their causal-functional roles. Access consciousness fits naturally into functionalist frameworks—it's defined by what information *does* (availability for reasoning, report, action). This is why [Global Workspace Theory](/concepts/global-workspace-theory/) succeeds as a theory of A-consciousness.

**The functionalist challenge**: Functionalists argue the access/phenomenal distinction is question-begging. When you ask "what is it like to see red?", functionalists answer: it's having color-detection systems activated to produce discrimination, reports, and memory formation. That *is* the phenomenology—no additional "redness" beyond functional capacities. Block's distinction assumes access and phenomenology refer to different things rather than proving it.

**The Map's response**: The [inverted qualia](/concepts/inverted-qualia/) objection suggests phenomenology might vary while functional role stays constant. The [zombie argument](/concepts/philosophical-zombies/) suggests functional organization might exist without phenomenology. These thought experiments indicate phenomenology is not captured by functional description. If correct, we can grant A-consciousness is functionally explicable while maintaining P-consciousness is not—isolating precisely what remains unexplained.

## The Role of Attention {#attention}

[Attention](/concepts/attention-as-interface/) is the mechanism that *selects* what enters the global workspace; A-consciousness is the state of being in the workspace. Attended information typically becomes A-conscious; inattentional blindness shows unattended information may not reach full access.

If [overflow](/concepts/phenomenal-overflow/) is real, attention selects what becomes A-conscious from a richer phenomenal field—attention doesn't create P-consciousness but determines what reaches access-machinery. This fits the dualist view: phenomenal consciousness exists in parallel with functional access, and attention is the bridge.

**Stapp's quantum mechanism**: [Henry Stapp's model](/concepts/stapp-quantum-mind/) proposes that [attention is the interface](/concepts/attention-as-interface/) where consciousness influences physical processes through the quantum Zeno effect. Critics like Tegmark argue this requires measurements faster than decoherence timescales—a mismatch of six orders of magnitude with attention's timescale. The model remains speculative. See [motor-selection](/concepts/motor-selection/) for how selection might work in action.

## Access Consciousness and Dualist Interaction {#interaction}

If [consciousness causally influences the brain](/tenets/#bidirectional), access consciousness is plausibly part of that mechanism. P-consciousness operates *through* A-consciousness machinery: by modulating attention, consciousness determines what becomes A-conscious. The *machinery* of access (global workspace, prefrontal-parietal networks) is physical, but what *drives* selection may be phenomenal consciousness operating through quantum-level interactions. See [causal-closure](/concepts/causal-closure/) for how this avoids violating conservation laws.

**Free will connection**: Libertarian free will requires that agents genuinely select among alternatives. A-consciousness is where alternatives become explicit—available for deliberation and choice. See [free-will](/topics/free-will/) and [the phenomenology of choice](/concepts/phenomenology-of-choice/).

## Relation to Site Perspective {#tenets}

### Dualism

Access consciousness reveals what physicalism *can* explain: functional availability, information integration, global broadcast. [Global Workspace Theory](/concepts/global-workspace-theory/) succeeds at this task. What remains inexplicable is [why global broadcast feels like anything](/concepts/phenomenal-consciousness/). By isolating A-consciousness as the functional aspect, we clarify that the [hard problem](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/) concerns P-consciousness specifically.

The [explanatory gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/) persists: neural mechanisms for access don't bridge to phenomenology. Block's dissociations strengthen dualism: if access and phenomenology can come apart, they're distinct. Blindsight suggests access without phenomenology; [overflow](/concepts/phenomenal-overflow/) suggests phenomenology exceeding access. If P-consciousness isn't reducible to A-consciousness, and A-consciousness is functionally explicable, then P-consciousness requires non-physical explanation.

### Bidirectional Interaction

If consciousness influences behavior, it must work through access mechanisms. Phenomenal consciousness determines what becomes A-conscious via [attention as interface](/concepts/attention-as-interface/). The causal pathway: P-consciousness → attention → A-consciousness → action. See [mental-causation](/concepts/mental-causation/) for how non-physical phenomenal properties exert causal influence through physical attention mechanisms.

### Minimal Quantum Interaction

Access mechanisms are the "downstream" neural processes that amplify initial quantum-level interventions. Consciousness doesn't need to control the entire global workspace—only the quantum indeterminacies that determine what gets selected for broadcast. Once a pattern is selected, classical neural dynamics handle global broadcast (A-consciousness). The energy-conservation objection dissolves because no energy is injected—consciousness selects among possibilities physics leaves undetermined. See [causal-closure](/concepts/causal-closure/#stapps-quantum-response) and [conservation-laws-and-mind](/topics/conservation-laws-and-mind/).

### No Many Worlds

The [Many Worlds Interpretation](/concepts/many-worlds/) implies all possible outcomes occur across branches. If consciousness operates through quantum selection, MWI threatens to make that selection illusory. MWI defenders respond with self-locating uncertainty: "which branch am I on?" is meaningful with a definite answer given by observation.

**The dualist objection**: Self-locating uncertainty presupposes a determinate "I" whose location is uncertain—but MWI's ontology contains only wave functions evolving deterministically. The answer "you're the version in this branch" may suffice for spatial self-location, but consciousness involves the qualitative character of *this* experience. The question is not "which branch am I on?" but "why is there something it's like to be this branch-occupant?"

Access consciousness is where this becomes existentially urgent. When you choose, one option guides action, enters [episodic memory](/concepts/episodic-memory/), shapes your future self. MWI says all options become A-conscious for different versions—but the subject asking "why this one?" seeks an explanation that "all of them, to different yous" doesn't provide. See [indexical-identity-quantum-measurement](/topics/indexical-identity-quantum-measurement/) for detailed analysis.

### Occam's Razor Has Limits

[Global Workspace Theory](/concepts/global-workspace-theory/) explains A-consciousness but leaves P-consciousness unexplained. [Integrated Information Theory](/concepts/integrated-information-theory/) attempts to address P-consciousness but faces its own difficulties. The 2025 [COGITATE adversarial collaboration](/concepts/global-workspace-theory/#the-cogitate-experiment) found neither theory fully captured the phenomena.

This illustrates [the limits of Occam's Razor](/tenets/#occams-limits). Physicalist theories are simpler (one substance) but struggle with consciousness. Dualism is more complex but handles both access (functional) and phenomenology (irreducible). The A-consciousness / P-consciousness distinction shows *what* physicalism can explain (access) and *what* it cannot (phenomenology).
