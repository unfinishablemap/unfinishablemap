Access consciousness (A-consciousness) is information that is "poised for global control"—available for reasoning, verbal report, and rational guidance of action. Ned Block introduced the term in 1995 to isolate the functional aspect of consciousness from [phenomenal consciousness](/concepts/phenomenal-consciousness/) (P-consciousness), the "what it's like" quality of experience. Block argues this distinction reveals what physicalist theories can explain (access mechanisms) versus what remains puzzling (phenomenal properties).

The distinction is philosophically contested. Functionalists reject it as question-begging: they hold that phenomenology just *is* certain functional properties, so defining P-consciousness as something beyond function assumes what needs to be proved. The Map accepts Block's distinction based on the conceivability of [inverted qualia](/concepts/inverted-qualia/) and [zombies](/concepts/philosophical-zombies/), which suggest phenomenology could vary independently of function. Those who find functionalism compelling will interpret the evidence differently—the distinction is a theoretical commitment, not a neutral framework.

For those who accept the distinction, it matters for [dualism](/tenets/#dualism) because it shows that acknowledging consciousness's functional role doesn't eliminate the [hard problem](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/). Blindsight may demonstrate access without phenomenology; the [overflow argument](/concepts/phenomenal-overflow/) suggests phenomenology without full access. If these dissociations are real, access consciousness is causally important but cannot be all there is to consciousness.

## Defining Access Consciousness {#definition}

Block's original formulation: "A representation is access conscious if it is poised for global control—that is, poised for free use in reasoning and for direct 'rational' control of action (including reporting in speech) and reasoning."

Key features:

1. **Availability**: The information must be available to multiple cognitive systems, not confined to specialized processors
2. **Rational control**: It can guide deliberate action and explicit reasoning
3. **Reportability**: The subject can typically describe the content in speech or thought (though reportability is consequence, not definition)
4. **Functional role**: A-consciousness is defined by what information *does*, not what it *feels like*

### What Counts as Access Conscious

- A visual perception that you can describe and reason about
- An occurrent thought that guides your next action
- A memory you're currently retrieving for decision-making
- Information in [working memory](/concepts/working-memory/) available for executive processes

### What Might Not Be Access Conscious

- Subliminal stimuli that affect behavior without awareness
- Information in iconic memory before you attend to it
- Procedural knowledge guiding automatic actions
- Blindsight information that patients can "guess" but can't access for normal reasoning

The boundaries are contested—these examples drive debates about dissociations between access and phenomenology (explained below in [](//#dissociations)).

## The Access/Phenomenal Distinction {#distinction}

Block's 1995 paper "On a Confusion about a Function of Consciousness" argued that philosophers and scientists routinely conflate two concepts:

**Access consciousness**: Information available for reasoning, report, and action
**[Phenomenal consciousness](/concepts/phenomenal-consciousness/)**: What it's like to be in a mental state—the subjective, experiential quality

The confusion has "bad results" because functions of the access-machinery get "illicitly transferred" to phenomenal consciousness. For example, blindsight patients cannot use information about stimuli in their blind field for normal reasoning (access deficit), and we conclude phenomenal consciousness must be necessary for guiding action. But this confuses what access-mechanisms do with what phenomenal properties do.

### Why the Distinction Matters

**For consciousness science**: [Global Workspace Theory](/concepts/global-workspace-theory/) explains when information becomes A-conscious (global broadcast) but says nothing about why this broadcast feels like anything. Dehaene and Changeux's Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW) identifies neural mechanisms for access—prefrontal-parietal ignition—without addressing P-consciousness. The theory succeeds at what it attempts (access) while leaving the [hard problem](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/) untouched.

**For dualism**: Acknowledging A-consciousness *strengthens* rather than weakens the dualist position. Physicalism can plausibly explain access-mechanisms through neural architecture and information integration. What remains inexplicable is why globally broadcast information feels like anything. The [explanatory gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/) persists even after we understand access.

**For AI consciousness**: Systems might be A-conscious (information poised for reasoning, report, action control) without being P-conscious (having phenomenal experience). The [substrate critique](/concepts/substrate-independence-critique/) applies: if consciousness involves irreducible phenomenal properties, functional similarity (matching access architecture) doesn't guarantee phenomenology. See [ai-consciousness](/topics/ai-consciousness/).

## Dissociations: Access Without Phenomenology, Phenomenology Without Access {#dissociations}

Block argues A-consciousness and P-consciousness can dissociate in both directions. If they sometimes come apart, they cannot be identical.

### Blindsight: Access Without Phenomenology?

Blindsight patients have cortical damage (typically V1) causing a blind spot in their visual field. They report seeing nothing in the blind field—no phenomenology. Yet they can "guess" stimulus properties with accuracy far above chance: location, motion, even color.

**The access interpretation**: Blindsight involves *some* information reaching cognitive systems (enabling forced-choice guessing) but not full global access (not available for free use in reasoning and action). Patients can't use the information naturally; they must be prompted to guess. This is degraded access, not full A-consciousness.

**The phenomenology question**: Is there degraded phenomenology matching the degraded access? This is contested. Block argues blindsight shows that access-machinery does certain work (enabling action guidance when information is broadcast) that we can't automatically attribute to phenomenal consciousness.

**The functionalist interpretation**: If phenomenology just is functional availability, then blindsight shows degraded phenomenology matching degraded access—there's no dissociation to explain. The apparent "access without phenomenology" *presupposes* that phenomenology is something beyond the functional access that's clearly reduced.

**Dualist reading**: The Map reads blindsight as minimal or absent P-consciousness despite partial access. If this interpretation is correct, the dissociation supports the claim that access and phenomenology are distinct. However, whether blindsight actually demonstrates dissociation depends on accepting Block's framework in the first place. See [philosophical-zombies](/concepts/philosophical-zombies/) for whether access without phenomenology is metaphysically possible.

### The Overflow Argument: Phenomenology Without Full Access

Block's [overflow argument](/concepts/phenomenal-overflow/) holds that phenomenal consciousness has richer content than access consciousness—we experience more than we can report or think about. Evidence from iconic memory experiments suggests subjects phenomenally experience more letters than they can subsequently report, implying P-consciousness exceeds A-consciousness in capacity.

If overflow is real, it has significant implications: phenomenal richness exceeds what [Global Workspace](/concepts/global-workspace-theory/) mechanisms make accessible, and P-consciousness cannot reduce to A-consciousness if P has higher capacity than A.

Critics—notably Dennett and Cohen—offer a deflationary response: subjects experience a *gestalt impression* rather than specific letters, and the sense of rich phenomenology is confabulation. The debate remains genuinely contested. See [phenomenal-overflow](/concepts/phenomenal-overflow/) for detailed examination of the evidence and arguments on both sides.

### A-Consciousness Without P-Consciousness?

Can mental states be A-conscious without phenomenal character? Block thinks yes: occurrent thoughts and judgments are available for reasoning and action (A-conscious) but may lack "what it's like" quality.

**Example**: The thought "Paris is the capital of France" is A-conscious when you're using it in reasoning. But is there phenomenology of entertaining this proposition? What is it *like* to think "Paris is the capital of France"?

**Two positions**:
1. **No cognitive phenomenology**: Only sensory/emotional states have P-consciousness; thoughts are A-conscious only
2. **Cognitive phenomenology exists**: There is something it's like to understand, doubt, judge—distinct from sensory phenomenology but phenomenal nonetheless

This debate connects to [cognitive-phenomenology](/concepts/cognitive-phenomenology/)—whether thinking itself has experiential character. If pure thoughts are A-conscious without P-consciousness, the dissociation holds in this direction too.

## Access Consciousness and Functionalism {#functionalism}

[Functionalism](/arguments/functionalism/) defines mental states by their causal-functional roles: what causes them, what they cause, how they relate to other mental states. Access consciousness fits naturally into functionalist frameworks—it's defined by its functional role (availability for reasoning, report, action).

This is why [Global Workspace Theory](/concepts/global-workspace-theory/) succeeds as a theory of A-consciousness. GWT explains *when* information becomes A-conscious (upon global broadcast) and *how* this happens (ignition across prefrontal-parietal networks). These are functional explanations: describing mechanisms that make information available.

**The functionalist challenge**: Functionalists argue that the access/phenomenal distinction is question-begging. When you ask "what is it like to see red?", functionalists answer: it's like having your color-detection systems activated in ways that produce discrimination, verbal reports, and memory formation. That *is* the phenomenology—there's no additional "redness" beyond these functional capacities. Every time we try to specify the "what it's like" beyond function, we end up describing more functional properties (it guides attention, enables re-identification, has fineness of grain).

On this view, Block's distinction doesn't reveal two aspects of consciousness; it defines different concepts while assuming they refer to different things. A consistent functionalist denies any genuine dissociation between access and phenomenology—blindsight shows reduced phenomenology matching reduced function, and "overflow" confuses the ability to access with having accessed.

**The Map's response**: The [inverted qualia](/concepts/inverted-qualia/) objection suggests phenomenology might vary while functional role stays constant. The [zombie argument](/concepts/philosophical-zombies/) suggests functional organization might exist without phenomenology. These thought experiments—however contested—indicate that phenomenology is not captured by functional description. See [functionalism](/arguments/functionalism/) for the full case against functionalist accounts of P-consciousness.

**For dualism**: If the Map's position is correct, we can grant that A-consciousness is functionally explicable while maintaining that P-consciousness is not. This isolates precisely what remains unexplained. The [explanatory gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/) applies to phenomenal properties, not to access mechanisms. Those who accept functionalism will find this framework unmotivated—the debate turns on whether conceivability arguments against functionalism succeed.

## The Role of Attention {#attention}

[Attention](/concepts/attention/) is intimately connected to access consciousness, though the exact relationship is debated.

**Are attention and A-consciousness identical?** Not quite. Attention is the mechanism that *selects* what enters the global workspace; A-consciousness is the state of being in the workspace. But they're closely linked:

- Attended information typically becomes A-conscious
- Inattentional blindness shows that unattended information may not reach full access
- [Voluntary attention](/concepts/voluntary-attention/) enables deliberate control over what becomes accessible

**Block's overflow argument revisited**: If [overflow](/concepts/phenomenal-overflow/) is real, attention selects what becomes A-conscious from a richer phenomenal field. Attention doesn't create P-consciousness but determines what reaches the access-machinery. This fits the dualist view: phenomenal consciousness exists in parallel with functional access, and attention is the bridge.

**Stapp's quantum mechanism**: [Henry Stapp's model](/concepts/stapp-quantum-mind/) proposes that [attention is the interface](/concepts/attention-as-interface/) where consciousness influences physical processes. On this view, attention operates through the quantum Zeno effect: sustained observation that selects among potential outcomes. The connection to A-consciousness: attention determines what information is "held" in the global workspace long enough for reasoning and action.

This proposal faces significant objections. Critics like Max Tegmark argue the quantum Zeno effect requires measurements faster than decoherence timescales (nanoseconds or less), while attention operates at hundreds of milliseconds—a mismatch of six orders of magnitude. The phrase "rapid repeated observations" is metaphorical unless one can specify a physical mechanism operating at quantum timescales. Stapp's defenders respond that the relevant quantum effects may occur at different scales than neural-level decoherence, but the model remains speculative. See [motor-selection](/concepts/motor-selection/) for how selection might work in action.

## Access Consciousness and Dualist Interaction {#interaction}

If [consciousness causally influences the brain](/tenets/#bidirectional), it must work through some mechanism. Access consciousness is plausibly part of that mechanism.

**The interface role**: Consciousness influences action by determining what information is A-conscious—what's available to guide reasoning and behavior. This doesn't require that P-consciousness *is* A-consciousness, only that P-consciousness operates *through* A-consciousness machinery.

**Two-stage model**:
1. **Phenomenal stage**: Rich experiential field (P-consciousness) that may overflow what's currently accessed
2. **Access stage**: Attention selects what enters the global workspace (A-consciousness), making it available for reasoning, report, action

Conscious influence operates at stage 2: by modulating attention, consciousness determines what becomes A-conscious. [Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism](/concepts/stapp-quantum-mind/) provides a concrete proposal: sustained attention (rapid repeated observations) biases quantum indeterminacies in neural firing, selecting which patterns stabilize. This controls what information achieves global broadcast.

**Why this preserves dualism**: The selection process (what becomes A-conscious) cannot be fully explained by prior physical states if consciousness genuinely intervenes. The *machinery* of access (global workspace, prefrontal-parietal networks) is physical, but what *drives* the selection may be phenomenal consciousness operating through quantum-level interactions. See [causal-closure](/concepts/causal-closure/) for how this avoids violating conservation laws.

**Free will connection**: Libertarian free will requires that agents genuinely select among alternatives. A-consciousness is where these alternatives become explicit—available for deliberation and choice. [The phenomenology of choice](/concepts/phenomenology-of-choice/) includes experiencing options, deliberating, "gathering oneself" to act. This is the phenomenology of the access-machinery in operation, with consciousness determining what gets accessed and ultimately acted upon. See [free-will](/topics/free-will/) and Kane's account of self-forming actions.

## Relation to Site Perspective {#tenets}

### Dualism

Access consciousness reveals what physicalism *can* explain: functional availability, information integration, global broadcast. [Global Workspace Theory](/concepts/global-workspace-theory/) succeeds at this task. What remains inexplicable is [why global broadcast feels like anything](/concepts/phenomenal-consciousness/). By isolating A-consciousness as the functional aspect, we clarify that the [hard problem](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/) concerns P-consciousness specifically.

The [explanatory gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/) persists: neural mechanisms for access don't bridge to phenomenology. Knowing that information achieved prefrontal-parietal ignition doesn't tell us why there's "something it's like" to have that information broadcast. [Arguments against functionalism](/arguments/functionalism/) show that functional role cannot capture phenomenal properties. This persistent gap—despite decades of sophisticated neuroscientific work—may reflect a [cognitive closure](/concepts/mysterianism/) on our part, or it may indicate a genuine ontological distinction. Either possibility resists physicalist resolution.

Block's dissociations strengthen dualism: if access and phenomenology can come apart, they're distinct. Blindsight suggests access without phenomenology; [overflow](/concepts/phenomenal-overflow/) suggests phenomenology exceeding access. If P-consciousness isn't reducible to A-consciousness, and A-consciousness is functionally explicable, then P-consciousness requires non-physical explanation.

### Bidirectional Interaction

If consciousness influences behavior, it must work through access mechanisms. Phenomenal consciousness determines what becomes A-conscious via [attention as interface](/concepts/attention-as-interface/). [Stapp's model](/concepts/stapp-quantum-mind/) proposes the quantum Zeno effect: sustained attention (repeated rapid observations) biases which neural patterns stabilize, controlling what information achieves global broadcast and guides action.

A-consciousness is the *functional expression* of conscious influence. We can't directly observe phenomenal consciousness influencing neurons, but we can observe information becoming accessible for reasoning and action in ways that correlate with phenomenology. The causal pathway: P-consciousness → attention → A-consciousness → action. See [mental-causation](/concepts/mental-causation/) for how non-physical phenomenal properties exert causal influence through physical attention mechanisms.

### Minimal Quantum Interaction

Access mechanisms are the "downstream" neural processes that amplify initial quantum-level interventions. Consciousness doesn't need to control the entire global workspace—only the quantum indeterminacies that determine what gets selected for broadcast. [Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism](/concepts/stapp-quantum-mind/) proposes that attention operates at quantum collapse events in neural firing. Once a pattern is selected, classical neural dynamics handle the global broadcast (A-consciousness).

This preserves minimalism: consciousness intervenes at quantum indeterminacies, and the access-machinery amplifies that selection into macro-scale functional availability. The energy-conservation objection dissolves because no energy is injected—consciousness selects among possibilities that physics leaves undetermined. This proposal remains speculative, though it provides a coherent framework for how minimal interaction could have macro-scale effects. See [causal-closure](/concepts/causal-closure/#stapps-quantum-response) and [conservation-laws-and-mind](/topics/conservation-laws-and-mind/).

### No Many Worlds

The [Many Worlds Interpretation](/arguments/many-worlds/) of quantum mechanics implies that all possible outcomes occur across branches. If consciousness operates through quantum selection (as Stapp proposes), MWI threatens to make that selection illusory—you experience the outcome on your branch, but other versions of you experience other outcomes on other branches.

**MWI proponents respond** with self-locating uncertainty: before measurement, you don't know which branch you'll find yourself on, so subjective probability still applies. The Deutsch-Wallace decision-theoretic approach derives the Born rule from rational constraints on branching. On this view, "which branch am I on?" is a meaningful question with a definite answer given by observation.

**The MWI answer to "why this outcome?"**: MWI defenders argue that within each branch, there's a determinate fact about what that branch's occupant chose. The phenomenology of choosing is identical on both interpretations—you deliberate, you choose, one outcome becomes actual for you. The question "why do I experience this option?" has an answer: "Because you're the version in this branch." This parallels other indexical questions: "why am I this person rather than another?" isn't a deep mystery but a confused question presupposing a perspective outside all persons from which one is selected.

**The dualist objection**: Self-locating uncertainty presupposes what it needs to explain. It requires a determinate "I" whose location is uncertain. But MWI's ontology contains only wave functions evolving deterministically—no primitive fact about which branch contains *you* that grounds the uncertainty. The answer "you're the version in this branch" may suffice for spatial self-location ("why am I here rather than there?") but consciousness involves more than location—it involves the qualitative character of *this* experience. The question is not "which branch am I on?" but "why is there something it's like to be this branch-occupant?"

Access consciousness is where this becomes existentially urgent. When you deliberate between options, those options are A-conscious: represented explicitly, available for reasoning. When you choose, one option becomes A-conscious in a stronger sense: it guides action, enters [episodic memory](/concepts/episodic-memory/), shapes your future self. MWI says all options become A-conscious for different versions—but the subject asking "why this one?" seeks an explanation that "all of them, to different yous" doesn't provide, since that answer dissolves the asking subject into a branching structure.

Whether this objection succeeds depends on whether indexical identity in branching scenarios requires primitive facts the MWI wave function lacks. See [indexical-identity-quantum-measurement](/topics/indexical-identity-quantum-measurement/) for detailed analysis and [haecceity](/concepts/haecceity/) for the metaphysics of "this-ness."

### Occam's Razor Has Limits

Two leading neuroscientific theories attempt to explain consciousness in purely physical terms:

1. **[Global Workspace Theory](/concepts/global-workspace-theory/)**: Consciousness is global broadcast enabling access
2. **[Integrated Information Theory](/concepts/integrated-information-theory/)**: Consciousness is integrated information (Φ)

GWT successfully explains A-consciousness but leaves P-consciousness unexplained. IIT attempts to address P-consciousness but faces its own difficulties (panpsychism implications, implausible predictions about cerebellum). The 2025 [COGITATE adversarial collaboration](/concepts/global-workspace-theory/#the-cogitate-experiment) found that neither theory fully captured the phenomena—both made incorrect predictions.

The situation illustrates [the limits of Occam's Razor](/tenets/#occams-limits). Physicalist theories are simpler (one substance) but struggle with consciousness. Dualism is more complex (two substances) but handles both access (functional) and phenomenology (irreducible). When simpler theories persistently fail to explain the target phenomenon, simplicity stops being a reliable guide. The A-consciousness / P-consciousness distinction shows *what* physicalism can explain (access) and *what* it cannot (phenomenology), clarifying why dualism remains necessary despite being ontologically more complex.

## Illusionist Challenge

[Illusionism](/concepts/illusionism/) argues that phenomenal consciousness is an illusion—we're mistaken in thinking there's "something it's like" beyond functional access. On this view, A-consciousness is all there is; the appearance of P-consciousness as something additional is a cognitive error.

**The illusionist move**: When you think "there's what it's like to see red," that thought is A-conscious (available for report), and the seeming phenomenology is just the introspective access to your color-processing states. The "redness" is how your color-detection system represents itself to your reporting mechanisms, not a genuine phenomenal property.

**Response from dualism**: Illusionism must explain away the most obvious datum of consciousness—that experience has a qualitative character. The move requires that we be systematically deceived about our own mental states. But introspection gives us *direct* acquaintance with phenomenology; denying this is more radical than accepting dualism.

Moreover, the distinction between A-consciousness and P-consciousness itself refutes illusionism. If P-consciousness were just how A-consciousness seems to introspection, the overflow argument couldn't get off the ground—there'd be nothing to overflow. But Sperling's experiment and inattentional blindness research suggest phenomenology exceeds what's accessed. Illusionism would predict that phenomenology = what's reportable (A-conscious), but the empirical evidence challenges that equation.

See [qualia](/concepts/qualia/) for the positive case that phenomenal properties are real, and [philosophical-zombies](/concepts/philosophical-zombies/) for why conceivability arguments support this.

## Process Philosophy Perspective

Process philosophy (in the tradition of Whitehead) emphasizes becoming over being, relations over substances. From this view, access consciousness is the *relational aspect* of consciousness—how a moment of experience is *related to* subsequent cognitive processes (reasoning, action, memory).

An experience becomes A-conscious not by having an intrinsic access-property, but by entering into certain relations: it flows into working memory, it shapes motor preparation, it becomes available for verbal report. These relations are real—they constitute what Block is tracking. But they're not identical to the experiential moment itself (P-consciousness).

**Whitehead's distinction**: An occasion of experience has both *subjective immediacy* (what it's like in its happening) and *objective immortality* (how it becomes datum for subsequent occasions). P-consciousness is subjective immediacy; A-consciousness is the beginning of objective immortality—when the experience becomes available to future cognitive processes.

**Implications**: This dissolves the worry that P-consciousness would be "causally inert" if distinct from A-consciousness. The distinction isn't between phenomenology and function, but between the immediacy of experiencing and the relational availability that flows from experiencing. Both are aspects of the same concrete process. Consciousness is always both phenomenal (in its immediacy) and functional (in its consequences), though the aspects are conceptually distinct.

**Causal account**: On the process view, A-consciousness is what happens when a phenomenal occasion successfully *prehends* (grasps and incorporates) previous occasions in ways that make their content available for future occasions. Attention is the mode of prehension that selects which aspects of previous experience will be strongly incorporated (made A-conscious) versus weakly incorporated (background phenomenology without full access).
