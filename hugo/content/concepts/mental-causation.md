Mental causation is the thesis that mental states cause physical effects. When you decide to raise your arm, your decision causes the arm to rise. When pain motivates you to avoid the fire, the pain causes the avoidance. This seems obvious from experience but faces a formidable philosophical challenge: Jaegwon Kim's exclusion argument, which concludes that mental properties are either physical or causally inert. The Unfinishable Map's quantum framework provides a response: consciousness causes physical effects at points where physics is genuinely incomplete.

## The Problem

The basic puzzle: if physical events have sufficient physical causes, what room is there for mental causation?

Consider your decision to speak. Neuroscience traces the causal chain: motor cortex activation → nerve signals → muscle contraction → sound waves. Each physical event has a physical cause. Where does "your decision" enter?

If the decision is just identical to some brain state, there's no special problem—it's physical causation all the way down. But if mental properties are distinct from physical properties (as [dualism](/concepts/interactionist-dualism/) holds), they seem to be causally excluded by their physical realizers.

This is the exclusion problem: mental causes seem to compete with physical causes for the same effects.

## Kim's Exclusion Argument

Jaegwon Kim's exclusion argument is the most influential contemporary formulation. It runs:

1. **Causal closure**: Every physical event that has a cause has a sufficient physical cause
2. **Mental causation**: Mental events cause physical effects (common-sense premise)
3. **No systematic overdetermination**: Mental causes don't overdetermine effects alongside physical causes
4. **Non-reductionism**: Mental properties are not identical to physical properties

From these premises, Kim concludes that mental properties are causally excluded by their physical realizers. Either mental causation doesn't occur ([epiphenomenalism](/concepts/epiphenomenalism/)), or mental properties just *are* physical properties ([reductionism](/concepts/reductionism/)). See [reductionism](/concepts/reductionism/#kims-challenge) for the fuller argument that non-reductive views face a fundamental dilemma.

The dilemma seems stark: deny that consciousness causes anything, or deny that consciousness is anything other than physics.

## Overdetermination and Exclusion

Why can't mental and physical causes both contribute? This would be *causal overdetermination*—two independent sufficient causes converging on a single effect. Kim argues systematic overdetermination is untenable.

Critics respond: mental causes supervene on physical causes (the dependence response); mental properties may be the more *proportional* cause (Yablo); mental and physical descriptions capture the same process at different levels. Each response has merit, but none fully dissolves the problem if we accept strong [causal closure](/concepts/causal-closure/).

## The Supervenience Problem

Mental properties supervene on physical properties: no mental difference without physical difference. But supervenience creates its own problem for mental causation.

If mental property M supervenes on physical property P, and P is sufficient to cause effect E, then M seems causally "screened off." The physical realizer does all the causal work.

Kim calls this "causal drainage"—efficacy drains from higher levels to lower levels, pooling at fundamental physics. The threat extends beyond consciousness to all higher-level properties. Does temperature cause anything, or just molecular motion?

This generalization of the problem either undermines all higher-level causation (an implausible conclusion) or suggests something is wrong with the exclusion reasoning itself.

## Major Responses

### Interventionism

James Woodward's interventionist theory defines causes as factors whose manipulation would change effects. Kroedel argues this vindicates mental causation by replacing the exclusion argument's "building block" model. The challenge: can we intervene on mental properties while holding physical realizers fixed?

### Inheritance and Constitution

Mental properties might "inherit" causal powers from physical realizers through constitution or grounding—mental causation *is* physical causation under another description, without identity.

### Strong Emergence

[Strong emergentism](/concepts/emergence/) holds that mental properties have genuinely novel causal powers not present in physical constituents. O'Connor and Wong propose "structural triggering conditions"—latent powers manifesting when components organize appropriately. This requires denying causal closure, but without specifying *how* emergent causation works, it names the problem more than solves it.

### Delegatory Dualism

Bradford Saad's [delegatory dualism](/topics/delegatory-dualism/) (2025) offers a different strategy: accept that physical states could cause behaviour, but hold that experiences *preempt* this causal work rather than duplicating it.

The mechanism: physical brain states have a "default causal profile"—the pattern of effects they *would* produce absent any experience. When an experience arises whose causal profile matches this default, the experience takes over. Pain causes wincing by *preempting* what the physical state would otherwise do, not by overdetermining alongside it.

Saad's analogy: A major and a sergeant both order troops to advance. The major's order preempts the sergeant's—the troops advance because of the major's command, not because two commands overdetermined the outcome. The sergeant's order is rendered causally idle. Similarly, when you experience pain, the physical state's "cause wincing" capacity is preempted by the pain itself.

This differs crucially from overdetermination. Overdetermination posits two independent sufficient causes both contributing. Preemption has one cause *operating* while the other is *sidelined*—present but idle.

Saad's distinction between *universal* closure (every physical event has sufficient physical cause) and *[observational closure](/concepts/causal-closure/)* (no detectable violations) parallels the Map's quantum framework: both hold that mental causation can be genuine without producing empirically detectable anomalies. Delegatory dualism addresses causal *structure*; the quantum opening addresses causal *mechanism*. The frameworks complement each other.

### The Quantum Opening

The Map's response: deny causal closure at quantum indeterminacies.

Quantum mechanics specifies probabilities but not which outcome actualizes. When a radioactive atom decays, physics determines the probability but not the moment. The physical causes are genuinely insufficient. Causal closure fails.

If consciousness acts at these indeterminacies—selecting among outcomes physics leaves undetermined—it causes physical events without competing with physical causes. No overdetermination occurs because physics provides necessary but not sufficient causes. The [prebiotic collapse problem](/concepts/prebiotic-collapse/) shows this framework is cosmologically consistent: objective reduction handled collapse for 13.8 billion years before minds; consciousness modulates collapse only where neural architecture provides the interface.

This is the [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) tenet: consciousness biases quantum outcomes where the physical story runs out.

### The Decoherence Challenge

The main physics-based objection: warm neural tissue decoheres quantum superpositions in ~10^-13 seconds (Tegmark 2000), far too fast for consciousness to exploit. But this objection is more nuanced than often presented. First, recent calculations incorporating biological protective mechanisms (Fröhlich coherence, hydrophobic interiors, nuclear spin isolation) extend coherence estimates by many orders of magnitude. Second, [decoherence](/concepts/decoherence/) doesn't eliminate quantum indeterminacy—it explains why interference effects wash out, but outcomes still require determination. As a 2025 review notes: "After the basis is chosen and quantum superpositions are suppressed, the system still remains in a mixture of possible outcomes. Decoherence does not tell how and why only one of these outcomes is measured."

Consciousness could bias outcomes at the point of measurement even after decoherence has occurred. The quantum opening remains open.

### The Specification Challenge

Even granting that quantum indeterminacy provides an opening for mental causation, a further challenge remains: *which* phenomenal properties map to *which* physical selections? This specification problem is distinct from overdetermination (whether mental causes compete with physical causes) and conservation (whether mental causation violates energy conservation). Specification asks: if consciousness biases quantum outcomes, how does it do so systematically?

The [psychophysical-laws-bridging-mind-and-matter](/topics/psychophysical-laws-bridging-mind-and-matter/) provides the conceptual structure for addressing this challenge. Chalmers distinguished *supervenience laws* (which physical states produce which experiences) from what the Map calls *[selection laws](/concepts/selection-laws/)* (which mental states influence which physical outcomes). Mental causation requires selection laws—not merely supervenience laws running upward from physics to phenomenology, but laws specifying how consciousness participates in determining physical outcomes.

The [psychophysical-coupling](/concepts/psychophysical-laws/) article surveys five candidate mechanisms:

1. **Attention → observation rate** (Stapp): Sustained attention increases quantum measurement frequency, "freezing" neural patterns via the quantum Zeno effect. The most developed proposal with testable predictions.

2. **Intention → probability weighting** (Eccles): Mental intention modulates vesicle release probabilities via quantum tunneling. Moderately developed but faces the pairing problem.

3. **Valence → action selection**: Phenomenal pleasure/pain influences approach/avoidance. Evidence from pain asymbolia supports the causal role of felt badness, but no quantum mechanism proposed.

4. **Qualia → basis selection**: Qualitative character might determine which measurement basis applies. Purely speculative.

5. **Unity → sustained entanglement**: Phenomenal binding might correspond to sustained quantum coherence. Correlation found but doesn't establish causation.

Only the first two mechanisms meet basic adequacy standards—specifying which phenomenal property affects which physical parameter through what mechanism. These candidate couplings operate through different [coupling-modes](/concepts/coupling-modes/)—basis control (selecting the measurement question), timing control (selecting when collapse occurs), or probability control (reweighting outcome likelihoods)—with distinct implications for detectability. Without such specification, mental causation risks unfalsifiability.

### Why Not Many Worlds?

If all quantum outcomes occur in branching universes, there's no "selection" for consciousness to perform—every possibility actualizes somewhere. The Map's [rejection of Many-Worlds](/concepts/many-worlds/) is therefore essential to mental causation. On MWI, consciousness would be epiphenomenal with respect to quantum events: it couldn't affect which outcomes occur because all outcomes occur.

The [No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds) tenet isn't incidental to the framework—it's required for mental causation to be possible.

## Agent Causation and Mental Causation

The exclusion argument assumes event causation—events causing events according to laws. But [agent causation](/concepts/agent-causation/) offers a different model: substances (agents) causing events through exercise of causal powers.

E.J. Lowe argued that all causation is fundamentally [substance causation](/concepts/agent-causation/#the-metaphysical-foundation-substance-causation)—substances, not events, are the causal source of all change. The conscious subject causes actions not as one event producing another but as an agent exercising powers. If consciousness is a substance with genuine causal powers operating at quantum indeterminacies, the exclusion argument's framework doesn't apply.

The phenomenology of [mental effort](/concepts/mental-effort/) supports this: effort feels like *doing* something, not like observing events that happen to correlate with effort. Directing attention is experienced as agent causation, not event causation.

### Process Philosophy Alternative

Whitehead's process philosophy offers a complementary perspective. His "actual occasions"—momentary experiential events—exercise what Whitehead called "self-determination" in constituting themselves from their causal inheritance. On this view, causation is inherently experiential: each moment of experience contributes something new through creative synthesis.

This reframes mental causation as continuous with causation generally rather than metaphysically exceptional. If all causation involves experiential self-determination, human mental causation exemplifies what causation fundamentally is. The exclusion argument's assumption that causation is purely event-event regularities would be mistaken from the start.

### The Interface Question

If consciousness causes physical effects, why only in *this* brain? The [pairing problem](/concepts/pairing-problem/) asks what connects a particular mind to a particular body. The Map's response: consciousness is spatially located where it causally interfaces with the brain. [Interface-locality](/concepts/brain-interface-boundary/) constrains mental causation to neural systems already integrated into the subject's control loop—consciousness can only influence quantum systems it can "observe" through the [attention mechanism](/concepts/attention-as-interface/).

## The Self-Stultification Argument

The strongest positive argument for mental causation is the self-stultification problem. The [evolutionary case](/topics/evolutionary-case-for-mental-causation/) provides complementary support: if consciousness evolved through natural selection, it must have had causal effects on behaviour—otherwise there would be nothing for selection to act on. The [formal argument against epiphenomenalism](/arguments/epiphenomenalism/) presents this in rigorous form:

1. We discuss consciousness—we write about qualia, debate the hard problem, report our experiences
2. If epiphenomenalism is true, these discussions are not caused by consciousness itself
3. If our discussions are not caused by consciousness, our reports about consciousness are accidentally correlated with their subject matter at best
4. Beliefs formed without causal connection to their subject matter are not rationally held
5. Therefore, epiphenomenalism cannot be rationally believed on the basis of evidence about consciousness

If you can accurately report your conscious experiences—"I'm in pain," "I see red"—then your experiences must cause your reports. The pain causes the utterance about pain. Otherwise, why would the report be about the experience at all?

If mental states cause nothing, then your beliefs about consciousness aren't caused by consciousness, your reports about experiences aren't caused by experiences, and your reasoning about mental causation isn't influenced by mental evidence. This makes denying mental causation epistemically self-defeating.

The [choking phenomenon](/topics/choking-phenomenon-mental-causation/) provides complementary empirical evidence: when expert performers attend to automatized actions, performance degrades. If consciousness were epiphenomenal, it couldn't interfere with procedural execution. The interference demonstrates causation.

### The Illusionist Response

[Illusionism](/concepts/illusionism/) attempts to sidestep this argument. Frankish and Dennett argue that our reports about consciousness can be produced by sophisticated neural information processing without phenomenal causation. The brain models itself, and these self-models generate accurate reports—no phenomenal properties need cause anything.

But illusionism faces its own version of self-stultification. If the appearance of phenomenal consciousness is itself an illusion, something must be experiencing that illusion. To be under an illusion that consciousness exists requires there to be *something it is like* to have that mistaken representation. The illusion of phenomenal properties presupposes phenomenal properties—or at least something playing their functional role.

Raymond Tallis puts it sharply: "Misrepresentation presupposes presentation." All illusions presuppose experience. If physical matter cannot generate phenomenal consciousness, it certainly cannot generate the *illusion* of phenomenal consciousness. The illusionist trades the hard problem for an equally hard "illusion problem."

## Relation to the Map's Perspective

Mental causation is central to the Map's framework.

**Bidirectional Interaction**: the Map's [Bidirectional Interaction tenet](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) explicitly affirms that consciousness causally influences physical outcomes. Mental causation isn't a philosophical curiosity but a foundational commitment. The [bidirectional-interaction](/concepts/bidirectional-interaction/) concept page develops this in detail, presenting the self-stultification argument against epiphenomenalism and explaining how the quantum interface mechanism enables consciousness to select among outcomes physics leaves undetermined.

**The Quantum Resolution**: The [Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) provides the mechanism. Consciousness acts where physics is incomplete—at quantum indeterminacies. This respects the spirit of causal closure (physics explains what physics determines) while denying its letter (physics doesn't determine everything).

**Strong Emergence**: the Map's position can be understood as strong [emergentism](/concepts/emergence/) with a mechanism. Classical emergentists affirmed mental causation but couldn't explain it. The quantum framework specifies *where* and *how*: at indeterminacies, through biasing probabilities.

**Against Epiphenomenalism**: The [self-stultification argument](/concepts/epiphenomenalism/) shows mental causation must occur. If consciousness causes nothing, we can't rationally believe anything about consciousness—including epiphenomenalism. The Map takes this seriously: mental causation isn't optional.

**Agent Causation**: The [agent-causal framework](/concepts/agent-causation/) provides the metaphysics. Mental causation isn't event→event but agent→event. The conscious subject exercises causal powers at quantum openings. This addresses Kim's exclusion argument by rejecting its event-causal assumptions.

## Why This Matters

Mental causation bears directly on [free will](/topics/free-will/) (consciousness must cause choices for agency to be real), moral responsibility (blame and praise assume conscious states cause actions), and rationality (beliefs about consciousness must be caused by consciousness to be knowledge). The Map affirms mental causation because denying it undermines everything we think we know about ourselves.

## What Would Challenge This View?

Mental causation, as defended here, is falsifiable. Findings that would undermine the framework:

**Complete neural determinism**: If all neural events could be predicted from prior physical states with 100% accuracy, leaving no quantum gap for consciousness to fill, the Map's mechanism would fail. Current predictive accuracy (~60% for simple choices) leaves substantial room, but dramatic advances in neural prediction would challenge the view.

**Elimination of neural quantum effects**: If quantum coherence were proven physically impossible in brain tissue—not just challenging but excluded by physics—the proposed interface mechanism fails. Current evidence from [quantum biology](/concepts/quantum-biology/) (avian magnetoreception, enzyme catalysis, photosynthesis) suggests biological quantum effects are more robust than expected, but definitive evidence against neural quantum effects would be significant.

**Successful illusionist explanation**: If a fully satisfying account emerged explaining why we *seem* to have phenomenal experiences without any phenomenal properties existing—one that doesn't invoke seeming to something—this would dissolve the motivation for mental causation. Current illusionist proposals (AST, multiple drafts) face the regress problem, but a proposal that genuinely avoided it would challenge the Map's position.

**Dissociation of reports from experiences**: If manipulation could reliably make people report experiences they genuinely weren't having—accurate reports without corresponding experiences, or experiences without any reportability—this would challenge the causal connection the self-stultification argument depends on. Current evidence from blindsight and inattentional blindness show dissociations, but these are better interpreted as access consciousness/phenomenal consciousness distinctions than as breaks in the causal chain.

**Confirmation of Many-Worlds**: If the [many-worlds interpretation](/concepts/many-worlds/) were empirically confirmed (though how this could occur is unclear), there would be no collapse for consciousness to influence—all outcomes occur in branching universes. This would eliminate the quantum opening entirely.
