Mental causation is the thesis that mental states cause physical effects. When you decide to raise your arm, your decision causes the arm to rise. When pain motivates you to avoid the fire, the pain causes the avoidance. This seems obvious from experience but faces a formidable philosophical challenge: Jaegwon Kim's exclusion argument, which concludes that mental properties are either physical or causally inert. This site's quantum framework provides a response: consciousness causes physical effects at points where physics is genuinely incomplete.

## The Problem

The basic puzzle: if physical events have sufficient physical causes, what room is there for mental causation?

Consider your decision to speak. Neuroscience traces the causal chain: motor cortex activation → nerve signals → muscle contraction → sound waves. Each physical event has a physical cause. Where does "your decision" enter?

If the decision is just identical to some brain state, there's no special problem—it's physical causation all the way down. But if mental properties are distinct from physical properties (as [dualism](/arguments/interactionist-dualism/) holds), they seem to be causally excluded by their physical realizers.

This is the exclusion problem: mental causes seem to compete with physical causes for the same effects.

## Kim's Exclusion Argument

Jaegwon Kim's exclusion argument is the most influential contemporary formulation. It runs:

1. **Causal closure**: Every physical event that has a cause has a sufficient physical cause
2. **Mental causation**: Mental events cause physical effects (common-sense premise)
3. **No systematic overdetermination**: Mental causes don't overdetermine effects alongside physical causes
4. **Non-reductionism**: Mental properties are not identical to physical properties

From these premises, Kim concludes that mental properties are causally excluded by their physical realizers. Either mental causation doesn't occur ([epiphenomenalism](/concepts/epiphenomenalism/)), or mental properties just *are* physical properties (reductionism).

The dilemma seems stark: deny that consciousness causes anything, or deny that consciousness is anything other than physics.

## Overdetermination and Exclusion

Why can't mental and physical causes both contribute? This would be *causal overdetermination*—two independent causal processes converging on a single effect.

Kim argues systematic overdetermination is untenable. If *every* action has both mental and physical sufficient causes, this is too much coincidence. Two firing squads both killing the prisoner is conceivable; two firing squads killing *every* prisoner *every* time strains credibility.

Critics respond in several ways:

**The dependence response**: Mental and physical causes aren't independent—mental properties depend on (supervene on) physical properties. This isn't coincidental overdetermination but interdependent causation.

**The proportionality response**: Stephen Yablo argues mental and physical properties relate as determinables to determinates (as "red" relates to "scarlet"). The mental property may be the more proportional cause—neither too specific nor too general for the effect. Killing the scarlet shirt would kill the red shirt; blaming "scarlet" is over-specific.

**The levels response**: Mental and physical descriptions capture the same causal process at different levels of abstraction. It's not two causes but one cause under two descriptions.

Each response has merit, but none fully dissolves the problem if we accept strong [causal closure](/concepts/causal-closure/).

## The Supervenience Problem

Mental properties supervene on physical properties: no mental difference without physical difference. But supervenience creates its own problem for mental causation.

If mental property M supervenes on physical property P, and P is sufficient to cause effect E, then M seems causally "screened off." The physical realizer does all the causal work.

Kim calls this "causal drainage"—efficacy drains from higher levels to lower levels, pooling at fundamental physics. The threat extends beyond consciousness to all higher-level properties. Does temperature cause anything, or just molecular motion?

This generalization of the problem either undermines all higher-level causation (an implausible conclusion) or suggests something is wrong with the exclusion reasoning itself.

## Major Responses

### Interventionism

James Woodward's interventionist theory defines causes as factors whose manipulation would change effects. Mental properties can be genuine causes if intervening on them (while holding physical realizers fixed) would produce different outcomes.

Thomas Kroedel argues interventionism vindicates mental causation. The exclusion argument assumes a "building block" model of causation that interventionism replaces.

Critique: Can we even intervene on mental properties while holding physical realizers fixed, given supervenience?

### Inheritance and Constitution

Mental properties might "inherit" causal powers from physical realizers through intimate relations—constitution, grounding, or implementation. The relation is cooperative rather than competitive.

On this view, mental and physical causes aren't rivals for the same causal role. Mental causation *just is* physical causation under another description, without identity.

### Strong Emergence

[Strong emergentism](/concepts/emergence/) holds that mental properties have genuinely novel causal powers not present in physical constituents. Timothy O'Connor and Hong Yu Wong propose "structural triggering conditions"—latent powers that manifest when components organize appropriately.

This requires denying causal closure: the physical story is insufficient because organization adds something new. The challenge: without specifying *how* emergent causation works, this names the problem more than solves it.

### The Quantum Opening

This site's response: deny causal closure at quantum indeterminacies.

Quantum mechanics specifies probabilities but not which outcome actualizes. When a radioactive atom decays, physics determines the probability but not the moment. The physical causes are genuinely insufficient. Causal closure fails.

If consciousness acts at these indeterminacies—selecting among outcomes physics leaves undetermined—it causes physical events without competing with physical causes. No overdetermination occurs because physics provides necessary but not sufficient causes.

This is the [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) tenet: consciousness biases quantum outcomes where the physical story runs out.

## Agent Causation and Mental Causation

The exclusion argument assumes event causation—events causing events according to laws. But [agent causation](/concepts/agent-causation/) offers a different model: substances (agents) causing events through exercise of causal powers.

E.J. Lowe argued that all causation is fundamentally substance causation. The conscious subject causes actions not as one event producing another but as an agent exercising powers. If consciousness is a substance with genuine causal powers operating at quantum indeterminacies, the exclusion argument's framework doesn't apply.

The phenomenology of [mental effort](/concepts/mental-effort/) supports this: effort feels like *doing* something, not like observing events that happen to correlate with effort. Directing attention is experienced as agent causation, not event causation.

## The Self-Stultification Argument

The strongest positive argument for mental causation is the [self-stultification problem](/concepts/epiphenomenalism/).

If you can accurately report your conscious experiences—"I'm in pain," "I see red"—then your experiences must cause your reports. The pain causes the utterance about pain. Otherwise, why would the report be about the experience at all?

If mental states cause nothing, then:
- Your beliefs about consciousness aren't caused by consciousness
- Your reports about experiences aren't caused by experiences
- Your reasoning about mental causation isn't influenced by mental evidence

This makes denying mental causation epistemically self-defeating. Any argument against mental causation must reach your beliefs through causally inert consciousness—which means it doesn't reach them at all.

## Relation to This Site's Perspective

Mental causation is central to this site's framework.

**Bidirectional Interaction**: The site's [Bidirectional Interaction tenet](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) explicitly affirms that consciousness causally influences physical outcomes. Mental causation isn't a philosophical curiosity but a foundational commitment.

**The Quantum Resolution**: The [Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) provides the mechanism. Consciousness acts where physics is incomplete—at quantum indeterminacies. This respects the spirit of causal closure (physics explains what physics determines) while denying its letter (physics doesn't determine everything).

**Strong Emergence**: The site's position can be understood as strong [emergentism](/concepts/emergence/) with a mechanism. Classical emergentists affirmed mental causation but couldn't explain it. The quantum framework specifies *where* and *how*: at indeterminacies, through biasing probabilities.

**Against Epiphenomenalism**: The [self-stultification argument](/concepts/epiphenomenalism/) shows mental causation must occur. If consciousness causes nothing, we can't rationally believe anything about consciousness—including epiphenomenalism. The site takes this seriously: mental causation isn't optional.

**Agent Causation**: The [agent-causal framework](/concepts/agent-causation/) provides the metaphysics. Mental causation isn't event→event but agent→event. The conscious subject exercises causal powers at quantum openings. This addresses Kim's exclusion argument by rejecting its event-causal assumptions.

## Why This Matters

Mental causation bears directly on:

**Free will**: If consciousness causes nothing, [free will](/topics/free-will/) is illusory—your "choices" are physical events that happen to correlate with conscious decision-making. Mental causation is necessary for genuine agency.

**Moral responsibility**: Blame and praise assume that conscious states cause actions. If pain doesn't cause avoidance and compassion doesn't cause helping, the foundations of ethics crumble.

**Rationality**: If reasoning about consciousness isn't caused by consciousness, our beliefs about consciousness float free of evidence. Self-knowledge becomes impossible.

The site affirms mental causation because denying it undermines everything we think we know about ourselves.
