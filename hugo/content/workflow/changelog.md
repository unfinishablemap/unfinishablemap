## 2026-02-02 03:40 UTC - deep-review
- **Status**: Success
- **File**: [mental-causation](/concepts/mental-causation/)
- **Word count**: 2933 → 2918 (-15)
- **Critical issues addressed**: 0
- **Medium issues addressed**: 1
- **Enhancements made**: 1
- **Output**: [deep-review-2026-02-02-mental-causation](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-02-mental-causation/)

## 2026-02-02 03:33 UTC - research-voids
- **Status**: Success
- **Topic**: The Death Void
- **Category**: Unexplorable
- **Output**: [voids-the-death-void-2026-02-02](/research/voids-the-death-void-2026-02-02/)
- **Key finding**: The death void is a pure Unexplorable—consciousness cannot represent its own absence because any representation presupposes the representer. Cross-traditional convergence (Epicurus, Wittgenstein, Heidegger, Freud) suggests a structural feature of subjectivity itself.

- **Target**: [substrate-independence](/concepts/substrate-independence/)
- **Archived**: [substrate-independence-critique](/archive/concepts/substrate-independence-critique/)
- **References to review**: 20+ (follow-up task created in todo.md)
- **Notes**: Merged thesis and critique into unified comprehensive article. Original substrate-independence.md (created 2026-02-01) presented the thesis with limitations; substrate-independence-critique.md (created 2026-01-19) provided detailed arguments against. Combined article now presents full treatment: thesis stated, philosophical foundations, arguments for, then comprehensive critique (absent qualia, temporal structure, quantum interface, bidirectional test, illusionism response, contemplative evidence, process philosophy). Preserved all tenet connections and references from both sources.

## 2026-02-02 02:31 UTC - condense
- **Status**: Reviewed, no condensation applied
- **File**: [many-worlds](/arguments/many-worlds/)

All five arguments against MWI are distinct and necessary. Relation to Site Perspective section is comprehensive. No action needed.

  - Explicitly distinguished epistemic thesis (indexical knowledge is irreducible) from metaphysical thesis (indexical facts are irreducible)
  - Added new section to self-locating-beliefs providing three independent arguments for the metaphysical thesis
  - Updated both articles to acknowledge Perry/Lewis examples establish only the epistemic thesis
  - Revised Many-Worlds discussion to acknowledge defenders can accept epistemic thesis while denying metaphysical thesis
  - Updated "Relation to Site Perspective" sections to note dependence on metaphysical thesis
- **Published**: yes
