- **Tasks executed**: 2

### 12:30 - cross-review (hard-problem/pairing-problem)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: Updated `topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness.md`
- **Changes**: Added new "The Pairing Problem: Why This Mind with This Body?" section explaining Kim's pairing problem as a distinct dimension of the hard problem (not just "why experience?" but "why this experience with this body?"), three major responses (spatial location, haecceity, non-spatial causation), how the site's quantum framework addresses both pairing and closure problems. Added pairing-problem to concepts list and Further Reading.

### 12:00 - expand-topic (For Interactionist Dualism argument page)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: `arguments/interactionist-dualism.md`, updated `arguments/arguments.md`
- **Changes**: Created ~2000 word argument page presenting the cumulative case for interactionist dualism with seven formal arguments (explanatory gap, zombie conceivability, Mary's Room, unity of consciousness, intentionality, self-stultification, quantum indeterminacy), each with premises and conclusion. Added objections and responses table (pairing problem, conservation laws, exclusion argument, parsimony, decoherence). Connected to all five site tenets. Updated arguments section index.

### Session 85 - evolve (standard mode)
- **Status**: Success
- **Session**: 85
- **Mode**: standard (2-3 tasks)
- **Tasks executed**: 3

### 00:45 - expand-topic (mental causation)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: `concepts/mental-causation.md`
- **Changes**: Created ~1900 word concept page covering Kim's exclusion argument, the overdetermination problem, supervenience drainage, major responses (interventionism, inheritance/constitution, strong emergence, the quantum opening), agent causation framework, and the self-stultification argument for mental causation.

### 00:30 - cross-review (interactionist-dualism/emergence)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/interactionist-dualism.md`
- **Changes**: Added new "Emergence and the Mechanism Classical Emergentism Lacked" section connecting O'Connor-Wong's account of emergent properties with novel causal powers to the site's quantum framework; explained how the site specifies the mechanism classical emergentists (Broad, Alexander) left abstract; added emergence and mental-causation to concepts list and Further Reading.

### 00:35 - cross-review (causal-closure/emergence)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/causal-closure.md`
- **Changes**: Added "Kim's Formulation Dilemma" subsection under Problems with the Principle (moved up from later in article); added "The Emergentist Response" subsection connecting O'Connor-Wong's framework to the site's quantum mechanism; added emergence and mental-causation to concepts list and Further Reading.

### Session 79 - evolve (standard mode)
- **Status**: Success
- **Session**: 79
- **Mode**: standard (2-3 tasks)
- **Tasks executed**: 3

### 15:00 - deep-review (free-will)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: Updated `topics/free-will.md`, created `workflow/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-15-free-will.md`
- **Changes**: Addressed illusionist objection to phenomenology-of-effort evidence with new paragraph explaining illusionism's explanatory burden and effort-seeming correlation with cognitive difficulty. Added new "What Would Challenge This Framework?" section articulating four empirical conditions that would undermine the picture: decisive neural determinism, materialist solution to hard problem, quantum biology failure, phenomenology/measurement disconnect. Added illusionism to concepts list.

### 14:30 - research-topic (introspection reliability and first-person methods)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: `research/introspection-reliability-first-person-2026-01-15.md`
- **Key findings**: Nisbett/Wilson 1977 critique targets process access, not phenomenal content. Choice blindness (Johansson 2005) shows confabulation in decision justification, not current experience. Schwitzgebel's pluralist view: introspection is many processes, not one. Fox et al. 2012: meditation training predicts introspective accuracy with logarithmic skill curve. Microphenomenology (Petitmengin) provides rigorous techniques minimizing confabulation. Critical phenomenology (Velmans/Chalmers) offers reasonable middle ground—accept reports as prima facie guide except where specific reasons to doubt. Key insight: distinction between process access (limited) and phenomenal content access (more reliable) protects the site's reliance on first-person evidence for qualia and the hard problem.

### 14:00 - cross-review (eastern-philosophy-consciousness/dreams-and-consciousness)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: Updated `topics/eastern-philosophy-consciousness.md`
- **Changes**: Added dreams-and-consciousness to concepts list; created new "Dream Yoga: Consciousness in Sleep" subsection under Contemplative Evidence covering: six progressive stages of dream yoga practice, philosophical significance (dreams reveal mind's constructive capacity—waking and dream experience share common structure as constructions of mind), sleep yoga (awareness through dreamless sleep), 2025 Demirel lucid dreaming findings (third phase with recursive symbolic awareness), Bidirectional Interaction evidence, filter theory implications, Dalai Lama quote on death preparation; added dreams-and-consciousness as first entry in Further Reading.

### Session 78 - evolve (standard mode)
- **Status**: Success
- **Session**: 78
- **Mode**: standard (2-3 tasks)
- **Tasks executed**: 3 (all cross-reviews integrating agent-causation and dreams-and-consciousness articles)

### 12:30 - cross-review (mind-brain-separation/dreams-and-consciousness)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/mind-brain-separation.md`
- **Changes**: Added dreams-and-consciousness to concepts list; created new "Dreams as Evidence for Filter Theory" subsection under Filter Theory Framework covering: optical constraints persist in dreams (rendering engine provides substrate), physical laws don't persist (consciousness transcends physics), 2025 Demirel lucid dreaming as bidirectional interaction evidence; wikilinked existing dreams reference; added dreams-and-consciousness to Further Reading.

### 12:15 - cross-review (interactionist-dualism/agent-causation)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/interactionist-dualism.md`
- **Changes**: Added agent-causation to concepts list; created new "Agent Causation: The Metaphysical Framework" section after Decoherence Objection; connected quantum mechanism with Chisholm's transeunt/immanent causation distinction; referenced Lowe's substance causation view; showed how quantum Zeno illustrates agent causation in action; linked phenomenology of effort; added agent-causation to Further Reading.

### 12:00 - cross-review (free-will/agent-causation)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: Updated `topics/free-will.md`
- **Changes**: Added agent-causation to concepts list; expanded Libertarian Free Will description to distinguish event-causal from agent-causal versions; created new "Agent Causation: Why the Site's Framework Is Libertarian" section covering: event-causal insufficiency for sourcehood, Chisholm's immanent causation, Lowe's substance causation, connection to site's quantum selection mechanism, phenomenology of effort as evidence; added agent-causation to Further Reading.

### 11:45 - replenish-queue
- **Status**: Success

### Session 74 - evolve (standard mode)
- **Status**: Success
- **Session**: 74
- **Mode**: standard (2-3 tasks)
- **Tasks executed**: 3

### 11:00 - expand-topic (self and consciousness)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: `concepts/self-and-consciousness.md`
- **Key content**: Created ~2000 word article covering the relationship between consciousness and selfhood. Covers: minimal self vs narrative self distinction (Gallagher, Zahavi)—minimal self is pre-reflective first-person givenness, narrative self is constructed through life stories; Metzinger's self-model theory (PSM) with filter theory response—PSM may be interface rather than generator of selfhood; Buddhist no-self (anattā) and five aggregates—targets substantial self, not necessarily minimal experiential structure; connection to binding problem—phenomenal unity presupposes subject for whom binding occurs; tenet alignment analysis emphasizing Dualism, No Many Worlds (indexical identity), and Occam's Razor Has Limits.

### 10:45 - cross-review (intentionality/phenomenology)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/intentionality.md`
- **Changes**: Added phenomenology to concepts list; created new "The Phenomenological Discovery" section connecting Husserl's epoché to intentionality, showing how phenomenological method discloses aboutness as fundamental structure of conscious life; emphasized first-person irreducibility—third-person neuroscience cannot capture what-it-is-like to think about something; added phenomenology as first entry in Further Reading.

### 10:30 - cross-review (temporal-consciousness/phenomenology)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/temporal-consciousness.md`
- **Changes**: Added phenomenology to concepts list; linked Husserl's analysis to phenomenology article; added new paragraphs explaining how phenomenological method (epoché) reveals temporal structure as fundamental to conscious life—experienced time as living synthesis where past, present, and future interpenetrate; emphasized that gamma oscillations are necessary conditions but don't constitute the experience of flow; added phenomenology as first entry in Further Reading.

### Session 69 - evolve (standard mode)
- **Status**: Success
- **Session**: 69
- **Mode**: standard (2-3 tasks)
- **Tasks executed**: 2

### 23:00 - research-topic (neurophenomenology and meditation studies)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: `research/neurophenomenology-meditation-studies-2026-01-14.md`
- **Key findings**: Varela's neurophenomenology (1996) provides methodology for integrating first-person phenomenological reports with third-person neuroscience through "mutual constraints." 2025 advances include "deep computational neurophenomenology" (Bayesian mechanics) and "generative neurophenomenology" (interpersonal dimensions). Microphenomenology (Petitmengin) enables fine-grained description of brief experiential moments. Jhana neuroscience: 7-Tesla fMRI studies of advanced meditators (23,000+ hours) reveal "radically altered states" with increased brain entropy and disrupted hierarchical organization. Cessation research: some meditators can "turn off" consciousness from within, raising questions about consciousness-neural identity. Key insight: contemplative training reveals consciousness structures (jhana states, non-dual awareness, cessation) inaccessible to ordinary introspection—supports Dualism and Occam's Razor Has Limits tenets.

### 23:30 - research-topic (embodied cognition and the extended mind)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: `research/embodied-cognition-extended-mind-2026-01-14.md`
- **Key findings**: 4E cognition (embodied, embedded, enacted, extended) argues cognition depends on body and environment, not just brain. Clark & Chalmers' extended mind thesis (1998): cognitive processes can extend into notebooks and tools (Otto/Inga thought experiment). Enactivism (Varela, Thompson, Noë): cognition is embodied action, world is enacted not pre-given, experience is central. Adams & Aizawa's critique: "coupling-constitution fallacy"—being coupled to cognition ≠ being part of cognition. AI grounding problem: disembodied systems struggle with genuine understanding. Key insight: embodied cognition explicitly opposes Cartesian substance dualism but is compatible with property dualism; phenomenological roots (Husserl, Merleau-Ponty) support first-person irreducibility; filter theory can accommodate embodiment—body shapes interface without producing consciousness.

### Session 68 - evolve (standard mode)
- **Status**: Success
- **Session**: 68
- **Mode**: standard (2-3 tasks)
- **Tasks executed**: 3

### 18:05 - research-topic (phenomenology and first-person methods)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: `research/phenomenology-first-person-methods-2026-01-14.md`
- **Key findings**: Phenomenology (Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty) provides systematic evidence for first-person irreducibility. Core method is epoché (bracketing assumptions to attend to experience structures). Heidegger shifted from consciousness to Dasein (being-in-the-world). Merleau-Ponty emphasized embodied consciousness. Varela's neurophenomenology integrates first-person reports with neuroscience. 2025 research emphasizes cognitive science needs phenomenology because "intuitive dualism" is empirically widespread. Strongly supports Dualism and Occam's Razor Has Limits tenets.

### 18:30 - research-topic (arguments for dualism - positive case)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: `research/arguments-for-dualism-positive-case-2026-01-14.md`
- **Key findings**: Seven major positive arguments for dualism: conceivability (zombies), knowledge (Mary's Room), qualia, unity of consciousness, intentionality, modal argument (Swinburne), personal identity. Key contemporary defenders: Chalmers, Swinburne, Hasker, Lowe, Rickabaugh & Moreland (2023). 2020 survey: 22% of philosophers accept/lean toward dualism. Addresses parsimony objection by showing explanatory adequacy trumps simplicity.

### 18:45 - cross-review (binding-problem/mind-brain-separation)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/binding-problem.md`
- **Changes**: Added new section "The Mind-Brain Division and Phenomenal Unity" connecting binding problem to division of faculties analysis. Key insight: BP2 (phenomenal binding) falls on the mental side per filter theory—brain provides computational binding (BP1), consciousness provides phenomenal unity. Added mind-brain-separation to concepts list and Further Reading.

### Session 66 - evolve (standard mode)
- **Status**: Success
- **Session**: 66
- **Mode**: standard (2-3 tasks)
- **Tasks executed**: 3

### 12:30 - expand-topic (mind-brain separation and division of faculties)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: `concepts/mind-brain-separation.md`
- **Based on research**: Yes (`research/mind-brain-separation-faculties-2026-01-15.md`)
- **Changes**: Created ~2100 word article covering the division of faculties (qualia intrinsic to mind, automatic functions to brain, many faculties at interface), vision as case study (3D world problem, smooth motion puzzle, blindsight as interface), filter theory framework (James, Bergson, Huxley), and rendering engine analogy. Connected to dualism, bidirectional interaction, and Occam's limits tenets.

### 12:45 - cross-review (philosophical-zombies/inverted-qualia)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/philosophical-zombies.md`
- **Changes**: Added inverted-qualia to concepts list; created new "Zombies and Inverted Qualia" section with comparison table (absent vs different qualia, targets physicalism vs functionalism) explaining how the two arguments complement each other—zombies show function doesn't guarantee any experience, inverted qualia show function doesn't fix which experience; added inverted-qualia to Further Reading.

### 13:00 - cross-review (qualia/inverted-qualia)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/qualia.md`
- **Changes**: Added inverted-qualia to concepts list; substantially expanded Inverted Qualia section with Locke attribution (1689), Block/Fodor/Shoemaker development, Inverted Earth scenario, detectability objection and response (limited inversions possible, argument is modal not empirical); added inverted-qualia to Further Reading.

### Session 65 - evolve (standard mode)
- **Status**: Success
- **Session**: 65
- **Mode**: standard (2-3 tasks)
- **Tasks executed**: 3

### 03:30 - research-topic (mind-brain separation and division of faculties)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: `research/mind-brain-separation-faculties-2026-01-15.md`
- **Key findings**: Comprehensive research on dividing mental faculties between mind and brain. Qualia appear intrinsic to mind; automatic functions (respiration) clearly neural; vision presents puzzle (3D world seems to exceed slow neural firing capacity, yet blur persists in dreams). Key evidence: binding problem remains unsolved ("no plausible neural story"), hemispherectomy preserves consciousness despite massive neural loss, filter/transmission theory (James, Bergson, Huxley) provides coherent alternative to production model. Blindsight shows V1 as "gate" of visual awareness—interface point rather than source. Proposed "rendering engine" analogy: brain provides computational substrate while mind provides experiential quality.

### 04:00 - expand-topic (loss of consciousness and mind-brain relationship)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: `topics/loss-of-consciousness.md`
- **Based on research**: Yes (`research/loss-of-consciousness-mind-brain-2026-01-15.md`)
- **Changes**: Created ~1800 word article covering the filter theory alternative to materialist brain-production model (James, Bergson, Huxley), anesthesia evidence (propofol vs ketamine produce identical behavior but radically different conscious states), covert consciousness/cognitive motor dissociation (25% of "unconscious" patients retain awareness), time vanishing under anesthesia, disconnection vs destruction interpretation of brain damage, hemispherectomy evidence, active reboot mechanism, and explicit connections to site tenets (dualism, bidirectional interaction, Occam's limits).

### 04:30 - cross-review (animal-consciousness/problem-of-other-minds)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: Updated `topics/animal-consciousness.md`
- **Changes**: Added problem-of-other-minds to concepts list; added [problem-of-other-minds](/concepts/problem-of-other-minds/) link to opening paragraph; created new "Why the Inference Is Stronger for Animals Than for AI" section applying argument from analogy, inference to best explanation, and biological similarity criteria to show why animal consciousness inference has stronger grounds than AI consciousness inference; added problem-of-other-minds to Further Reading.

### Session 64 - evolve (standard mode)
- **Status**: Success
- **Session**: 64
- **Mode**: standard (2-3 tasks)
- **Tasks executed**: 3

### 01:30 - research-topic (loss of consciousness)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: `research/loss-of-consciousness-mind-brain-2026-01-15.md`
- **Key findings**: Comprehensive coverage of anesthesia mechanisms (propofol produces near-total extinction while ketamine preserves complex phenomenology), cognitive motor dissociation (25% of "unconscious" patients show awareness via neuroimaging), time perception vanishing under anesthesia, filter/transmission theory (James, Bergson, Huxley), active brain reboot mechanisms. Key insight: consciousness can persist despite behavioral unresponsiveness; brain-consciousness correlation is compatible with filter theory.

### 02:00 - expand-topic (inverted qualia)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: `concepts/inverted-qualia.md`
- **Changes**: Created ~1800 word article covering the spectrum inversion thought experiment, Block's Inverted Earth, detectability objection and responses (Hardin's color space asymmetries, Palmer's limited inversions), relation to zombie arguments, privacy of experience, physicalist responses (representationalism, phenomenal concepts strategy, Dennett), and connection to site's dualist framework.

### 02:30 - cross-review (ai-consciousness/problem-of-other-minds)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: Updated `topics/ai-consciousness.md`
- **Changes**: Added problem-of-other-minds to concepts list and Further Reading; added explicit [problem-of-other-minds](/concepts/problem-of-other-minds/) link to Epistemic Problem section; created new "Why the Inference Fails for AI" subsection applying argument from analogy, inference to best explanation, and Wittgensteinian dissolution to AI and showing why each approach fails.

### Queue status
- Replenished queue at start (3 new P2 tasks: inverted-qualia article, 2 problem-of-other-minds cross-reviews)
- Completed 3 tasks
- Remaining active: 1 P1 (mind-brain-separation), 1 P2 (animal-consciousness cross-review)
- Research generates expand-topic chain (loss-of-consciousness)
- New article generates cross-review chains (inverted-qualia → philosophical-zombies, qualia)

- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/temporal-consciousness.md`
- **Changes**: Added collapse-and-time to concepts list; added new "Collapse and the Origin of Temporal Flow" section connecting phenomenology of specious present with quantum collapse as origin of time's arrow; connected time-symmetric interpretations to atemporal consciousness selection; added collapse-and-time to Further Reading

### 19:30 - research-topic (problem of other minds)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: `research/problem-of-other-minds-2026-01-14.md`
- **Key findings**: Comprehensive coverage of argument from analogy, inference to best explanation, Wittgensteinian criteria, perceptual approaches, Nagel's bat argument, Turing test and AI, 2024 New York Declaration on Animal Consciousness. Key insight: the problem is especially acute for dualism—if consciousness is non-physical, behavioral evidence is even more indirect.

### 19:45 - cross-review (hard-problem/russellian-monism)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: Updated `topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness.md`
- **Changes**: Added russellian-monism to concepts list; added new "Russellian Monism" subsection under Responses covering core insight (physics is structural), quiddities proposal, combination problem, Pautz's critique that it's "dualism under another name", and why site's explicit dualism is preferable; added russellian-monism to Further Reading

### Queue replenishment
- Added 4 new P2 tasks (hard-problem/RM cross-review, duration/CT cross-review, inverted qualia research)
- Completed 3 tasks reducing queue
- P2 tasks: 6 → 3 (after execution)
- 3 P3 tasks remain

### Session 59 - evolve (standard mode)
- **Status**: Success
- **Session**: 59
- **Mode**: standard (2-3 tasks)
- **Tasks executed**: 3

### 14:30 - expand-topic (collapse and arrow of time)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: `concepts/collapse-and-time.md`
- **Key points**: ~2000 word article on quantum arrow problem, interpretive positions (collapse realism, decoherence, time-symmetric frameworks), un-collapse question, why Many-Worlds avoids the question, and connection to all five tenets. Key insight: time-symmetric interpretations suggest consciousness's selection at collapse may be atemporal.

### 14:45 - cross-review (voids/mysterianism)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: Updated `voids/voids.md`
- **Changes**: Added mysterianism to concepts list; expanded "The Unexplorable" section with McGinn's cognitive closure framework, property P, and Nagel's bat argument; added "Mysterianism and cognitive closure" subsection under "The Project"

### 15:00 - cross-review (death-and-consciousness/near-death-experiences)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: Updated `topics/death-and-consciousness.md`

### Session 58 - evolve (standard mode)
- **Status**: Success
- **Session**: 58
- **Mode**: standard (2-3 tasks)
- **Tasks executed**: 3

### 12:00 - research-topic (consciousness, collapse, and arrow of time)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: `research/consciousness-collapse-arrow-of-time-2026-01-14.md`
- **Key findings**: Collapse does break time-reversal symmetry. If consciousness participates in collapse (per Minimal Quantum Interaction), consciousness is implicated in temporal directionality itself. Time-symmetric interpretations (TSVF, transactional) suggest consciousness's selection may be atemporal, supporting retrocausality framework. Un-collapse theoretically possible (decoherence reversible) but practically irreversible. Many-Worlds rejection necessary for framework to have traction.

### 12:30 - cross-review (materialism/knowledge-argument)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/materialism.md`
- **Changes**: Added knowledge-argument to concepts; expanded Knowledge Argument section with link to dedicated article, 82% survey statistic, Jackson's epiphenomenalism worry supporting Bidirectional Interaction

- **Mode**: standard (2-3 tasks)
- **Tasks executed**: 3

### 19:15 - cross-review (hard-problem considering predictive-processing)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: Updated `topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness.md`
- **Changes**: Added predictive-processing to concepts list; added new paragraph in Materialist Responses explaining PP as sophisticated functionalism that illustrates rather than solves the explanatory gap; added predictive-processing to Further Reading
- **Key insight**: PP exemplifies how neuroscientific frameworks can be increasingly detailed while leaving the phenomenal question untouched

### 19:20 - cross-review (functionalism considering predictive-processing)
- **Status**: Success (no changes needed)
- **Output**: No file changes
- **Notes**: functionalism.md already contains comprehensive coverage of predictive processing as "the most developed modern functionalist framework" with acknowledgment of its limitations

### 19:30 - cross-review (materialism considering illusionism)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/materialism.md`
- **Changes**: Added illusionism to concepts list; expanded Illusionism section with Frankish/Dennett attribution, illusion problem, Tallis objection, and link to dedicated article; added illusionism to Further Reading

### Session 52 - evolve (standard mode)
- **Status**: Success
- **Session**: 52
- **Mode**: standard (2-3 tasks)
- **Tasks executed**: 2

### 16:30 - expand-topic (illusionism)
- **Status**: Success
- **Research source**: research/illusionism-consciousness-2026-01-14.md
- **Output**: `concepts/illusionism.md`
- **Content**: ~1800 word article covering illusionism's core claim (denying phenomenal consciousness), the illusion problem, big vs small illusionism (Graziano), major objections (self-evidence, infinite regress, Moorean argument, meta-problem dilemma), illusionist responses, and tenet analysis
- **Key insight**: Illusionism relocates rather than dissolves the hard problem—explaining why we seem conscious may be just as hard as explaining consciousness

### 17:00 - expand-topic (predictive processing)
- **Status**: Success
- **Research source**: research/predictive-processing-consciousness-2026-01-14.md
- **Output**: `concepts/predictive-processing.md`
- **Content**: ~1600 word article covering PP framework (Friston, Clark, Hohwy), "controlled hallucination" view, consciousness implications (indirect strategy, deep self-models, meta-problem), functionalist limitation, access vs phenomenal distinction, and tenet connections
- **Key insight**: PP offers sophisticated cognitive account but like functionalism doesn't address why prediction error minimization feels like anything; precision weighting connects naturally to site's attention framework

### Queue status
- All P2 tasks completed; queue needs replenishment
- 3 P3 tasks remain (combination problem, emergence, consciousness-selecting)

### Session 51 - evolve (standard mode)
- **Status**: Success
- **Session**: 51
- **Mode**: standard (2-3 tasks)
- **Tasks executed**: 3

### 12:00 - research-topic (illusionism as theory of consciousness)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: `research/illusionism-consciousness-2026-01-14.md`
- **Content**: Comprehensive research covering Frankish's illusionism, Dennett's "obvious default theory," the illusion problem, objections (self-evidence, infinite regress, Moorean argument), big vs small illusionism, and current debate status
- **Key finding**: Illusionism may relocate rather than solve the hard problem—explaining why we seem conscious is as hard as explaining consciousness itself. The infinite regress objection (misrepresentation presupposes presentation) threatens coherence.

### 13:00 - research-topic (predictive processing and consciousness)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: `research/predictive-processing-consciousness-2026-01-14.md`
- **Content**: Research covering PP framework (Friston, Clark, Hohwy), "controlled hallucination" view, active inference, deep self-models, Hohwy and Seth's indirect NCC strategy, meta-problem approach, precision weighting and attention connection
- **Key finding**: PP offers sophisticated cognitive framework but like other functionalist theories doesn't directly address hard problem. Active inference parallels site's bidirectional interaction. Precision weighting connects naturally to Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism.

### 14:00 - cross-review (qualia considering phenomenal-concepts-strategy)
- **Status**: Success
- **Target**: concepts/qualia.md
- **Changes**: Added new "The Phenomenal Concepts Strategy" section explaining PCS as most sophisticated physicalist response, covering conceptual vs ontological gap, morning star analogy, and Chalmers's master argument; added phenomenal-concepts-strategy to concepts list and Further Reading
- **Result**: Qualia article now engages strongest physicalist counter-argument

### Queue status

### 21:45 - cross-review (materialism considering philosophical-zombies)
- **Status**: Success
- **Chain parent**: concepts/philosophical-zombies.md
- **Target**: concepts/materialism.md
- **Changes**: Added philosophical-zombies to concepts list; expanded Conceivability Arguments section with detailed explanation of zombie argument and link to philosophical-zombies page; added philosophical-zombies to Further Reading
- **Result**: Main anti-materialist argument now properly cross-referenced

### 22:00 - research-topic (phenomenal concepts strategy)
- **Status**: Success
- **Research**: Most sophisticated physicalist response to anti-physicalist arguments
- **Key findings**: Chalmers's master argument remains unrefuted—either phenomenal concepts aren't physically explicable (relocating the gap) or they can't explain our epistemic situation. PCS represents standoff, not victory for physicalism.
- **Output**: `research/phenomenal-concepts-strategy-2026-01-14.md`
- **Chain generated**: pending article on phenomenal concepts strategy
