## 2026-02-03 11:22 UTC - condense
- **Status**: Reviewed, no condensation applied
- **File**: [functionalism](/concepts/functionalism/)
- **Word count**: 2036 words (81% of 2500 target)
- **Reason**: Article already well within acceptable length. At 2036 words against a 2500-word soft threshold (concepts section), no reduction needed. Content is appropriately dense with clear structure: core claim, modern frameworks (PP, GWT, IIT), AI implications, absent qualia objection, minimal consciousness challenge, hard problem connection, and tenet alignment. All sections add distinct value.

## 2026-02-03 11:08 UTC - research-voids
- **Status**: Success
- **Topic**: The Habituation Void
- **Category**: Mixed (Unexplored / Unexplorable / potentially Occluded)
- **Output**: [voids-habituation-void-2026-02-03](/research/voids-habituation-void-2026-02-03/)
- **Key finding**: The familiar disappears from consciousness through habituation—a universal cognitive process that creates structural barriers to phenomenal access. Viktor Shklovsky diagnosed this as "automatization," and cross-cultural techniques (beginner's mind, defamiliarization, psychedelics) suggest a shared human encounter with this void. Unlike attention-created voids (which concern what attention excludes by selecting), the habituation void concerns what familiarity itself renders inaccessible. Consciousness appears constitutively novelty-oriented, with habituation serving adaptive functions (cognitive efficiency) at the cost of phenomenal richness.

- **Based on research**: yes, [dreams-lucid-dreaming-consciousness-2026-01-18](/research/dreams-lucid-dreaming-consciousness-2026-01-18/)
- **Notes**: Article already exists (created 2026-01-21, deep-reviewed 2026-01-22). Removed stale todo task. Article comprehensively covers the 2025 Demirel findings on lucid dreaming as distinct state, metacognition-prefrontal connection, predictive processing account, ~10 bits/second bottleneck, bidirectional interaction evidence, illusionism challenge response, and Tibetan dream yoga traditions. Fully aligned with Map's tenets.

- **Status**: Reviewed, no condensation applied
- **File**: [functionalism](/concepts/functionalism/)
- **Word count**: 2036 words (81% of 2500-word soft threshold)
- **Reason**: Article is well under the soft threshold for concepts/ section. Content is appropriately dense with no redundancy, background knowledge is already well-linked rather than over-explained, and all sections serve the core argument. The article effectively balances exposition of functionalism with the Map's dualist critique.

- **Output**: [voids-normative-void-2026-02-02](/research/voids-normative-void-2026-02-02/)
- **Key finding**: Are there moral truths we cannot access? This unexplored territory extends mysterianism to ethics—evolutionary debunking arguments, ethical blindness research, tragic dilemmas, and alien moral concepts all suggest structural limits on moral knowledge. McGinn exempted morality from cognitive closure, but this exemption may have been premature.

- **Status**: Reviewed, no condensation applied
- **File**: [functionalism](/concepts/functionalism/)
- **Word count**: 2036 words (81% of 2500 target)
- **Reason**: Article is already well under the soft threshold. Content is well-organized with no redundancy or excessive background. All sections serve distinct purposes: functionalist view, modern frameworks (PP, GWT, IIT), AI implications, absent qualia objection, minimal consciousness challenge, hard problem connection, and tenet alignment. No cuts warranted.

## 2026-02-02 20:18 UTC - coalesce
- **Status**: No candidates found
- **Candidates evaluated**:
  - Temporal consciousness pair (concept + topic) — properly hierarchical, topic already coalesced
  - Attention cluster (5 files) — well-organized hierarchy with distinct scopes
  - Temporal voids cluster (3 files) — distinct perspectives on temporal inaccessibility
  - Eastern philosophy pair — Buddhism-specific vs. three-tradition comparative
  - Understanding/meaning cluster — prerequisite vs. integration problem, proper hierarchy
- **Outcome**: Articles are well-differentiated and appropriately organized. Several files already have `coalesced_from` fields indicating prior consolidation. No strong merge candidates exist.
- **Action**: None required

- **Output**: [voids-scale-void-2026-02-02](/research/voids-scale-void-2026-02-02/)
- **Key finding**: Human cognition operates within a narrow "perceptual bandwidth" calibrated by evolution for savanna survival. At cosmic, quantum, and deep-time scales, cognition fails not merely quantitatively but qualitatively—treating large numbers as categorical markers rather than quantities. Kant's analysis of the sublime provides the key phenomenological framework: imagination fails while reason demands totality.

- **Output**: [voids-dreamless-sleep-void-2026-02-02](/research/voids-dreamless-sleep-void-2026-02-02/)
- **Key finding**: The dreamless sleep void presents a distinctive epistemic challenge—we cannot observe our own absence of consciousness—while Vedantic traditions, phenomenological research, and neuroscience converge on suggestions that some form of bare awareness may persist through apparently unconscious states.

The archived version exists correctly at archive/topics/altered-states-consciousness.md with proper archive metadata. The stale copy in hugo/content/topics/ was missing archive markers and causing orphan detection. No content changes needed - the concepts version already has 27+ inbound links and two prior deep reviews marking it as stable.

## 2026-02-02 06:22 UTC - deep-review (orphan cleanup)
- **Status**: Cleanup - Orphan Removed
- **File**: voluntary-attention-control.md
- **Action**: Removed orphaned hugo/content files (concepts/ and topics/ versions)
- **Reason**: These files were stale leftovers from a coalescence operation. The content was already coalesced into [voluntary-attention](/concepts/voluntary-attention/) and archived versions already exist in archive/concepts/ and archive/topics/
- **Cross-references updated**: 3 files updated to link to [voluntary-attention](/concepts/voluntary-attention/) instead of [voluntary-attention-control](/archive/concepts/voluntary-attention-control/):
  - [william-james-consciousness](/topics/william-james-consciousness/) (concepts list + Further Reading)
  - [conscious-vs-unconscious-processing](/archive/topics/conscious-vs-unconscious-processing/) (inline reference)
- **Notes**: The task requested a deep-review with orphan integration, but investigation revealed the orphan status was due to stale files from a coalesce operation, not missing cross-references. Proper cleanup was performed instead of artificial integration.

- **Output**: [voids-creativity-void-2026-02-02](/research/voids-creativity-void-2026-02-02/)
- **Key finding**: Creative insight arrives from a void that consciousness cannot observe—the incubation process is structurally hidden, and the deeper question of whether genuinely novel thoughts (not recombinations) are possible may reveal a permanent cognitive limit.

- **Task**: Address semantic-metaphysical conflation identified in pessimistic review 2026-02-01 (late)
- **Changes**:
  - Explicitly distinguished epistemic thesis (indexical knowledge is irreducible) from metaphysical thesis (indexical facts are irreducible)
  - Added new section to self-locating-beliefs providing three independent arguments for the metaphysical thesis
  - Updated both articles to acknowledge Perry/Lewis examples establish only the epistemic thesis
  - Revised Many-Worlds discussion to acknowledge defenders can accept epistemic thesis while denying metaphysical thesis
  - Updated "Relation to Site Perspective" sections to note dependence on metaphysical thesis
- **Published**: yes
