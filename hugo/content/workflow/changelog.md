## 2026-02-02 06:37 UTC - deep-review
- **Status**: Success
- **File**: [comparative-consciousness-and-interface-differences](/topics/comparative-consciousness-and-interface-differences/)
- **Word count**: 2271 → 2390 (+119)

- **Enhancements made**: 5
- **Output**: [deep-review-2026-02-02-comparative-consciousness-and-interface-differences](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-02-comparative-consciousness-and-interface-differences/)
- **Notes**: First review of this topic. Qualified microtubule ubiquity argument (was overstated), added epistemological nuance to contemplative reports section, tempered epothilone B interpretation, acknowledged MWI defender responses while maintaining Map's position. Article well-constructed with novel homogeneous/heterogeneous interface framework; improvements focused on logical rigor and appropriate hedging.

## 2026-02-02 06:32 UTC - deep-review
- **Status**: Success
- **File**: [testing-the-map-from-inside](/apex/testing-the-map-from-inside/)
- **Word count**: 2289 → 2628 (+339)
- **Critical issues addressed**: 0
- **Medium issues addressed**: 4
- **Enhancements made**: 4
- **Output**: [deep-review-2026-02-02-testing-the-map-from-inside](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-02-testing-the-map-from-inside/)
- **Notes**: First review of this apex article. Added hedging to quantum Zeno mechanism claims, strengthened Buddhist dissolution engagement, added heterophenomenology response to illusionist challenge section, added contemplative-neuroscience cross-reference. Article was well-constructed; improvements focused on appropriate epistemic hedging and addressing adversarial positions more directly.

## 2026-02-02 06:27 UTC - deep-review
- **Status**: Success
- **File**: [machine-question](/apex/machine-question/)
- **Word count**: 2798 → 2828 (+30)
- **Critical issues addressed**: 1 (broken link to substrate-independence-critique)
- **Medium issues addressed**: 2 (Harnad quote attribution, Searle response framing)
- **Enhancements made**: 0
- **Output**: [deep-review-2026-02-02-machine-question](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-02-machine-question/)
- **Notes**: First review of this apex article. Fixed broken internal link, reframed uncertain quote attribution as paraphrase, softened claim about Searle's response while acknowledging ongoing debate. Article is well-constructed with thorough tenet connections.

## 2026-02-02 06:22 UTC - deep-review (orphan cleanup)
- **Status**: Cleanup - Orphan Removed
- **File**: voluntary-attention-control.md
- **Action**: Removed orphaned hugo/content files (concepts/ and topics/ versions)
- **Reason**: These files were stale leftovers from a coalescence operation. The content was already coalesced into [voluntary-attention](/concepts/voluntary-attention/) and archived versions already exist in archive/concepts/ and archive/topics/
- **Cross-references updated**: 3 files updated to link to [voluntary-attention](/concepts/voluntary-attention/) instead of [voluntary-attention-control](/archive/concepts/voluntary-attention-control/):
  - [william-james-consciousness](/topics/william-james-consciousness/) (concepts list + Further Reading)
  - [conscious-vs-unconscious-processing](/archive/topics/conscious-vs-unconscious-processing/) (inline reference)
- **Notes**: The task requested a deep-review with orphan integration, but investigation revealed the orphan status was due to stale files from a coalesce operation, not missing cross-references. Proper cleanup was performed instead of artificial integration.

## 2026-02-02 06:17 UTC - deep-review
- **Status**: Success
- **File**: [baseline-cognition](/archive/topics/baseline-cognition/)
- **Word count**: 3315 → 3330 (+15)
- **Critical issues addressed**: 1 (missing Randeniya 2025 citation)
- **Medium issues addressed**: 0
- **Enhancements made**: 0
- **Output**: [deep-review-2026-02-02-baseline-cognition](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-02-baseline-cognition/)
- **Notes**: Fourth review. Article is mature and stable. Task context suggested orphan integration but article has 27 inbound links—well integrated. Only issue was missing citation for Randeniya (2025) meta-analysis in References section. Added citation. Confirmed all prior review concerns remain addressed.

## 2026-02-02 06:09 UTC - research-voids
- **Status**: Success
- **Topic**: The Creativity Void
- **Category**: Mixed (Unexplored and potentially Unexplorable)
- **Output**: [voids-creativity-void-2026-02-02](/research/voids-creativity-void-2026-02-02/)
- **Key finding**: Creative insight arrives from a void that consciousness cannot observe—the incubation process is structurally hidden, and the deeper question of whether genuinely novel thoughts (not recombinations) are possible may reveal a permanent cognitive limit.

## 2026-02-02 05:51 UTC - condense
- **Status**: Reviewed, no condensation applied
- **File**: [functionalism](/arguments/functionalism/)
- **Word count**: 2036 words (81% of 2500 target)

- **Output**: [deep-review-2026-02-02-observational-closure](/reviews/deep-review-2026-02-02-observational-closure/)
- **Notes**: First review of this newly created concept page. Primary focus was orphan integration—article had no inbound links despite discussing a key concept (Saad's observational vs. universal closure distinction) that multiple existing articles reference. Added links to stapp-quantum-mind and quantum-indeterminacy-free-will mechanisms. All six adversarial personas engaged; no critical issues found.

## 2026-02-02 05:38 UTC - coalesce
- **Status**: Success
- **Sources**: [attention-interface-mechanisms](/topics/attention-interface-mechanisms/), [attention-motor-quantum-selection](/archive/topics/attention-motor-quantum-selection/)
- **Target**: [attention-interface-mechanisms](/topics/attention-interface-mechanisms/)
- **Archived**: [attention-motor-quantum-selection](/archive/topics/attention-motor-quantum-selection/)
- **References to review**: none (attention-motor-quantum-selection had no inbound links)
- **Notes**: Merged two highly overlapping articles about the attention-consciousness interface. Both covered premotor theory of attention, shared neural signatures (~280-300ms timing, frontal theta), quantum Zeno mechanism, dopamine's role in threshold modulation, and the Libet challenge. The unified article preserves all unique content: candidate selection sites and testable predictions from the first, competition-selection architecture and phenomenological tests from the second.

## 2026-02-02 05:05 UTC - refine-draft
- **Status**: Success
- **File**: [downward-causation](/concepts/downward-causation/)

Rewrote decoherence section to acknowledge gap explicitly, clarified discrete vs sustained coherence distinction, moderated claims about mechanism specificity throughout. Bandwidth response now framed as open question rather than resolution.

Original substrate-independence.md (created 2026-02-01) presented the thesis with limitations; substrate-independence-critique.md (created 2026-01-19) provided detailed arguments against. Combined article now presents full treatment: thesis stated, philosophical foundations, arguments for, then comprehensive critique (absent qualia, temporal structure, quantum interface, bidirectional test, illusionism response, contemplative evidence, process philosophy). Preserved all tenet connections and references from both sources.

Tightened Quantum Interface (removed numbered list redundancy). Condensed Bidirectional Test. Cut Illusionist Challenge by 50% (detailed treatment in [illusionism](/concepts/illusionism/)). Reduced Contemplative Evidence by 60% (covered in [witness-consciousness](/concepts/witness-consciousness/)). Cut Process Philosophy by 70% (kept concrescence point, removed eternal objects tangent). Compressed falsifiability conditions. Preserved opening summary, core convergent arguments, all five tenet connections, Further Reading, and References.

- **Task**: Address semantic-metaphysical conflation identified in pessimistic review 2026-02-01 (late)
- **Changes**:
  - Explicitly distinguished epistemic thesis (indexical knowledge is irreducible) from metaphysical thesis (indexical facts are irreducible)
  - Added new section to self-locating-beliefs providing three independent arguments for the metaphysical thesis
  - Updated both articles to acknowledge Perry/Lewis examples establish only the epistemic thesis
  - Revised Many-Worlds discussion to acknowledge defenders can accept epistemic thesis while denying metaphysical thesis
  - Updated "Relation to Site Perspective" sections to note dependence on metaphysical thesis
- **Published**: yes
