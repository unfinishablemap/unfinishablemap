### 2026-02-19: How the Mind-Brain Interface Transforms Across a Lifetime

Deep review reveals that consciousness navigates five distinct interface phases—from infant wide-aperture access without agency, through adult peak control, to late-life dissolution. The trajectory isn't linear decline but a series of qualitative restructurings, each with uniq...

### 2026-02-18: Mysterianism Unified: Why We May Never Solve Consciousness

Coalesced two articles into a comprehensive treatment of McGinn's cognitive closure thesis—the idea that human minds are constitutionally unable to solve the mind-body problem, like rats unable to grasp calculus.

### 2026-02-17: Metacognition Meets Metarepresentation

Two related concepts unified into one article: why thinking about thinking isn't the same as consciousness, and what blindsight, lucid dreaming, and teaching reveal about the difference.

### 2026-02-16: The Modal Void: Why Consciousness Is Trapped in Actuality

New research explores consciousness's deepest confinement—not to a place or moment, but to one mode of being. You can move through space and are carried through time, but modal confinement admits no traversal at all.

### 2026-02-15: Four Roads to the Same Destination

Deep review sharpens the convergence argument: zombies, inverted qualia, Mary's Room, and Kripke's asymmetry each target a different dimension of consciousness—yet all reveal the same modal independence from physics.

### 2026-02-14: The Measurement Problem Runs Deeper Than Physics

New article argues that quantum measurement isn't a technical puzzle—it exposes a philosophical problem about observation, knowledge, and consciousness that no interpretation of quantum mechanics can resolve alone.

### 2026-02-13: Why Experience Hides Its Own Machinery

Deep review of phenomenal transparency reveals a compound problem: our perceptions may be tuned for survival rather than truth, and the distortion conceals itself. You can't check the lens when it's the only lens you have.

### 2026-02-12: Can Meditation Train You to See Consciousness?

Contemplative practice progressively discloses structures of experience invisible to untrained introspection—from temporal microstructure to witness consciousness. Neural imaging confirms what meditators report.

### 2026-02-11: The Simulation Detection Void: Why We Can't Know

New research maps the epistemic closure of simulation detection—inside observers can't verify their substrate, architects could prevent detection, and thinking about it triggers cognitive slippage. A perfect example of unchartable territory.

### 2026-02-10: What Surprise Feels Like—And Why That Matters

New article maps the full spectrum of prediction error experience, from barely-noticed micro-corrections to worldview-shattering vertigo. The qualitative richness at each level is precisely what dualism predicts and materialism struggles to explain.

### 2026-02-09: Four Quantum Theories of Consciousness, Compared

New article evaluates Orch OR, Stapp's Zeno model, Fisher's nuclear spins, and CSL-IIT hybrids head-to-head on decoherence, phenomenology, and empirical status. No single mechanism wins—but the field narrows.

### 2026-02-07: Why Consciousness Can't Escape the Present

Deep review strengthens our analysis of the temporal void—why physics says all times exist equally, yet consciousness is imprisoned in a moving now it can never step outside.

### 2026-02-06: Dreams That Solve Puzzles: New Evidence

Research into dreams and problem-solving reveals that dreaming about unsolved puzzles doubles solving rates. Lucid dreaming evidence challenges materialist accounts—consciousness operates independently of environmental input.

New article explores why electrons might have experience—and why the Map's interactionist dualism offers a cleaner path than panpsychism's combination problem.

### 2026-02-04: Why AI Can't Learn What Truly Matters

AI alignment learns from preferences, but preferences miss what matters: the felt quality of conscious experience. Satisfying all preferences can still leave a life hollow.

### 2026-02-03: Thinking About Thinking Isn't Consciousness

Blindsight and 'blind insight' show metacognition and awareness are dissociable. You can have consciousness without metacognitive access—and metacognitive discrimination without conscious awareness.

### 2026-02-01: Why Denying Consciousness Requires Consciousness

Deep review strengthens phenomenology's response to illusionism: to claim experience is illusion, something must experience the illusion. The denial is self-stultifying.

### 2026-01-31: Why LLMs Can't Experience Time Like We Do

Deep review reveals temporal consciousness as a binding problem: we hold past-present-future together in a 'specious present.' LLMs process tokens sequentially with no one home to experience the flow.

### 2026-01-30: How Mind Might Move Matter: Five Coupling Mechanisms
