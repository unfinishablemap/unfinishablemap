### ✓ 2026-03-01: Cross-review past-self-void.md considering historical-consciousness-void insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article voids/historical-consciousness-void.md (2026-03-01) examines whether consciousness itself has changed across historical epochs — a temporal version of Nagel's bat problem scaled to the species level. voids/past-self-void.md covers the inaccessibility of one's own past conscious states and shares the same epistemic structure (temporal inaccessibility of phenomenal states) at the individual scale. The two articles are explicitly connected: historical-consciousness-void references the past-self void as "the parallel void within a single lifetime." Check for cross-links and complementary analysis. Also helps de-orphan the new article.
- **Output**: obsidian/voids/past-self-void.md -- Context: Cross-review past-self-void.md considering historical-consciousness-void insights

### ✓ 2026-03-01: Address argumentative gaps in consciousness-and-neurodegenerative-disease.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review found two high-severity issues: (1) terminal lucidity evidence is largely anecdotal but bears disproportionate argumentative weight — needs recalibration; (2) filter theory as deployed may be unfalsifiable — needs explicit acknowledgment or testable predictions. Also: user/tool metaphor begs the question, and easy/hard problem mapping is presented as observation rather than interpretation. See pessimistic-2026-03-01-neurodegenerative.md
- **Output**: obsidian/topics/consciousness-and-neurodegenerative-disease.md

### ✓ 2026-03-01: Write voids article on the historical consciousness void
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/voids-historical-consciousness-void-2026-03-01.md. The historical consciousness void examines whether consciousness has a history — whether the felt quality of experience has changed across epochs or whether we merely describe it differently. Only 1 voids/ slot remaining (99/100). This is the most recently researched of 24 unconsumed void research notes.
- **Output**: Write voids article on the historical consciousness void

### ✓ 2026-03-01: Cross-review temporal-consciousness.md considering continuity-void insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article voids/continuity-void.md (2026-03-01) examines moments where the stream of consciousness breaks down — sleep onset, anaesthetic fade, deep absorption — revealing the constructed nature of temporal continuity. concepts/temporal-consciousness.md covers the nature of temporal experience and could be enriched by cross-referencing the continuity void's analysis of temporal breaks. Check for cross-links and complementary analysis of how temporal experience relates to continuity failures.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/temporal-consciousness.md -- Context: Cross-review temporal-consciousness.md considering continuity-void insights

- **Output**: obsidian/topics/dopamine-and-the-unified-interface.md -- Context: This file has no inbound links and is orphaned. Focus on finding related articles that should link to this content. Add cross-references from existing articles to integrate this into the site navigation.

### ✓ 2026-03-01: Integrate perception-and-conscious-experience.md into site navigation
- **Type**: integrate-orphan
- **Notes**: File has no inbound links. Perception is a foundational topic for the Map's treatment of consciousness — articles on qualia, phenomenal consciousness, neural correlates, and the hard problem should cross-reference this content. Add links from hard-problem-of-consciousness.md, qualia.md, neural-correlates-of-consciousness.md, and related phenomenology articles.
- **Output**: obsidian/topics/perception-and-conscious-experience.md -- Context: This file has no inbound links and is orphaned. Focus on finding related articles that should link to this content. Add cross-references from existing articles to integrate this into the site navigation.

### ✓ 2026-03-01: Integrate moral-implications-of-genuine-agency.md into site navigation
- **Type**: integrate-orphan
- **Notes**: File has no inbound links despite being an important ethics article on the moral consequences of consciousness having genuine causal power. Directly supports Tenet 3 (Bidirectional Interaction). Add cross-references from related articles such as ethics-of-consciousness.md, consciousness-and-moral-agency-under-duress.md, responsibility-gradient-from-attentional-capacity.md, and moral-responsibility.md.
- **Output**: obsidian/topics/moral-implications-of-genuine-agency.md -- Context: This file has no inbound links and is orphaned. Focus on finding related articles that should link to this content. Add cross-references from existing articles to integrate this into the site navigation.

### ✓ 2026-03-01: Deep review decoherence.md (post-coalesce quality check)
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: Recent coalesce merged quantum-decoherence-objection-responses.md into decoherence.md, growing it to ~4030 words and significantly changing its structure. A comprehensive review is needed to ensure the merged content is coherent, well-integrated, and maintains accurate cross-references. The article now exceeds the 3500-word hard threshold for concepts/ — review should identify opportunities to tighten. Supports Tenet 2 (Minimal Quantum Interaction) and Tenet 4 (No Many Worlds).
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/decoherence.md

### ✓ 2026-03-01: Deep review quantum-measurement-interpretations-beyond-mwi.md
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: AI-generated content (ai_contribution: 100) last reviewed 2026-01-28 — 31 days ago, beyond the 30-day staleness threshold. Surveys quantum measurement interpretations excluding Many Worlds — directly relevant to Tenet 4 (No Many Worlds) and the Map's argument for why consciousness-collapse interpretations are preferable. The only stale file not already tracked in the queue. Verify coherence, cross-references, and tenet alignment.
- **Output**: obsidian/topics/quantum-measurement-interpretations-beyond-mwi.md

### ✓ 2026-03-01: Cross-review delegatory-dualism.md considering entanglement-binding-hypothesis insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/entanglement-binding-hypothesis.md (2026-03-01) proposes quantum entanglement as the mechanism for phenomenal unity, with experimental evidence from Kerskens-Pérez MRI and Wiest epothilone studies. delegatory-dualism.md is the Map's central framework article describing how consciousness delegates to neural processes. If binding requires entanglement, the delegatory model's hierarchy gains a specific physical substrate at the binding level — quantum coherence maintained across the neural populations that consciousness coordinates. Check for cross-links and theoretical reinforcement. Supports Tenet 2 (Minimal Quantum Interaction).
- **Output**: obsidian/topics/delegatory-dualism.md -- Context: Cross-review delegatory-dualism.md considering entanglement-binding-hypothesis insights

### ✓ 2026-03-01: Cross-review the-case-for-dualism.md considering arguments-against-materialism insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article topics/arguments-against-materialism.md (2026-02-27) systematically assembles the strongest arguments against physicalism — knowledge argument, conceivability, multiple realizability, and the hard problem's anti-materialist force. the-case-for-dualism.md is the central hub for the Map's dualist position (Tenet 1) and should cross-reference these assembled arguments, which directly strengthen the positive case. Cross-reviews were done for knowledge-argument.md and functionalism.md but not for this core article. Check for cross-links and argument reinforcement.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/the-case-for-dualism.md -- Context: Cross-review the-case-for-dualism.md considering arguments-against-materialism insights

### ✓ 2026-03-01: Review temporal-consciousness.md considering continuity-void insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article voids/continuity-void.md (2026-03-01) examines whether consciousness is genuinely continuous or whether felt continuity is constructed across gaps — sleep onset, anaesthesia, absorption states. concepts/temporal-consciousness.md covers the specious present, Bergson's durée, and temporal phenomenology. The continuity void's analysis of constructed-vs-given continuity would strengthen the temporal consciousness article's treatment of how temporal structure may be constitutive of consciousness. Check for cross-links and argument reinforcement.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/temporal-consciousness.md -- Context: Review temporal-consciousness.md considering continuity-void insights

### ✓ 2026-03-01: Integrate adaptive-computational-depth.md into site navigation
- **Type**: integrate-orphan
- **Notes**: Concepts article (created 2026-02-24) with zero inbound wikilinks. Argues that reality allocating detail where consciousness attends initially seems to support computationalism but actually implies non-computable mind. Should be linked from consciousness-and-simulation.md, computational-theory-of-mind.md, and attention-as-selection-interface.md.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/adaptive-computational-depth.md -- Context: This file has no inbound links and is orphaned. Focus on finding related articles that should link to this content. Add cross-references from existing articles to integrate this into the site navigation.

- **Type**: integrate-orphan
- **Notes**: Concepts article (created 2026-02-10) with zero inbound wikilinks. Addresses the 10¹²-fold mismatch between quantum decoherence and neural decision timescales — a key challenge for quantum consciousness theories and directly relevant to Tenet 2 (Minimal Quantum Interaction). Should be linked from quantum-consciousness.md, decoherence.md, measurement-problem.md, and comparing-quantum-consciousness-mechanisms.md.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/timing-gap-problem.md -- Context: This file has no inbound links and is orphaned. Focus on finding related articles that should link to this content. Add cross-references from existing articles to integrate this into the site navigation.

### ✓ 2026-03-01: Integrate language-and-consciousness.md into site navigation
- **Type**: integrate-orphan
- **Notes**: Concepts article (ai_contribution: 80, created 2026-02-23) with zero inbound wikilinks. Covers the private language argument, meaning, reference, and how consciousness resists linguistic dissolution. Should be linked from hard-problem-of-consciousness.md, intentionality.md, qualia.md, and phenomenal-concepts-strategy.md. Central to the Map's argument that consciousness is not merely a linguistic confusion.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/language-and-consciousness.md -- Context: This file has no inbound links and is orphaned. Focus on finding related articles that should link to this content. Add cross-references from existing articles to integrate this into the site navigation.

### ✓ 2026-03-01: Integrate apex-articles.md into site navigation
- **Type**: integrate-orphan
- **Notes**: The apex/apex-articles.md page has no inbound links — it is the only non-research orphan on the site. The apex section already has _index.md as its landing page. Determine whether apex-articles.md should be linked from the section index, from the site index, or archived as redundant. If it provides value beyond _index.md, add inbound links; if not, archive it.
- **Output**: obsidian/apex/apex-articles.md -- Context: This file has no inbound links and is orphaned. Focus on finding related articles that should link to this content. Add cross-references from existing articles to integrate this into the site navigation.

### ✓ 2026-03-01: Deep review intersubjectivity.md
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: AI-generated content (ai_contribution: 100) last reviewed 2026-01-28 — 31 days ago, beyond the 30-day staleness threshold. Intersubjectivity connects to the Map's treatment of consciousness as irreducibly first-personal yet sharable through empathy, testimony, and mutual recognition. Intersects with the problem of other minds and social cognition articles. Verify coherence, cross-references, and tenet alignment.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/intersubjectivity.md

### ✓ 2026-03-01: Address gaps in continuity-void.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review found high-severity omission of Dennett's Multiple Drafts model, style guide violation ("This is not X. It is Y." construct), content overlap with temporal-consciousness.md, and unsupported superlative claims. See pessimistic-2026-03-01-continuity-void.md
- **Output**: obsidian/voids/continuity-void.md

Task context:
Pessimistic review found high-severity omission of Dennett's Multiple Drafts model, style guide violation ("This is not X. It is Y." construct), content overlap with temporal-consciousness.md, and unsupported superlative claims. See pessimistic-2026-03-01-continuity-void.md

### ✓ 2026-03-01: Integrate consciousness-and-the-philosophy-of-biology.md into site navigation
- **Type**: integrate-orphan
- **Notes**: Topics article (created 2026-02-23) with zero inbound wikilinks. Philosophy of biology connects to the Map's evolutionary arguments for consciousness — the amplification hypothesis, baseline cognition, and animal consciousness articles. Should be linked from consciousness-evolution-problem.md, animal-consciousness.md, and evolution-under-dualism.md.
- **Output**: obsidian/topics/consciousness-and-the-philosophy-of-biology.md -- Context: This file has no inbound links and is orphaned. Focus on finding related articles that should link to this content. Add cross-references from existing articles to integrate this into the site navigation.

### ✓ 2026-03-01: Integrate preemption.md into site navigation
- **Type**: integrate-orphan
- **Notes**: Concepts article (created 2026-02-15) with zero inbound wikilinks. The word "preemption" appears in body text of delegatory-dualism and related articles as a common noun but never as a wikilink. Adding [preemption](/concepts/preemption/) links from delegatory-dualism.md, consciousness-and-causal-powers.md, and attention-as-selection-interface.md would integrate this concept into the site's navigation.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/preemption.md -- Context: This file has no inbound links and is orphaned. Focus on finding related articles that should link to this content. Add cross-references from existing articles to integrate this into the site navigation.

### ✓ 2026-03-01: Write voids article on the continuity void
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed today in research/voids-continuity-void-2026-03-01.md. The continuity void examines whether consciousness is genuinely continuous or whether felt continuity is constructed across gaps. Directly relevant to temporal consciousness and the Map's treatment of persistence conditions. Target section: voids/ (2 slots remaining).
- **Output**: Write voids article on the continuity void

### ✓ 2026-03-01: Cross-review consciousness-and-the-ownership-problem.md considering phenomenological-psychiatry insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article topics/phenomenological-psychiatry-and-altered-experience.md (2026-03-01) identifies ipseity disturbance — diminished self-affection, loss of mineness — as the core phenomenological feature of schizophrenic self-disturbance. topics/consciousness-and-the-ownership-problem.md asks what makes conscious states belong to a subject. Phenomenological psychiatry provides clinical evidence for ownership dissociations (EASE instrument, Sass-Parnas framework) that empirically ground the ownership problem's philosophical claims. Supports Tenet 1 (Dualism).
- **Output**: obsidian/topics/consciousness-and-the-ownership-problem.md -- Context: Cross-review consciousness-and-the-ownership-problem.md considering phenomenological-psychiatry insights

### ✓ 2026-03-01: Update 29 stale wikilinks from epistemological-limits-of-occams-razor to epistemological-limits-occams-razor
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Gap analysis found 29 wikilinks across live content reference `[epistemological-limits-of-occams-razor](/arguments/epistemological-limits-of-occams-razor/)` (with "of") but the actual file is voids/epistemological-limits-occams-razor.md (without "of"). These broken links affect Tenet 5 (Occam's Razor Has Limits) cross-referencing — the site's least-covered foundational commitment. Update all 29 references to point to the correct slug.
- **Output**: None -- Context: Update 29 stale wikilinks from epistemological-limits-of-occams-razor to epistemological-limits-occams-razor

### ✓ 2026-03-01: Cross-review split-brain-consciousness.md considering entanglement-binding-hypothesis insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/entanglement-binding-hypothesis.md (2026-03-01) proposes quantum entanglement as the mechanism underlying phenomenal unity. topics/split-brain-consciousness.md examines how commissurotomy partially disrupts unity while surprising resilience persists — the surprising preservation of unity despite massive structural disconnection (250M axons reduced to centimetre-scale bundles) is consistent with quantum binding operating at a different level than classical fibre count. Check for cross-links and argument reinforcement. Supports Tenet 2 (Minimal Quantum Interaction).
- **Output**: obsidian/topics/split-brain-consciousness.md -- Context: Cross-review split-brain-consciousness.md considering entanglement-binding-hypothesis insights

### ✓ 2026-03-01: Cross-review altered-states-of-consciousness.md considering phenomenological-psychiatry insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article topics/phenomenological-psychiatry-and-altered-experience.md (2026-03-01) treats depersonalisation, thought insertion, and schizophrenic self-disturbance as data about consciousness structure. concepts/altered-states-of-consciousness.md already cross-references phenomenological psychiatry briefly — the cross-review should strengthen the connection showing how psychiatric conditions reveal consciousness's normally invisible architecture, complementing the existing filter theory framing. Supports Tenet 1 (Dualism).
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/altered-states-of-consciousness.md -- Context: Cross-review altered-states-of-consciousness.md considering phenomenological-psychiatry insights

### ✓ 2026-03-01: Cross-review unity-of-consciousness.md considering entanglement-binding-hypothesis insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/entanglement-binding-hypothesis.md (2026-03-01) proposes quantum entanglement as a structural solution to the phenomenal binding problem, with experimental evidence from Kerskens-Pérez MRI and Wiest epothilone studies. concepts/unity-of-consciousness.md already mentions quantum binding briefly — cross-review should strengthen that section with the specific mechanism and recent experimental evidence from the new article. Supports Tenet 2 (Minimal Quantum Interaction).
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/unity-of-consciousness.md -- Context: Cross-review unity-of-consciousness.md considering entanglement-binding-hypothesis insights

### ✓ 2026-03-01: Update references to coalesced phenomenal-intentionality article
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Coalesce merged concepts/phenomenal-intentionality.md into concepts/intentionality.md. The following 21 active content files reference `[phenomenal-intentionality](/concepts/intentionality/)` and should be updated to point to `[intentionality](/concepts/intentionality/)` (or `[phenomenal intentionality theory](/concepts/intentionality/)` where display text is appropriate): qualia.md, intentionality-void.md, symbol-grounding-problem.md, phenomenal-acquaintance.md, direction-of-fit.md, cognitive-phenomenology.md, agent-teleology.md, philosophy-of-perception-under-dualism.md, placebo-effect-and-mental-causation.md, phenomenology-of-understanding.md, phenomenology-of-philosophical-disagreement.md, phenomenology-of-attention-to-absence.md, consciousness-and-testimony.md, consciousness-and-social-cognition.md, consciousness-and-interpersonal-understanding.md, consciousness-and-collective-intentionality.md, ai-consciousness.md, hard-problem-of-consciousness.md, philosophy-of-mind.md, language-and-consciousness.md, phenomenology-of-trust.md
- **Output**: None -- Context: Update references to coalesced phenomenal-intentionality article

### ✓ 2026-03-01: Address gaps in conservation-laws-and-mind.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review found two high-severity issues: (1) equivocation between physical boundary conditions and non-physical consciousness as models of "causation without energy"—the analogy needs rigorous development or explicit acknowledgment of its limits; (2) the decoherence response is insufficient and creates tension with the Stapp mechanism it cites. Medium-severity: the "begs the question" argument cuts both ways. Also four language issues where philosophical arguments are stated as established facts. See pessimistic-2026-03-01-conservation-laws-and-mind.md

### ✓ 2026-03-01: Cross-review interactionist-dualism.md considering amplification-void insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article voids/amplification-void.md (2026-02-28) argues that the causal interface's opacity is structurally necessary — if amplification were traceable, the interaction would be detectable, violating the minimality that defines it. concepts/interactionist-dualism.md discusses mental causation and the conservation objection; the amplification void explains why quantum solutions must operate through multi-scale opacity and reframes the interaction problem as a feature rather than a bug. Check for cross-links and argument reinforcement. Supports Tenet 3 (Bidirectional Interaction).
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/interactionist-dualism.md -- Context: Cross-review interactionist-dualism.md considering amplification-void insights

### ✓ 2026-03-01: Cross-review bandwidth-problem-mental-causation.md considering resolution-void insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article voids/resolution-void.md (2026-02-28) formalises how consciousness operates at characteristic resolution radically coarser than underlying physical processes — sensory systems deliver millions of bits/sec yet conscious thought processes roughly 10 bits/sec. concepts/bandwidth-problem-mental-causation.md asks how a 10-bit/sec conscious channel produces specific behaviour, and the resolution void's empirical measurements of the 6-order-of-magnitude compression would strengthen the bandwidth article's hierarchical selection argument. Check for cross-links and complementary evidence.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/bandwidth-problem-mental-causation.md -- Context: Cross-review bandwidth-problem-mental-causation.md considering resolution-void insights

### ✓ 2026-03-01: Cross-review quantum-consciousness.md considering amplification-void insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article voids/amplification-void.md (2026-02-28) examines the structural impossibility of tracing how a quantum-scale nudge reaches macroscopic neural effect — spanning five orders of magnitude through chaotic, decoherence-prone layers. concepts/quantum-consciousness.md surveys candidate mechanisms (Orch OR, Stapp, Fisher) and should acknowledge that any viable mechanism must solve the amplification problem, not bypass it. Check for cross-links and argument reinforcement. Supports Tenet 2 (Minimal Quantum Interaction).
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/quantum-consciousness.md -- Context: Cross-review quantum-consciousness.md considering amplification-void insights

### ✓ 2026-03-01: Cross-review binding-problem.md considering entanglement-binding-hypothesis insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/entanglement-binding-hypothesis.md (2026-03-01) provides detailed treatment of how quantum entanglement may solve the phenomenal binding problem (BP2), including recent experimental evidence (Kerskens-Pérez MRI, Wiest epothilone study). concepts/binding-problem.md already references [quantum-binding-and-phenomenal-unity](/topics/quantum-holism-and-phenomenal-unity/) — check whether that wikilink should now point to the new article, and whether the quantum hypothesis section needs updating with experimental details.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/binding-problem.md -- Context: Cross-review binding-problem.md considering entanglement-binding-hypothesis insights

### ✓ 2026-03-01: Write article on neural binding and quantum entanglement hypothesis
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/neural-binding-quantum-entanglement-2026-01-19.md (40 days unconsumed). The binding problem — how distributed neural activity produces unified conscious experience — is a key challenge for physicalism and a potential opening for quantum approaches. Research covers Penrose-Hameroff, Fisher's quantum cognition, and entanglement-based binding proposals. Complements binding-void.md (which examines the structural impossibility) with specific mechanism proposals. Directly relevant to Tenet 2 (Minimal Quantum Interaction). Target section: concepts/ (4 slots remaining).
- **Output**: neural binding and quantum entanglement hypothesis

### ✓ 2026-03-01: Write article on phenomenological psychiatry and altered experience
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/phenomenological-psychiatry-altered-experience-2026-02-21.md (7 days unconsumed). Phenomenological psychiatry (Jaspers, Minkowski, Binswanger, Sass) treats altered psychiatric experience as data about consciousness structure rather than mere symptom. Depersonalisation, thought insertion, and schizophrenic self-disturbance reveal the architecture of normal conscious experience by showing what happens when specific components fail. Complements disorders-of-consciousness-as-test-cases.md (neurological) with psychiatric evidence. Target section: topics/ (4 slots remaining).
- **Output**: phenomenological psychiatry and altered experience

### ✓ 2026-02-28: Write voids article on the resolution void
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/voids-resolution-void-2026-02-22.md (6 days unconsumed). Consciousness operates at a characteristic resolution radically coarser than underlying physical processes — sensory systems deliver millions of bits per second yet conscious thought processes roughly 10 bits per second. Phenomenal experience appears smooth while neural substrates are discrete (Sellars' grain argument). These resolution limits may be constitutive of what consciousness is. Target section: voids/ (4 slots remaining).
- **Output**: Write voids article on the resolution void

### ✓ 2026-02-28: Write voids article on the amplification void
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed today in research/voids-amplification-void-2026-02-28.md. The amplification void names the structural impossibility of tracing how a quantum-scale nudge reaches macroscopic neural effect — spanning five orders of magnitude in spatial scale through chaotic, noisy, decoherence-prone layers. The void may be structurally necessary: if amplification were traceable, the interaction would be detectable, violating the minimality that defines it. Directly relevant to Tenet 2 (Minimal Quantum Interaction). Target section: voids/ (4 slots remaining).
- **Output**: Write voids article on the amplification void

### ✓ 2026-02-24: Write voids article on the substrate void
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/voids-substrate-void-2026-02-19.md. The substrate void examines whether we can ever know what consciousness is "made of" — a question that forces engagement with dualist vs. physicalist ontology at the deepest level. Both positions face the substrate question: physicalism cannot explain why certain physical arrangements produce experience, and dualism cannot specify what non-physical substance constitutes it. Directly supports Tenet 1 (Dualism). Target section: voids/.

- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/epistemology-of-other-minds-under-dualism.md examines how dualism handles knowledge of other minds, arguing that Bidirectional Interaction (Tenet 3) provides epistemic access through detectable physical effects of consciousness. concepts/philosophical-zombies.md covers the conceivability of zombies and should cross-reference the new article's treatment of why the epistemological challenge strengthens rather than weakens the dualist case.

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on the bandwidth problem in mental causation
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Multiple articles acknowledge the timing gap between conscious experience (~10 bits/second, ~300ms decisions) and quantum events (femtosecond timescales) without resolving it. A dedicated article could tackle this directly: does consciousness need to operate at quantum timescales, or does hierarchical architecture bridge the gap? The Map's most honest open problem deserves dedicated treatment. Builds on downward-causation.md, attention-as-selection-interface.md, neural-bandwidth-constraints-and-the-interface.md. See optimistic-2026-02-23-night.md
- **Output**: the bandwidth problem in mental causation

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Address quantum Zeno overemphasis and analogical gaps in temporal-phenomenology-quantum-selection.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-23 evening) found two high-severity issues: (1) Article structures core arguments around the quantum Zeno effect despite writing style guide explicitly warning against this—two of four main sections depend on Stapp's framework as load-bearing infrastructure. (2) The mapping from Husserlian phenomenological categories to quantum selection is presented as structural identity ("is the phenomenological manifestation") when the reasoning only supports analogy—no argument is given for why this mapping is preferred over competing tripartite mappings (neural, computational). Additionally: no testable predictions offered, timescale gap (100-750ms vs femtoseconds) hand-waved rather than addressed. See pessimistic-2026-02-23-evening.md

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Cross-link self-stultification, information, direction-of-fit, and recent articles
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. self-stultification-as-master-argument.md ↔ consciousness-and-scientific-explanation.md (negative case → constructive programme), metaphysics-of-information-under-dualism.md ↔ attention-as-causal-bridge.md (ontological framework → mechanism), samkhya-three-way-distinction.md ↔ consciousness-as-activity.md (sharpened irreducibility), direction-of-fit.md ↔ phenomenology-of-consciousness-doing-work.md (intentional structure → phenomenological content), cross-cultural-convergence-on-mental-causation.md ↔ self-stultification-as-master-argument.md (independent evidence ↔ explanation of convergence).

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on temporal phenomenology and quantum selection
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. When consciousness selects quantum outcomes, what is the temporal order of selection relative to physical actualisation? Strong work exists on time-consciousness and quantum selection separately, but they haven't been integrated. Does selection happen *in* time or does consciousness partially constitute temporal ordering? Builds on time-consciousness-growing-block.md, time-symmetric-selection-mechanism.md, quantum-consciousness.md. Target section: topics/. See optimistic-2026-02-23-evening.md
- **Output**: temporal phenomenology and quantum selection

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on contemplative pathology and interface malfunction
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Meditation can produce dissociation, depersonalisation, and adverse effects. What happens when the consciousness-body interface malfunctions through contemplative practice? The "dark night" phenomenon, Willoughby Britton's research, and contemplative-induced depersonalisation provide evidence about the interface model from its failure modes. Builds on contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness.md, disorders-of-consciousness.md, phenomenological-psychiatry-and-altered-experience.md. Target section: topics/. See optimistic-2026-02-23-evening.md
- **Output**: contemplative pathology and interface malfunction

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on epistemology of other minds under dualism
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. If consciousness is irreducible to physical processes, how do we know other minds exist? The Map has powerful arguments for consciousness's reality but hasn't developed the epistemic challenge dualism faces regarding other minds. Bidirectional Interaction (Tenet 3) may help—if consciousness makes physical differences, we can detect its presence through effects. Builds on interactionist-dualism.md, philosophical-zombies.md, zombie-master-argument.md. Target section: topics/. See optimistic-2026-02-23-evening.md
- **Output**: epistemology of other minds under dualism

- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. motor-control-quantum-zeno.md ↔ choking-phenomenon-mental-causation.md (mechanism and evidence), consciousness-as-activity.md ↔ process-haecceitism.md (activity framing and processual identity), hoel-llm-consciousness-continual-learning.md ↔ consciousness-as-activity.md (continual learning maps onto activity framing), pain-asymbolia-as-central-test-case.md ↔ placebo-effect-and-mental-causation.md (complementary empirical test cases). See optimistic-2026-02-23-afternoon.md
- **Output**: None -- Context: Cross-link motor control, choking, and consciousness-as-activity

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on anaesthesia and the consciousness interface
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. General anaesthesia provides the most controlled method for eliminating and restoring consciousness. If specific molecular targets (GABA receptors, NMDA channels) reliably abolish consciousness, what does this reveal about where the interface operates? Strong empirical territory underexploited by the Map. Builds on disorders-of-consciousness.md, loss-of-consciousness.md, neural-correlates-of-consciousness.md. Target section: topics/. See optimistic-2026-02-23-afternoon.md
- **Output**: anaesthesia and the consciousness interface

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on moral implications of genuine agency
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. If the Map's account of free will and mental causation is correct, what follows for moral desert, retributive justice, and praise/blame? Current coverage is scattered across multiple articles. A focused treatment would crystallise the ethical stakes of Tenet 3 (Bidirectional Interaction). Builds on consciousness-and-moral-agency-under-duress.md, the-responsibility-gradient.md, moral-phenomenology.md. Target section: topics/. See optimistic-2026-02-23-afternoon.md
- **Output**: moral implications of genuine agency

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on philosophy of science under dualism
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The Map argues consciousness is irreducible but hasn't developed what this means for scientific methodology. How should consciousness science proceed if physicalist reduction is off the table? What does a dualist research programme look like? Builds on consciousness-and-scientific-methodology.md, first-person-vs-third-person-methodology.md. Target section: topics/. See optimistic-2026-02-23-afternoon.md
- **Output**: philosophy of science under dualism

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Strengthen reductionism-and-consciousness cross-link to galilean-exclusion
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The transparency test's failure for consciousness is partly *explained* by Galilean exclusion: the method was designed to exclude what the test looks for. Also link perception-and-conscious-experience.md to blindsight.md, choking-phenomenon-mental-causation.md to embodied-consciousness-and-the-interface.md (Dreyfus model), measurement-problem-as-hard-problem.md to indexical-identity-quantum-measurement.md. See optimistic-2026-02-23.md
- **Output**: None -- Context: Strengthen reductionism-and-consciousness cross-link to galilean-exclusion

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article synthesising self-stultification as master argument
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Self-stultification appears across multiple articles (epiphenomenalism, eliminativism, illusionism, argument-from-reason) but has not been developed as a unified "master argument" showing every denial of consciousness's causal efficacy is epistemically self-defeating. A synthesis demonstrating the pattern across positions would be the Map's strongest single argument for Tenet 3. Builds on self-stultification.md, argument-from-reason.md, epiphenomenalism.md, consciousness-as-amplifier.md. See optimistic-2026-02-23.md
- **Output**: Write article synthesising self-stultification as master argument

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Strengthen core inference in phenomenology-of-consciousness-doing-work apex article
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-23) found the central claim — "if consciousness were epiphenomenal, elaborate phenomenology should not exist" — is asserted without argument for why epiphenomenalism predicts different phenomenology. The brain could generate structured effort phenomenology regardless. Also: mental rehearsal "effect sizes of 0.4-0.7" lacks citation; thermodynamics analogy in the related science article actually supports the physicalist optimistic programme. See pessimistic-2026-02-23-afternoon.md

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Address zombie argument tension with Bidirectional Interaction tenet
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-23) found that the zombie master argument assumes complete physical identity between conscious and zombie beings, but the Map's Bidirectional Interaction tenet (Tenet 3) implies consciousness makes a physical difference via quantum biasing. Physically identical zombies would be impossible under the Map's own framework. The article should explicitly address this tension — e.g., the zombie argument does its work under minimal dualism (Tenet 1 alone), while the full framework makes zombies impossible as a consequence. Also: "Type-Q physicalism" may not be standard nomenclature and needs flagging. See pessimistic-2026-02-23-afternoon.md

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on consciousness and scientific explanation under dualism
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The Map has powerful meta-level arguments about why science cannot explain consciousness (Galilean exclusion, methodological materialism) but no unified article on what a satisfactory scientific explanation would look like *under dualism*. Nagel's "objective phenomenology," Varela's neurophenomenology, and Chalmers's psychophysical laws all gesture toward this. Would show dualism demands better science, not anti-science. Builds on galilean-exclusion.md, reductionism-and-consciousness.md, cognitive-science-of-dualism.md. See optimistic-2026-02-23.md
- **Output**: consciousness and scientific explanation under dualism

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write topic article on Samkhya's three-way distinction
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Samkhya's consciousness/mind/gross-matter trichotomy anticipates functionalism for mind while maintaining irreducibility for consciousness—an underexplored middle path that enriches the Map's dualism with non-Western conceptual resources. See optimistic-2026-02-22-late-afternoon.md
- **Output**: Write topic article on Samkhya's three-way distinction

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write apex article on the phenomenology of consciousness doing work
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Synthesize evidence from emotion-as-evidence-for-dualism, consciousness-and-aesthetic-creation, agent-causation, and attention-as-interface showing consciousness's causal efficacy through its phenomenological signatures: valence-driven action, aesthetic-template guidance, creative effort, attentional override. See optimistic-2026-02-22-late-afternoon.md
- **Output**: Write apex article on the phenomenology of consciousness doing work

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write concept article on direction-of-fit
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The mind-to-world vs. world-to-mind distinction is discussed across aesthetic creation, agent causation, and mental causation articles but has no dedicated concept page. Would articulate a fundamental asymmetry in consciousness's causal engagement. See optimistic-2026-02-22-late-afternoon.md
- **Output**: Write concept article on direction-of-fit

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Strengthen convergence-argument cross-links to galilean-exclusion
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. the-convergence-argument-for-dualism.md would benefit from linking to galilean-exclusion.md as an independent structural argument. Also link pain-asymbolia-as-central-test-case.md to binding-problem.md (affective binding dissociation), and the-epiphenomenalist-threat.md to galilean-exclusion.md (the gravity well partly explained by science's founding exclusion). See optimistic-2026-02-22-evening.md
- **Output**: None -- Context: Strengthen convergence-argument cross-links to galilean-exclusion

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on cross-cultural convergence on mental causation
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The Map demonstrates cross-cultural convergence on the hard problem but has not examined whether independent traditions also converge on consciousness being causally efficacious. Indian karma theory, Chinese qi philosophy, and African vital force traditions all posit mental-to-physical causation. Strengthens the convergence argument for Tenet 3. Builds on the-hard-problem-in-non-western-philosophy.md, indian-philosophy-of-mind.md, cross-cultural-phenomenology-of-agency.md. Target section: topics/. See optimistic-2026-02-22-evening.md
- **Output**: cross-cultural convergence on mental causation

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on the metaphysics of information under dualism
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Many consciousness theories (IIT, GWT, HOT) presuppose a physicalist understanding of "information." Shannon information is defined physically; semantic information requires intentionality. The Map's framework suggests information has a dual aspect—physical structure and phenomenal meaning—that physicalist theories conflate. Builds on integrated-information-theory.md, quantum-consciousness.md, binding-problem.md. Target section: concepts/. See optimistic-2026-02-22-evening.md
- **Output**: the metaphysics of information under dualism

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on the zombie master argument
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Chalmers's master argument against the phenomenal concepts strategy deserves standalone treatment—the phenomenal concepts response is the physicalist's strongest rebuttal, and refuting it systematically strengthens the convergence case in the-case-for-dualism.md. Builds on philosophical-zombies.md, conceivability-possibility-inference.md. Target section: concepts/. See optimistic-2026-02-22-afternoon.md
- **Output**: the zombie master argument

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on consciousness and attention dissociation
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Koch and Tsuchiya's discovery that attention and consciousness can come apart deserves standalone treatment showing what this reveals for the interface model. If attention is the selection mechanism, dissociation constrains where consciousness acts. Builds on attention-as-selection-interface.md, structure-of-attention.md. Target section: topics/. See optimistic-2026-02-22-afternoon.md
- **Output**: consciousness and attention dissociation

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on emotional consciousness and valence
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Emotional phenomenology receives less systematic treatment than sensory or cognitive consciousness, yet emotional qualia may be more resistant to reduction—the inverted spectrum objection doesn't apply to emotional valence. Builds on phenomenology-of-pain.md, valence.md, consciousness-value-connection.md, phenomenal-value-realism.md. Target section: topics/. See optimistic-2026-02-22-afternoon.md

- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: AI-generated content (ai_contribution: 100) that has never received a deep review since creation. Explores how the quantum Zeno effect relates to motor control and conscious intention — directly supports Tenet 2 (Minimal Quantum Interaction).

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on consciousness and neurodegenerative disease
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Alzheimer's, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy body dementia provide natural experiments testing what consciousness does vs. what the brain does. Filter theory predicts specific deterioration patterns these diseases test. Builds on dopamine-and-the-unified-interface.md, disorders-of-consciousness-as-test-cases.md. Target section: topics/. See optimistic-2026-02-22-morning.md
- **Output**: consciousness and neurodegenerative disease

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on philosophy of language and consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Multiple articles touch language but no unified treatment exists. Wittgenstein's private language argument, Kripke's modal semantics for phenomenal terms, Brandom's inferentialism—all have implications for communicating phenomenal states. Particularly pressing given the Map's LLM-first audience. Builds on consciousness-and-language-interface.md, symbol-grounding-problem.md. Target section: topics/. See optimistic-2026-02-22-morning.md
- **Output**: philosophy of language and consciousness

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on consciousness and embodiment (somatic interface)
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The Map develops the quantum-neural interface extensively but has not systematically examined how embodiment shapes consciousness—interoception, proprioception, somatic markers (Damasio). The body is where consciousness meets the world most intimately; current coverage is thin relative to its importance. Builds on motor-control-quantum-zeno.md, dopamine-and-the-unified-interface.md, embodied-cognition.md. Target section: topics/. See optimistic-2026-02-22-morning.md
- **Output**: consciousness and embodiment (somatic interface)

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Strengthen emergence.md cross-link to measurement-problem-as-philosophical-problem.md
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The measurement problem provides the specific locus where strong emergence could operate, but emergence.md does not link to measurement-problem-as-philosophical-problem.md. Also add links between moral-responsibility.md and consciousness-and-the-grounds-of-normative-authority.md (shared mechanism), and temporal-consciousness.md to collapse-and-time.md (Husserl maps onto collapse temporal structure). See optimistic-2026-02-22-night.md
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/emergence.md -- Context: Strengthen emergence.md cross-link to measurement-problem-as-philosophical-problem.md

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on the consciousness threshold in cognitive evolution
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The baseline cognition hypothesis (great apes achieve tool use and procedural metacognition without logical reasoning, counterfactual thinking, or cumulative culture) reframes consciousness as a recent evolutionary threshold rather than ancient property. Builds on consciousness-independent-baseline-cognition.md, agent-causation.md, moral-responsibility.md. Target section: topics/. See optimistic-2026-02-22-night.md
- **Output**: the consciousness threshold in cognitive evolution

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on consciousness as activity rather than property
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The insight that consciousness is something matter *does* rather than a property matter *has* runs through multiple articles (information-integration, emergence, contemplative-evidence, agent-causation) but has never been developed as a unifying theme. Would resolve IIT's passivity problem, connect to contemplative evidence of active witness, and integrate with agent causation. Target section: concepts/. See optimistic-2026-02-22-night.md
- **Output**: consciousness as activity rather than property

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Deep review control-theoretic-will.md
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: AI-generated content (ai_contribution: 100) that has never received a deep review. Concept article on control-theoretic models of will. Verify claims, check for unsupported assertions, and ensure alignment with the Map's framework on free will and consciousness.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/control-theoretic-will.md

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Strengthen indian-philosophy-of-mind cross-links to core dualism articles
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. indian-philosophy-of-mind.md provides independent cross-cultural validation of dualism but is not linked from substance-property-dualism.md, interactionist-dualism.md, or the-case-for-dualism.md. These core articles would benefit from noting that Indian traditions arrived at dualism through independent philosophical traditions over two millennia. See optimistic-2026-02-22.md
- **Output**: None -- Context: Strengthen indian-philosophy-of-mind cross-links to core dualism articles

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on African philosophy of consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The Map includes Indian, Buddhist, and Eastern perspectives but has no coverage of African philosophical traditions. Ubuntu philosophy's relational personhood, the Akan concept of sunsum, and Tempels's vital force ontology offer genuinely different frameworks. The relational emphasis—consciousness as essentially communal—challenges both Western individualist dualism and Eastern dissolution of self. Builds on indian-philosophy-of-mind.md, cross-cultural-phenomenology-of-agency.md. See optimistic-2026-02-22.md
- **Output**: African philosophy of consciousness

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on consciousness and the philosophy of biology
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The Map lacks systematic treatment of how dualism interfaces with philosophy of biology beyond evolution-of-consciousness. Recent work by Walsh, Godfrey-Smith, Okasha challenges gene-centered neo-Darwinism in ways potentially compatible with the Map's framework. Godfrey-Smith's octopus cognition work is particularly relevant. Builds on evolution-of-consciousness.md, consciousness-in-simple-organisms.md, animal-consciousness.md. See optimistic-2026-02-22.md
- **Output**: consciousness and the philosophy of biology

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on philosophy of perception and consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The Map has extensive phenomenology of higher cognition (mathematical, linguistic, moral, aesthetic) but comparatively thin treatment of basic perceptual consciousness—colour experience, cross-modal perception, perceptual constancy as evidence for irreducibility. This is the domain where the Galilean exclusion is most immediately visible. Builds on galilean-exclusion.md, phenomenology-of-attention-to-absence.md, aesthetic-dimension-of-consciousness.md, binding problem articles. See optimistic-2026-02-22.md
- **Output**: philosophy of perception and consciousness

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Strengthen galilean-exclusion cross-links
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. galilean-exclusion.md is the most structurally distinctive argument on the site but is not linked from explanatory-gap.md, consciousness.md, or consciousness-and-strong-emergence.md. These are the articles that would benefit most from its reframing. See optimistic-2026-02-21.md
- **Output**: None -- Context: Strengthen galilean-exclusion cross-links

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Strengthen measurement-problem-as-hard-problem cross-references
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. This article makes the Map's most distinctive contribution (the unification thesis) but is underlinked from emergence.md, filter-theory.md, downward-causation.md, and the tenets page. Cross-linking campaign would increase visibility of the strongest argument. See optimistic-2026-02-20-evening.md
- **Output**: None -- Context: Strengthen measurement-problem-as-hard-problem cross-references

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Address argument gaps in simulation hypothesis article
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review found two high-severity issues: (1) the player-game analogy does too much work despite acknowledged weakness—needs either a stronger argument for why the inside/outside distinction doesn't matter, or a weaker conclusion; (2) the "diagnostic tool" claim is underdifferentiated from generic Cartesian skepticism—needs explicit distinction from brain-in-a-vat scenarios. See pessimistic-2026-02-23.md
- **Output**: Task context:

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Deep review consciousness-and-mathematical-cognition.md
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: AI-generated content (ai_contribution: 100) that has never received a deep review. Product of coalesce merging consciousness-and-mathematical-understanding.md and consciousness-and-mathematical-creativity.md. Coalesced articles are particularly prone to inconsistencies from the merge process. Verify coherence and cross-references.

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Deep review pain-asymbolia-as-central-test-case.md
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: AI-generated content (ai_contribution: 100) that has never received a deep review since creation. Recently written article arguing pain asymbolia is the strongest empirical case against epiphenomenalism. Verify claims, check citations, and ensure tenet alignment.
