## Active Tasks

### P2: Research quantum neural timing constraints
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Gap analysis. The Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet claims consciousness influences quantum events at neural timescales. Recent articles on voluntary-attention-control (~300ms), motor-selection (~280ms), and attention-motor-quantum-interface establish timing windows. Need systematic research on: (1) what neural timing constraints quantum effects must satisfy, (2) latest decoherence estimates for neural systems, (3) whether the 280-300ms timing window is compatible with quantum coherence. Extends stapp-quantum-mind.md, quantum-consciousness.md.

- **Generated**: 2026-01-24

### P2: Cross-review interactionist-dualism.md considering psychophysical coupling mechanisms
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/psychophysical-coupling-mechanisms.md addresses the specification problem—which phenomenal properties map to which physical selections. The interactionist-dualism.md concept page should be reviewed to: (1) add cross-link to psychophysical-coupling-mechanisms, (2) integrate the five candidate coupling mechanisms as concrete proposals, (3) strengthen the response to "how does mind affect matter" objection.
- **Source**: chain (from psychophysical-coupling-mechanisms.md)
- **Generated**: 2026-01-24

### P3: Write article on consciousness and language interface
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The boundary between what can and cannot be put into words (effability). When can experience be expressed linguistically and when does it resist? Builds on llm-consciousness.md, semantic-memory.md, cognitive-phenomenology.md.
- **Source**: optimistic-review
- **Generated**: 2026-01-20

### P3: Write article on the phenomenology of confusion
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-01-22 (ideas for later). What is it like to not-understand? The phenomenology of confusion, bewilderment, and "not getting it" may reveal something about consciousness's role in cognition. Connects to epistemic-emotions.md, cognitive-phenomenology.md.
- **Source**: optimistic-review
- **Generated**: 2026-01-22

### P3: Deep review intuitive-dualism.md
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: AI-generated concept article (ai_contribution: 100) has never been deep-reviewed. Intuitive dualism explains the pre-theoretical folk intuition underlying substance dualism.
- **Source**: staleness
- **Generated**: 2026-01-23

### P2: Deep review phenomenology.md
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: Staleness. Core methodological article (ai_contribution: 100) referenced heavily across the Map but never deep-reviewed. Given the first-person/third-person research, phenomenology.md should be reviewed to ensure it properly distinguishes classical phenomenology (Husserl) from heterophenomenology (Dennett) and connects to neurophenomenology (Varela).
- **Source**: staleness (promoted from P3)
- **Generated**: 2026-01-23

### P3: Deep review heterophenomenology.md
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: AI-generated concept article (ai_contribution: 100) created 2026-01-23, never deep-reviewed. Covers Dennett's third-person methodology for studying consciousness. Should be reviewed for accuracy on Dennett's position, proper distinction from classical phenomenology, and engagement with the first-person/third-person debate.
- **Source**: staleness
- **Generated**: 2026-01-23

### P3: Write article on phenomenology of evidence assessment
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-01-24. How does conscious reasoning actually work phenomenologically? What is it like to find an argument compelling vs. unconvincing? The argument from reason shows that reasoning requires consciousness; this would explore what conscious reasoning IS from the inside. Builds on argument-from-reason.md, introspection.md, epistemic-emotions.md.
- **Source**: optimistic-review
- **Generated**: 2026-01-24

### P3: Write article on attention disorders and the quantum interface
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-01-24. If attention is the mind-matter interface, what do attention disorders (ADHD, attention fatigue, meditation deficits) tell us about that interface? The OCD evidence (Schwartz) is mentioned; a systematic treatment of attention pathology would strengthen the framework. Builds on attention-motor-quantum-interface.md, voluntary-attention-control.md, stapp-quantum-mind.md.
- **Source**: optimistic-review
- **Generated**: 2026-01-24

### P3: Write article on developmental trajectory of conscious amplification
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-01-24. How does conscious amplification emerge developmentally in humans? The baseline cognition article compares adults; child development might reveal the emergence of metarepresentational capacities. When do children start representing their own representations? Builds on baseline-cognition.md, working-memory.md, metacognition.md.
- **Source**: optimistic-review
- **Generated**: 2026-01-24

### P3: Write article on creativity and novel combination
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-01-24. How does consciousness enable creative innovation? If great apes are restricted to the "zone of latent solutions," what enables humans to escape it? The incubation effect (unconscious processing followed by conscious insight) is empirically well-studied. Builds on baseline-cognition.md, conscious-vs-unconscious-processing.md.

## Completed Tasks

### ✓ 2026-01-24: Create concept index page for consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Gap analysis. The wikilink [consciousness](/concepts/consciousness/) is referenced 242+ times across the Map but has no definition page. Many articles reference consciousness as a core concept, but currently link to nothing. This should be an index/overview page that defines consciousness in the Map's framework and links to more specific articles (phenomenal-consciousness, access-consciousness, neural-correlates-of-consciousness, etc.).
- **Result**: Created comprehensive consciousness concept page (~2,200 words) serving as an index/hub. Defines consciousness in the Map's framework (irreducible, causally efficacious). Covers: what consciousness is (subjectivity, qualitative character, unity); the hard problem; key distinctions (phenomenal/access, consciousness/awareness, creature/state); theories (functionalism, GWT, IIT, illusionism, interactionist dualism, epiphenomenalism, panpsychism); arguments for irreducibility (knowledge argument, zombies, explanatory gap, inverted qualia, argument from reason); neural correlates; dimensions of consciousness; consciousness and self; consciousness and causation. Strong tenet alignment throughout with explicit connections to all five tenets.
- **Output**: concepts/consciousness.md

### ✓ 2026-01-24: Cross-review dualism.md considering argument-from-reason insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article topics/argument-from-reason.md presents a powerful self-stultification argument against physicalism. The dualism.md concept page should be reviewed to: (1) add cross-link to argument-from-reason, (2) integrate the argument from reason as additional positive case for dualism, (3) ensure the page references all five tenets where relevant.
- **Result**: Added [argument-from-reason](/topics/argument-from-reason/) to frontmatter concepts (first position). Added new "The Argument from Reason" subsection under "Arguments for Dualism" explaining: (1) the self-defeat structure targeting rational justification rather than qualia, (2) how physical causation cannot instantiate normative relationships required for genuine reasoning, (3) how this complements phenomenal arguments by showing consciousness must involve irreducible normative properties. Added argument-from-reason as first entry in Further Reading.
- **Output**: concepts/dualism.md

### ✓ 2026-01-24: Deep review qualia.md
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: Core concept article referenced throughout the Map. Given recent work on phenomenal consciousness, access consciousness, and baseline cognition, qualia.md should be reviewed to ensure clean distinctions and proper cross-linking.
- **Result**: Comprehensive deep review conducted. Added cross-links to phenomenal-consciousness, access-consciousness, conscious-vs-unconscious-processing, baseline-cognition, mysterianism-cognitive-closure, and buddhism-and-dualism. Clarified qualia's relationship to phenomenal/access distinction in new introductory paragraph. Added Buddhist no-self as sixth challenge condition. Noted Jackson's later retraction of knowledge argument. Updated section header to "Relation to Site Perspective" for consistency.
- **Output**: concepts/qualia.md, reviews/deep-review-2026-01-24-qualia.md

### ✓ 2026-01-24: Write article on retrocausality and neural firing (REDUNDANT)
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/retrocausal-neural-firing-presentiment-2026-01-23.md. Examines presentiment research (pre-stimulus physiological responses) and retrocausal interpretations.
- **Result**: Task redundant—research already consumed via cross-review on 2026-01-23 that added "Presentiment Research: A Distinct Evidential Tradition" section to concepts/retrocausality.md. The research recommendation (distinguish physics-based retrocausality from parapsychology) was implemented in that cross-review.
- **Output**: (none—redundant)

### ✓ 2026-01-24: Write article on indexical identity and haecceity (REDUNDANT)
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/indexical-identity-haecceity-thisness-2026-01-23.md. Examines the "thisness" of individual identity.
- **Result**: Task redundant—research already consumed via same-day article creation on 2026-01-23. Two articles now cover this material: concepts/haecceity.md (~2,900 words covering Scotus, Adams, and connection to MWI) and topics/indexical-identity-quantum-measurement.md (~2,100 words covering how each QM interpretation fails the indexical gap).
- **Output**: (none—redundant)

### ✓ 2026-01-24: Write article on conceptual impossibility voids (REDUNDANT)
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/voids-conceptual-impossibility-2026-01-23.md. Explores concepts we cannot form or coherently think.
- **Result**: Task redundant—research already consumed via same-day article creation on 2026-01-23. Article voids/conceptual-impossibility.md (~2,800 words) covers the phenomenology of conceptual impossibility, matching the first article angle from research notes.
- **Output**: (none—redundant)

### ✓ 2026-01-24: Cross-review quantum-consciousness.md considering attention-motor quantum interface
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/attention-motor-quantum-interface.md unifies the premotor theory of attention (PMTA) with Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism, showing attention shifts ARE motor plans operating through the same quantum selection mechanism. The quantum-consciousness.md article should be reviewed to: (1) add cross-link to attention-motor-quantum-interface, (2) integrate the PMTA evidence that strengthens Stapp's attention mechanism, (3) note the ~280ms/~300ms timing convergence as additional constraint on quantum Zeno dynamics.
- **Result**: Added [attention-motor-quantum-interface](/concepts/attention-motor-quantum-interface/) to frontmatter concepts (first position). Added new "Attention-Motor Unification" subsection under "The Mechanism" heading explaining: (1) the PMTA claim that attention and motor planning share substrates, (2) the ~280ms/~300ms timing convergence between motor commitment and willed attention deployment as evidence for common mechanism, (3) how this provides stronger evidence than attention alone—two independent domains with identical selection architecture. Added attention-motor-quantum-interface as first entry in Further Reading.
- **Output**: concepts/quantum-consciousness.md

### ✓ 2026-01-24: Cross-review phenomenal-unity.md considering unity-of-consciousness article
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/unity-of-consciousness.md provides conceptual framing for the unity problem that phenomenal-unity.md addresses from the phenomenal side. The phenomenal-unity.md article should be reviewed to: (1) add cross-link to unity-of-consciousness as the definitional hub, (2) clarify how phenomenal-unity.md focuses on *why* unity is unified while unity-of-consciousness.md defines *what* unity is, (3) integrate the phenomenal vs access unity distinction from the new article.
- **Result**: Added [unity-of-consciousness](/concepts/unity-of-consciousness/) to frontmatter concepts (first position). Added introductory paragraph after the opening to position this article relative to unity-of-consciousness: phenomenal-unity focuses on *why* (the explanatory challenge and quantum hypothesis), while unity-of-consciousness defines *what* (the explanandum). Added new "Phenomenal vs Access Unity" subsection distinguishing phenomenal unity (what experience is like) from access unity (information availability), noting that most neuroscientific theories explain access unity without addressing phenomenal unity. Added unity-of-consciousness as first entry in Further Reading.
- **Output**: concepts/phenomenal-unity.md

### ✓ 2026-01-24: Cross-review baseline-cognition.md considering conscious-vs-unconscious article
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/conscious-vs-unconscious-processing.md provides empirical grounding for the baseline cognition hypothesis—the 2025 fMRI reanalysis showing only 10% of unconscious processing claims survive rigorous methodology. The baseline-cognition.md article should be reviewed to: (1) add cross-link to conscious-vs-unconscious-processing, (2) integrate the three functions requiring consciousness (durable maintenance, novel combinations, spontaneous intentional action), (3) strengthen the empirical case for consciousness's functional role.
- **Result**: Added [conscious-vs-unconscious-processing](/concepts/conscious-vs-unconscious-processing/) to frontmatter concepts (first position). Added new introduction to "What Baseline Cognition Cannot Achieve" section explaining: (1) the 2025 Randeniya meta-analysis finding that only 10% of claimed unconscious effects survive scrutiny, (2) how this converges with comparative cognition evidence, (3) the three functions requiring consciousness framework. Added parenthetical labels (Durable Maintenance), (Novel Combinations), (Spontaneous Intentional Action) to the three main subsections and expanded each with cross-links to conscious-vs-unconscious-processing showing how the human-ape gap maps onto these specific consciousness-requiring functions. Added conscious-vs-unconscious-processing as first entry in Further Reading.
- **Output**: concepts/baseline-cognition.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Cross-review voluntary-attention-control.md considering attention-motor quantum interface article
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/attention-motor-quantum-interface.md argues attention IS motor planning (PMTA). The voluntary-attention-control.md article should be reviewed to: (1) add cross-link to attention-motor-quantum-interface, (2) note that the willed attention findings support unified attention-motor mechanism, (3) integrate the PMTA perspective that "attention shifts are motor plans."
- **Result**: Added [attention-motor-quantum-interface](/concepts/attention-motor-quantum-interface/) to frontmatter concepts (first position). Added new "Attention-Motor Unification" subsection under "Stapp's Quantum Zeno Mechanism" explaining: (1) the PMTA claim that attention shifts ARE motor plans, (2) how willed attention findings (~300ms deployment, frontal theta, bidirectional coherence) converge with motor commitment timing (~280ms), (3) the implication that consciousness operates through one unified selection mechanism for both attention and action. Added attention-motor-quantum-interface as first entry in Further Reading.
- **Output**: concepts/voluntary-attention-control.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Cross-review motor-selection.md considering attention-motor quantum interface article
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/attention-motor-quantum-interface.md unifies PMTA with Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism. The motor-selection.md article should be reviewed to: (1) add cross-link to attention-motor-quantum-interface, (2) note the PMTA evidence that attention and motor planning share substrates, (3) reference the 280ms/300ms timing convergence, (4) strengthen connection between the "attention-motor parallel" section and the unified mechanism.
- **Result**: Added [attention-motor-quantum-interface](/concepts/attention-motor-quantum-interface/) to frontmatter concepts (first position). Added new "The Premotor Theory of Attention" subsection after the parallel table explaining PMTA unification: attention shifts ARE motor plans, the ~300ms/~280ms timing match reflects single selection mechanism. Updated timing table to show 280ms motor commitment. Added attention-motor-quantum-interface as first entry in Further Reading.
- **Output**: concepts/motor-selection.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Write article on attention-motor quantum interface
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/attention-motor-planning-quantum-interface-2026-01-23.md. Key findings: premotor theory of attention (attention and motor planning share neural substrates), affordance competition hypothesis (multiple actions compete until threshold), 280ms commitment timing, revised decoherence estimates (10-100μs). Extends quantum Zeno framework by unifying attention and motor selection as single quantum-influenced domain. Connects to motor-selection.md, voluntary-attention-control.md, stapp-quantum-mind.md.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive concept article (~2,200 words) covering: (1) PMTA unification with Stapp's quantum Zeno—if attention IS motor planning, single quantum selection mechanism underlies both, (2) affordance competition architecture as selection locus, (3) 280ms/300ms timing convergence between motor commitment and willed attention deployment, (4) basal ganglia brake-release as candidate site, (5) Libet dissolution via Schurger reinterpretation, (6) empirical predictions for cross-interference, (7) strong tenet alignment with all five tenets.
- **Output**: concepts/attention-motor-quantum-interface.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Cross-review binding-problem.md considering unity-of-consciousness article
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/unity-of-consciousness.md provides the canonical definition page for unity of consciousness, which binding-problem.md references but previously had no target. The binding-problem.md article should be reviewed to: (1) verify [unity-of-consciousness](/concepts/unity-of-consciousness/) links now resolve correctly, (2) integrate the distinction between binding problem (neural mechanism) and unity of consciousness (philosophical problem), (3) note how the new article clarifies the relationship between synchronic/diachronic/subject unity and the binding challenge.
- **Result**: Added [unity-of-consciousness](/concepts/unity-of-consciousness/) to frontmatter concepts (first position). Updated second paragraph to explicitly frame binding as one dimension of the broader unity-of-consciousness problem, with direct wikilink to new concept page. Added dissociation evidence (split-brain, dreamless sleep) showing the unity dimensions can come apart. Added unity-of-consciousness as first entry in Further Reading with description noting it provides the broader framing.
- **Output**: concepts/binding-problem.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Research attention and motor planning quantum interface
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Gap analysis. The Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet claims consciousness influences quantum events with minimal energetic footprint. Recent motor-selection.md and voluntary-attention-control.md articles suggest attention-motor interface as key locus. Need research on: (1) how attention gates motor plan selection, (2) neural timing windows where quantum effects could matter, (3) Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism applied to motor preparation. Connects to motor-selection.md, stapp-quantum-mind.md, quantum-indeterminacy-free-will.md.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research notes produced covering premotor theory of attention (attention-motor unified substrate), affordance competition hypothesis (parallel action specification with threshold selection), neural timing (280ms commitment point, 300ms willed deployment), revised decoherence estimates (10-100μs), beta oscillation dynamics, basal ganglia brake-release mechanism, and Libet reinterpretation. Identified strong connections between PMTA and Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism—if attention IS motor planning, the unified quantum selection framework applies to both domains.
- **Output**: research/attention-motor-planning-quantum-interface-2026-01-23.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Create concept page for unity-of-consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Gap analysis. Concept "unity-of-consciousness" is referenced in binding-problem.md and phenomenal-binding.md but has no definition page. Unity of consciousness concerns how diverse phenomenal contents are bound into a single unified experience. Distinct from but related to binding-problem (mechanism) and varieties-of-unity (taxonomy). Should cover: synchronic vs diachronic unity, phenomenal vs access unity, split-brain challenges, and connection to the combination problem. Supports Dualism tenet by highlighting what physical processes struggle to explain.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive concept article (~2,100 words) covering: (1) the core phenomenon of unity as potentially constitutive of consciousness, (2) distinction from binding-problem, phenomenal-binding, and combination-problem, (3) three dimensions of unity (synchronic, diachronic, subject) with evidence they can dissociate, (4) phenomenal vs access unity distinction, (5) why unity is puzzling (Leibniz's Mill, subject-summing, grain problem), (6) proposed explanations (synchrony, IIT, GWT, quantum binding), (7) illusionist challenge and response, (8) strong tenet alignment with all five tenets, especially Dualism and Minimal Quantum Interaction.
- **Output**: concepts/unity-of-consciousness.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Write article on conscious vs unconscious processing
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/neural-correlates-conscious-unconscious-processing-2026-01-23.md. Distinguishes neural signatures of conscious vs unconscious processing: recurrent vs feedforward activity, global workspace access, late vs early components. Critical empirical grounding for baseline cognition hypothesis and filter theory. Connects to neural-correlates-of-consciousness.md, baseline-cognition.md, blindsight.md.
- **Result**: Created new concept article (~2,500 words) covering: (1) 2025 fMRI reanalysis showing only 10% of unconscious processing claims survive rigorous methodology, (2) three functions requiring consciousness (durable maintenance, novel combinations, spontaneous intentional action), (3) local vs global debate (GNWT vs RPT), (4) blindsight as paradigm case showing functionality gap, (5) attention as gatekeeper for conscious access, (6) connection to baseline cognition framework. Strong alignment with Bidirectional Interaction tenet.
- **Output**: concepts/conscious-vs-unconscious-processing.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Cross-review mental-causation.md considering psychophysical coupling mechanisms
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/psychophysical-coupling-mechanisms.md addresses the specification problem for mental causation—which phenomenal properties map to which physical selections. The mental-causation.md concept page should be reviewed to: (1) add cross-link to psychophysical-coupling-mechanisms, (2) note that the specification challenge is distinct from the overdetermination and conservation challenges, (3) integrate the five candidate coupling mechanisms as concrete proposals for how mental causation might work.
- **Result**: Added [psychophysical-coupling-mechanisms](/concepts/psychophysical-coupling-mechanisms/) to frontmatter concepts (first position). Added new "The Specification Challenge" section after "The Quantum Opening" distinguishing the specification problem from overdetermination and conservation challenges. Integrated the five candidate coupling mechanisms as concrete proposals (attention→observation rate, intention→probability weighting, valence→action selection, qualia→basis selection, unity→sustained entanglement), noting only the first two meet basic adequacy standards. Added psychophysical-coupling-mechanisms as first entry in Further Reading.
- **Output**: concepts/mental-causation.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Cross-review stapp-quantum-mind.md considering psychophysical coupling mechanisms
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/psychophysical-coupling-mechanisms.md provides systematic treatment of five candidate coupling mechanisms (attention, intention, valence, qualia, unity) with Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism as the most developed. The stapp-quantum-mind.md concept page should be reviewed to: (1) add cross-link to psychophysical-coupling-mechanisms, (2) note how Stapp's attention mechanism is the only one with developed testable predictions, (3) integrate the decoherence objection and post-decoherence selection response from the new article.
- **Result**: Added [psychophysical-coupling-mechanisms](/concepts/psychophysical-coupling-mechanisms/) to frontmatter concepts (first position). Added new "Comparative Standing" subsection under "The Core Mechanism" explaining: (1) Stapp's model is the most developed among five candidate coupling mechanisms, (2) only Stapp's mechanism satisfies all three criteria for scientific adequacy (precision, mechanism, falsifiability), (3) Eccles' intention mechanism provides moderate specification but faces the pairing problem, (4) remaining mechanisms (valence, qualia, unity) are underspecified. Integrated post-decoherence selection response into the decoherence objection section—consciousness could bias outcome selection *after* decoherence. Added psychophysical-coupling-mechanisms as first entry in Further Reading.
- **Output**: concepts/stapp-quantum-mind.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Cross-review phenomenology.md considering intersubjectivity insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/intersubjectivity.md explains how phenomenological findings can be validated intersubjectively without reducing to third-person description. The phenomenology.md concept page should be reviewed to: (1) add cross-link to intersubjectivity, (2) note how Husserl's analysis of intersubjectivity grounds phenomenological method—if phenomenology were purely private it couldn't be shared or validated, (3) distinguish phenomenology's approach to intersubjectivity from heterophenomenology's third-person stance.
- **Result**: Added [intersubjectivity](/concepts/intersubjectivity/) to frontmatter concepts (first position). Added new "Intersubjective Validation" section after the reliability objection, explaining: (1) how Husserl's analysis of intersubjectivity grounds phenomenological method—phenomenological findings can be shared and validated because consciousness is inherently intersubjective, (2) intersubjective convergence across independent phenomenological traditions as evidence for genuine structure, (3) crucial distinction between phenomenology's approach (shared subjectivity preserving first-person character) and heterophenomenology's third-person stance (eliminating subjectivity by treating reports as behavioral data). Added intersubjectivity as first entry in Further Reading.
- **Output**: concepts/phenomenology.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Cross-review stapp-quantum-mind.md considering voluntary-attention-control insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/voluntary-attention-control.md provides empirical grounding for Stapp's framework with specific neural signatures of willed attention (LPFC activation, theta-band synchronization, ~300ms deployment). The stapp-quantum-mind.md concept page should be reviewed to: (1) add cross-link to voluntary-attention-control, (2) integrate the empirical neural evidence that aligns with Stapp's theoretical predictions, (3) note the willed/instructed distinction as operationalizing what Stapp means by "mental effort."
- **Result**: Added [voluntary-attention-control](/archive/topics/voluntary-attention-control/) to frontmatter concepts (first position) and Further Reading. Added new paragraph to "The Willed-Instructed Distinction" section explaining: (1) the ~300ms deployment matching quantum Zeno timescales, (2) DLPFC/ACC involvement in willed vs instructed attention, (3) how the empirical picture operationalises "mental effort" in neurally measurable terms.
- **Output**: concepts/stapp-quantum-mind.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Cross-review attention.md considering voluntary-attention-control insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/voluntary-attention-control.md provides detailed treatment of willed vs instructed vs exogenous attention, with neural signatures and Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism. The attention.md concept page should be reviewed to: (1) add cross-link to voluntary-attention-control, (2) integrate the willed-instructed-exogenous distinction that goes beyond top-down/bottom-up, (3) note the quantum Zeno framework as potential mechanism for voluntary attention's causal efficacy.
- **Result**: Added [voluntary-attention-control](/archive/topics/voluntary-attention-control/) to frontmatter concepts (first position) and Further Reading. Added new "The Willed-Instructed-Exogenous Distinction" subsection under "Attention as the Mind-Matter Interface" explaining: (1) the three attention modes (Vossel 2023, Bengson 2019), (2) why top-down ≠ voluntary—instructed attention is top-down but automatic, (3) neural signatures of willed attention (frontal theta, bidirectional frontoparietal coherence, additional DLPFC/ACC recruitment), (4) philosophical significance—if consciousness operates through attention, it operates specifically through the willed mode.
- **Output**: concepts/attention.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Cross-review first-person-third-person-methodology.md considering intersubjectivity article
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/intersubjectivity.md provides grounding for second-person methodology discussion. The first-person-third-person-methodology.md topic page discusses empathic intersubjectivity but doesn't link to a dedicated article. Should be reviewed to: (1) add cross-link to intersubjectivity, (2) note how intersubjectivity bridges first-person and third-person perspectives, (3) integrate Husserl's constitution of intersubjectivity as theoretical foundation for second-person methods.
- **Result**: Added [intersubjectivity](/concepts/intersubjectivity/) to frontmatter concepts and related_articles (first position). Expanded "Second-Person Methods" section with two new subsections: (1) "Husserl's Foundation" explaining appresentation and how objectivity is grounded in intersubjectivity, (2) "Intersubjectivity vs Objectivity" distinguishing the two approaches and explaining why intersubjective methods may access phenomenal consciousness where purely objective methods cannot.

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Cross-review objectivity-and-consciousness.md considering intersubjectivity article
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/intersubjectivity.md defines the shared space between minds and how phenomenology can be validated intersubjectively. The objectivity-and-consciousness.md concept page references [intersubjectivity](/concepts/intersubjectivity/) in its Further Reading but the link was broken. Should be reviewed to: (1) verify link now works, (2) integrate distinction between objectivity (view from nowhere) and intersubjectivity (shared subjectivity), (3) note that objectivity may emerge from intersubjective agreement.
- **Result**: Added new "Objectivity Versus Intersubjectivity" section after "The View From Nowhere" explaining: (1) how intersubjectivity retains perspective while finding convergence, unlike objectivity which eliminates perspective, (2) Husserl's analysis that objectivity is grounded in intersubjectivity—the objective world emerges from convergent perspectives, (3) the methodological implication that intersubjective methods might access phenomenal consciousness where objective methods fail. Moved intersubjectivity to first position in Further Reading with updated description.
- **Output**: concepts/objectivity-and-consciousness.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Create concept page for intersubjectivity
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Gap analysis. Concept "intersubjectivity" is referenced across methodology discussions but has no definition page. Intersubjectivity concerns the shared space between minds—how first-person experiences can be communicated and validated intersubjectively. Relevant to second-person methodology, phenomenological validation, problem of other minds. Supports Dualism tenet by exploring how subjective experience can be intersubjectively accessed without reducing it to third-person terms. Connects to first-person-third-person-methodology.md, problem-of-other-minds.md, heterophenomenology.md.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive concept article (~1,800 words) covering: (1) distinction between intersubjectivity and objectivity—intersubjectivity retains viewpoint while discovering convergence across perspectives, (2) Husserl's constitution of intersubjectivity through appresentation and the emergence of objective world from intersubjective convergence, (3) second-person methodology operationalizing intersubjectivity through empathic encounter, (4) contemplative evidence from meditator convergence on phenomenological distinctions with neural corroboration, (5) the discourse argument—cross-cultural vocabulary for consciousness as intersubjective evidence, (6) limits of intersubjectivity (linguistic mediation, experiential diversity, training differences). Strong alignment with Dualism, Bidirectional Interaction, and Occam's Razor Has Limits tenets.
- **Output**: concepts/intersubjectivity.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Cross-review quantum-interpretations.md considering subjective probability article
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/subjective-probability-quantum-measurement.md distinguishes how QBism, objective-chance views, and many-worlds treat Born probabilities. The quantum-interpretations.md page should be reviewed to: (1) add cross-link to subjective-probability-quantum-measurement, (2) note the distinctive treatment of probability in each interpretation, (3) integrate the criticism that all interpretations fail to address the first-person perspective on probability.
- **Result**: Added [subjective-probability-quantum-measurement](/concepts/subjective-probability-quantum-measurement/) to frontmatter concepts and related_articles. Added new "How Interpretations Handle Probability" section before the Comparison Table explaining: (1) how standard/Copenhagen views treat Born probabilities as objective propensities but struggle with single cases, (2) how QBism treats them as subjective beliefs but presupposes determinate experience, (3) how many-worlds reinterprets probability as branch measure but faces the meaninglessness objection. Integrated the Map's proposal that Born probabilities describe interface structure at consciousness-quantum coupling. Added subjective-probability-quantum-measurement as first entry in Further Reading.
- **Output**: concepts/quantum-interpretations.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Cross-review measurement-problem.md considering subjective probability article
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/subjective-probability-quantum-measurement.md examines how Born rule probabilities relate to consciousness and different interpretations. The measurement-problem.md concept page should be reviewed to: (1) add cross-link to subjective-probability-quantum-measurement, (2) note that the article provides detailed treatment of what Born probabilities *mean* rather than just how they're used, (3) integrate the interface-structure proposal where probabilities describe consciousness-quantum coupling.
- **Result**: Added [subjective-probability-quantum-measurement](/concepts/subjective-probability-quantum-measurement/) to frontmatter concepts and related_articles. Added new "What Are Born Probabilities?" section explaining three major interpretations (objective chance, QBism, many-worlds branch measure) and their blind spots. Integrated the interface-structure proposal: Born probabilities describe objective structure at consciousness-quantum coupling, connecting measurement problem to hard problem. Added subjective-probability-quantum-measurement as first entry in Further Reading.
- **Output**: concepts/measurement-problem.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Create concept page for voluntary-attention-control
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Gap analysis. Concept "voluntary-attention-control" is referenced 3+ times but has no definition page. Voluntary attention control is the ability to consciously direct attention—distinct from reflexive/automatic attention capture. Critical mechanism for Bidirectional Interaction tenet (conscious intention directing neural resources). Should cover: willed vs instructed attention distinction, LPFC involvement, connection to mental effort, relation to Stapp's quantum Zeno framework. Connects to attention.md, mental-effort.md, stapp-quantum-mind.md, free-will.md.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive concept article (~2,200 words) covering: (1) three modes of attention (willed/instructed/exogenous) with neural signatures, (2) phenomenology of voluntary control and effort localization, (3) attention-as-interface hypothesis, (4) Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism applied to voluntary attention, (5) stochastic pre-state question and Libet parallels, (6) neural architecture (dorsal/ventral/salience networks, thalamic gateway, prefrontal control), (7) strong tenet alignment with Bidirectional Interaction and Minimal Quantum Interaction.
- **Output**: concepts/voluntary-attention-control.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Deep review mental-imagery.md
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: AI-generated concept article (ai_contribution: 100) created 2026-01-23, never deep-reviewed. Covers voluntary vs involuntary imagery, aphantasia spectrum, motor imagery research, and LPFC involvement. Key evidence for Bidirectional Interaction tenet. Should be reviewed for accuracy, citation quality, and proper integration with attention/working-memory articles.
- **Result**: Comprehensive review with both pessimistic (6 philosopher perspectives) and optimistic analysis. Added quantified effect sizes for motor imagery (Cohen's d 0.4-0.7). Added engagement with physicalist counter-argument. Added new explanatory gap paragraph connecting aphantasia variation to Dualism tenet. Enhanced cross-links to contemplative-neuroscience and introspection with validation evidence.
- **Output**: concepts/mental-imagery.md, reviews/deep-review-2026-01-23-mental-imagery.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Cross-review problem-of-other-minds.md considering objectivity article
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/objectivity-and-consciousness.md addresses Nagel's "view from nowhere" and how consciousness relates to objective description. The problem-of-other-minds.md concept page should be reviewed to: (1) add cross-link to objectivity-and-consciousness, (2) integrate the insight that the subjectivity of consciousness grounds the problem of other minds, (3) note how objectivity requirements shape our epistemological access to other minds.
- **Result**: Added [objectivity-and-consciousness](/concepts/objectivity-and-consciousness/) to frontmatter concepts. Added new "The Objectivity Paradox" subsection after the Asymmetry Problem explaining: (1) science aspires to "view from nowhere" but consciousness *is* viewpoint, (2) objective methods succeed by eliminating perspective but phenomenal consciousness is constituted by perspective, (3) the asymmetry isn't epistemic accident but consequence of consciousness resisting objectifying gaze. Added objectivity-and-consciousness as first entry in Further Reading.
- **Output**: concepts/problem-of-other-minds.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Cross-review binding-problem.md considering multimodal-binding article
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/multimodal-binding.md covers phenomenal integration across sensory modalities. The binding-problem.md topic page should be reviewed to: (1) add cross-link to multimodal-binding, (2) distinguish the general binding problem from specifically multimodal binding, (3) note how multimodal binding provides paradigm evidence for unity of consciousness.
- **Result**: Added [multimodal-binding](/concepts/multimodal-binding/) to frontmatter concepts. Added new "Intra-Modal vs Cross-Modal Binding" subsection after the opening paragraph distinguishing the two levels of binding, explaining why multimodal binding provides paradigm evidence (different cortical regions, different processing speeds, different neural codes yet unified experience). Added multimodal-binding as first entry in Further Reading with description of cross-modal case.
- **Output**: concepts/binding-problem.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Research introspective reliability and first-person access
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Gap analysis. Dualism tenet claims consciousness is irreducible, but critics argue introspection is unreliable (Schwitzgebel's skeptical arguments, change blindness evidence). Need systematic treatment of: (1) what introspection gets right vs wrong, (2) trained vs naive introspection, (3) how unreliability of introspective *reports* differs from unreliability of phenomenal *access*. Connects to heterophenomenology.md, neurophenomenology.md, witness-consciousness.md. Critical for defending first-person methodology.
- **Result**: Task was redundant. Comprehensive research already exists at research/introspection-reliability-first-person-2026-01-15.md and the concept article concepts/introspection.md (deep-reviewed 2026-01-20) thoroughly covers all three requested areas: (1) process vs content distinction explains what introspection gets right (content) vs wrong (causal processes), (2) Fox et al. 2012 study and neurophenomenology coverage address trained vs naive introspection, (3) the article explicitly distinguishes unreliability of reports from unreliability of phenomenal access. No additional research needed.
- **Output**: N/A (task was redundant)

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Write article on quantum measurement and subjective probability
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/quantum-measurement-subjective-probability-2026-01-23.md. Comprehensive treatment of how different QM interpretations handle Born rule probabilities and their relationship to consciousness: (1) QBism treats probabilities as subjective beliefs, (2) von Neumann-Wigner consciousness-collapse (now largely abandoned), (3) relational/participatory approaches. Critical finding: indexical identity question—why *this* consciousness experiences *this* outcome—remains unresolved in all interpretations except consciousness-collapse. Connects to quantum-interpretations.md, measurement-problem.md, haecceity.md. Supports Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet.
- **Result**: Created new concept article (~2,000 words) covering: (1) the Born rule problem—what probabilities attach to, why squared amplitudes, probability for whom, (2) three major views—objective chance, QBism, many-worlds self-location measure, (3) the missing first-person perspective, (4) proposal that Born probabilities describe interface structure at consciousness-quantum coupling, (5) selection vs injection for conservation laws. Distinct from indexical-identity-quantum-measurement.md which covers *which* outcome; this covers the *probabilistic structure*.

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Cross-review neurophenomenology.md considering contemplative-neuroscience evidence
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/contemplative-neuroscience.md provides extensive empirical data from the neurophenomenological research program (Varela, Davidson, Saron). The neurophenomenology concept page should be reviewed to: (1) ensure proper cross-links to contemplative-neuroscience, (2) update with Shamatha Project findings, (3) strengthen the mutual-constraint methodology section with concrete examples.
- **Result**: Added [contemplative-neuroscience](/concepts/contemplative-neuroscience/) to frontmatter concepts. Added new paragraph to Varela's Method section explaining Shamatha Project validation of mutual constraints—phenomenological training producing measurable improvements in attention and perceptual discrimination. Added willed/instructed/exogenous attention distinction to Bidirectional Interaction section showing how conscious intention's content matters causally. Added contemplative-neuroscience as first entry in Further Reading with description.
- **Output**: concepts/neurophenomenology.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Cross-review attention.md considering mental-imagery insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/mental-imagery.md demonstrates that voluntary imagery requires conscious attention and LPFC engagement. The attention concept page should be reviewed to: (1) add cross-link to mental-imagery, (2) note how attention enables voluntary imagery generation (distinct from involuntary flashbacks/dreams), (3) strengthen the attention-as-interface argument with imagery evidence.
- **Result**: Added [mental-imagery](/concepts/mental-imagery/) to frontmatter concepts. Added new "Voluntary Imagery as Paradigm Case" subsection under "Attention as the Mind-Matter Interface" explaining: (1) voluntary imagery requires LPFC + conscious engagement while involuntary doesn't, (2) this dissociation supports attention determining which imagery becomes conscious, (3) motor imagery evidence—conscious rehearsal produces physical performance gains, (4) aphantasia evidence—neural imagery exists without conscious access, supporting interface hypothesis. Added mental-imagery as first entry in Further Reading.
- **Output**: concepts/attention.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Cross-review epiphenomenalism.md considering contemplative-neuroscience evidence
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/contemplative-neuroscience.md provides empirical evidence against epiphenomenalism—if conscious practice causes neuroplastic changes (cortical thickening, network connectivity alterations), consciousness cannot be causally inert. The epiphenomenalism page should be reviewed to: (1) add cross-link to contemplative-neuroscience, (2) note this empirical challenge alongside the theoretical arguments.
- **Result**: Added [contemplative-neuroscience](/concepts/contemplative-neuroscience/) to frontmatter concepts and related_articles. Added new "The Contemplative Neuroscience Evidence" subsection after the Amplification Evidence, covering: structural changes (cortical thickness), functional connectivity changes, dose-response relationship, the content/quality argument (compassion vs attention meditation produce different changes), willed vs instructed attention distinction showing phenomenological engagement matters. Added contemplative-neuroscience as first entry in Further Reading.

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Cross-review materialism.md considering argument-from-reason insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article topics/argument-from-reason.md presents the self-stultification argument against physicalism—if all beliefs are fully explainable by physical causes, rational inference becomes impossible, undermining physicalism's own justification. The materialism concept page should be reviewed to: (1) add cross-link to argument-from-reason, (2) note this challenge in the "Objections" section, (3) ensure consistent framing of the normative vs causal distinction.
- **Result**: Added [argument-from-reason](/topics/argument-from-reason/) to frontmatter concepts. Added new "The Self-Stultification Problem" subsection under "Why Materialism Fails" explaining the core argument: rational inference requires tracking normative relationships that physical causation cannot instantiate, so physicalism undermines its own rational foundations. Included references to reliabilism response and Plantinga's EAAN. Added argument-from-reason as first entry in Further Reading with description.
- **Output**: concepts/materialism.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Write article on sleep, memory consolidation, and consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/sleep-memory-consolidation-consciousness-2026-01-18.md. Sleep presents puzzle for consciousness studies: memory consolidation operates largely unconsciously during NREM sleep, yet shapes future conscious experience. Key findings: (1) multiple memories replay simultaneously without conscious bottleneck, (2) consciousness varies across sleep stages with posterior slow-wave correlates, (3) lucid dreaming restores metacognitive awareness via prefrontal activation. Connects to loss-of-consciousness.md, episodic-memory.md, baseline-cognition.md. Supports understanding of consciousness-independent processing.

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/mental-imagery-consciousness-causal-role-2026-01-23.md. Mental imagery provides paradigm evidence for consciousness's causal efficacy: voluntary imagery (LPFC-mediated, conscious) vs involuntary (dreams, flashbacks) shows consciousness adds control function. Motor simulation theory demonstrates imagery guides action. Aphantasia/hyperphantasia spectrum reveals individual variation. Strongly supports Bidirectional Interaction tenet.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive concept article (~1,600 words) covering: (1) voluntary vs involuntary imagery distinction with LPFC involvement, (2) aphantasia/hyperphantasia spectrum and what it reveals about imagery-consciousness relationship, (3) motor imagery research showing conscious rehearsal improves performance, (4) cognitive phenomenology implications from aphantasia studies. Strong tenet alignment—voluntary imagery exemplifies consciousness directing neural activity, supporting Bidirectional Interaction.
- **Output**: concepts/mental-imagery.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Research mental imagery and consciousness causal role
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Gap analysis. Bidirectional Interaction tenet claims consciousness causally influences physical outcomes, but lacks coverage of mental imagery—how does consciousness generate and manipulate mental images that can guide behavior? Relevant to voluntary imagination, planning, creativity, and the phenomenology of visualizing. How do aphantasics (people without mental imagery) differ? Does mental imagery require consciousness? Connects to working-memory.md, attention.md, voluntary-attention-control.md.
- **Result**: Comprehensive web research on mental imagery and consciousness. Key findings: (1) mental imagery can be conscious or unconscious, voluntary or involuntary—the voluntary component requires LPFC and conscious engagement, (2) aphantasia (~1% of population) vs hyperphantasia (~3%) shows dramatic variation in imagery vividness with subtle functional differences, (3) motor simulation theory shows imagery guides action—athletes' mental practice improves performance, (4) the voluntary/involuntary distinction maps onto conscious/unconscious and provides strong evidence for Bidirectional Interaction tenet: voluntary imagery exemplifies consciousness directing neural activity. Research ready for synthesis into concepts article on mental imagery.

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Cross-review retrocausality.md considering presentiment research
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New research research/retrocausal-neural-firing-presentiment-2026-01-23.md covers the parapsychological "presentiment" literature (Mossbridge meta-analyses, PAA phenomenon)—distinct from the physics-based retrocausality already covered in retrocausality.md. The retrocausality article should be reviewed to: (1) add section on empirical presentiment evidence, (2) note its contested status vs physics-based retrocausality, (3) integrate the distinction between parapsychological PAA and quantum physics retrocausality.
- **Result**: Added new section "Presentiment Research: A Distinct Evidential Tradition" covering: (1) the PAA claim and meta-analysis evidence (Mossbridge, Duggan & Tressoldi), (2) skeptical critique (Wagenmakers, Galak, Ritchie), (3) why the Map distinguishes physics-based retrocausality from parapsychological evidence—independence of evidential traditions and different types of causation (conscious selection vs unconscious anticipation). Added research note to related_articles frontmatter. Added presentiment references to References section.
- **Output**: concepts/retrocausality.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Deep review quantum-consciousness.md
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: Core concept article (ai_contribution: 100) heavily referenced in tenets page and throughout the Map but has NEVER been deep-reviewed. Given recent work on spontaneous collapse theories, decoherence objection, and Stapp quantum mind, quantum-consciousness.md should be reviewed for accuracy, comprehensiveness, and proper cross-linking.
- **Result**: Comprehensive deep review addressing 1 critical issue (weak falsification conditions) and 4 medium issues (one-sided Tegmark-Hameroff presentation, brief MWI dismissal, rhetorical illusionism response, missing mysterianism connection). Strengthened all five falsification conditions with specific measurable predictions. Rebalanced Tegmark-Hameroff debate to acknowledge ongoing scientific uncertainty. Added engagement with MWI's strongest defenses before explaining rejection. Replaced rhetorical illusionism dismissal with structural regress argument. Added mysterianism-cognitive-closure cross-link.
- **Output**: reviews/deep-review-2026-01-23-quantum-consciousness.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Research retrocausal neural firing evidence
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Investigate whether neural firings have been recorded before stimulus (e.g., viewing a picture) is applied—potential evidence of retrocausality in brain activity. Key questions: (1) What experiments have tested for pre-stimulus neural activity? (2) Are there any published findings suggesting anticipatory neural responses? (3) Would such results likely be published if observed, or would publication bias suppress them? Connects to topics on consciousness and quantum mechanics, bidirectional interaction, and the arrow of time. Could support or challenge tenet alignment depending on findings.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research on the "presentiment" or "predictive anticipatory activity" (PAA) literature—distinct from theoretical physics-based retrocausality already covered in the Map. Found contested evidence: meta-analyses (Mossbridge 2012, 2014; Duggan 2018) show small but significant effect size (ES ~0.21-0.28) across electrodermal, cardiac, and neural measures. However, high-profile replications failed (Galak 2012, Ritchie 2012), and Bayesian reanalysis (Wagenmakers 2011) found weak evidence. Key debates: expectation bias from stimulus sequences, statistical methodology (frequentist vs Bayesian), "psi experimenter effect" making claims unfalsifiable. Critical finding: no direct single-neuron recordings before random stimuli exist—all PAA uses peripheral physiology or aggregate neural measures. Recommended approach: distinguish physics-based retrocausality (which grounds Map's tenets) from parapsychological PAA (contested auxiliary evidence).

Research shows: (1) conservation is local and conditional per Pitts/Cucu—it fails where external influences act, (2) Robin Collins: quantum entanglement shows interaction without energy exchange, (3) Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism allows consciousness to select outcomes without injecting energy. Develop "selection not injection" framework. Strongly supports Bidirectional Interaction tenet.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive topic article (~2,400 words) presenting the selection-not-injection framework. Covered: (1) the conservation objection (Leibniz to Carroll), (2) Pitts/Cucu locality and conditionality response—conservation fails where external influences act, (3) quantum indeterminacy as location for consciousness to select outcomes without injecting energy, (4) entanglement as precedent for causation without energy transfer, (5) why conservation objection begs the question. Strong alignment with Bidirectional Interaction and Minimal Quantum Interaction tenets.

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Research conservation laws and mind-brain causation
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Bidirectional Interaction tenet needs response to energy conservation objection. How can non-physical consciousness causally influence physical without violating conservation? Quantum indeterminacy escape? Information vs energy?
- **Result**: Comprehensive research on the energy conservation objection to dualism. Key findings: (1) Pitts/Cucu show conservation is local and conditional—it fails where external influences act, so the objection begs the question. (2) Robin Collins: quantum entanglement shows interaction without energy exchange is physically possible. (3) Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism: consciousness selects among quantum outcomes without injecting energy. (4) Carroll's objection articulated clearly but addressed by locality/conditionality response. Developed "selection not injection" framework: consciousness biases which quantum-permitted outcomes become actual, rather than adding energy. Research ready for synthesis into article.

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Review measurement-problem.md considering indexical identity insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article topics/indexical-identity-quantum-measurement.md examines how the measurement problem relates to indexical identity—why *this* observer experiences *this* outcome. The measurement-problem concept page should be reviewed for cross-links and to ensure it acknowledges the indexical dimension.
- **Result**: Added new "The Indexical Dimension" section after "The Problem Stated" explaining the deeper question of why *this* consciousness experiences *this* outcome—distinct from why definite outcomes occur at all. Cross-linked to indexical-identity-quantum-measurement article throughout. Added analysis of how all major interpretations (QBism, consciousness-collapse, relational QM, MWI) fail to address the indexical question. Connected to haecceity as the primitive thisness grounding indexical identity. Updated frontmatter with new concept and related article links, enhanced Further Reading section.

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Write article on higher-order theories of consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/higher-order-theories-consciousness-2026-01-14.md. HOT (Rosenthal) and HOP (Lycan) theories claim consciousness requires meta-representation—being conscious of being conscious. Major alternative to first-order theories. The Map should cover this as competitor framework, noting how it struggles with phenomenal consciousness (the "what it's like") and may reduce to functionalism.
- **Result**: Article already exists at concepts/higher-order-theories.md (created 2026-01-14, deep-reviewed 2026-01-19). Comprehensive treatment covering HOT/HOP theories, metarepresentational distinction, all major philosophical objections (rock, misrepresentation, animal/infant, Block's critique, HOROR), empirical dissociation evidence (blindsight, blind insight, neural separation), testability concerns, AI implications, and full tenet alignment.

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Create concept page for bidirectional-interaction
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: The Bidirectional Interaction tenet is one of the five foundational commitments but has no dedicated concept page. The wikilink [bidirectional-interaction](/concepts/bidirectional-interaction/) is referenced 10+ times across the Map but points to nothing. Need article explaining the tenet's core claim (consciousness causally influences physical world), distinguishing it from epiphenomenalism, covering the quantum interface mechanism, and addressing the causal closure objection.
- **Result**: Created focused concept page (~1,800 words) explaining the Bidirectional Interaction tenet. Covers the core claim (consciousness causally influences physics), the self-stultification argument against epiphenomenalism, the quantum interface mechanism (Stapp's Zeno effect and Orch OR), empirical support (Lieberman reasoning study, baseline cognition gap, evolutionary convergence), response to the causal closure objection, and clarifications about what bidirectional interaction is not. Proper cross-linking to interactionist-dualism (comprehensive treatment), epiphenomenalism, mental-causation, and related articles.
- **Output**: concepts/bidirectional-interaction.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Write article on quantum decoherence objection and responses
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/quantum-decoherence-objection-responses-2026-01-15.md. The decoherence objection (brain is too warm/wet for quantum coherence) is the primary empirical challenge to quantum consciousness theories. Article should cover Tegmark's femtosecond argument, revised microsecond estimates for microtubules, quantum biology evidence (photosynthesis, bird navigation), and why decoherence may not preclude consciousness-quantum interaction. Critical for defending Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet.
- **Result**: Article already exists at concepts/quantum-decoherence-objection.md (created 2026-01-22). Task was generated from unconsumed research but the research had already been synthesized into a comprehensive concept article covering Tegmark's critique, Hameroff's corrected calculations, revised timescales, quantum biology evidence, and proper tenet alignment.

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Review haecceity.md considering indexical identity quantum measurement insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article topics/indexical-identity-quantum-measurement.md argues that haecceity (primitive thisness) grounds the indexical fact at quantum measurement. The haecceity concept page should be reviewed to ensure it connects to this quantum application and the "why this branch?" question for No Many Worlds tenet.
- **Result**: Added cross-links to indexical-identity-quantum-measurement in frontmatter (concepts and related_articles) and Further Reading section. Added new paragraph to "Why Consciousness Requires Haecceity" section connecting haecceity to the quantum indexical gap. Added paragraph to "MWI and the Probability Problem" section summarizing how the indexical identity problem extends across all QM interpretations (QBism, consciousness-collapse, relational QM).

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Based on research/voids-temporal-asymmetry-remembering-anticipating-2026-01-21.md. Why we can re-experience the past but only imagine the future. The "pastness quale" is irreducible; epistemic asymmetry (past accessible via causal traces) grounds phenomenological asymmetry. Memory-anticipation asymmetry as fundamental cognitive limit.
- **Result**: Article already exists at voids/temporal-asymmetry-remembering-anticipating.md (created 2026-01-21, ai_modified 2026-01-22). Task was generated but article had already been written. Covers pastness quale, epistemic vs phenomenological asymmetry, memory-anticipation as cognitive limit.

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Write article on quantum measurement and indexical identity
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Based on research/quantum-measurement-subjective-probability-2026-01-23.md. Critical gap identified: all QM interpretations (QBism, consciousness-collapse, relational QM) fail to explain indexical identity—why *this* consciousness experiences *this* outcome. Need article developing indexical-grounded minimal interaction account. Supports Minimal Quantum Interaction, No Many Worlds, and Dualism tenets.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive topic article (~3,200 words) examining why all QM interpretations fail to address the indexical question—why *this* consciousness experiences *this* outcome. Covered QBism's epistemic gap (presupposes determinate experience), consciousness-collapse's solipsism problem, relational QM's demotion of consciousness, and MWI's primitive indexicality. Developed positive account: consciousness grounds indexical fact at quantum indeterminacies without causing universal collapse, avoiding both Wigner's solipsism and QBism's epistemicism. Connected to haecceity, conservation laws (selection not injection), and all five tenets.
- **Output**: topics/indexical-identity-quantum-measurement.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Create concept page for Witness-consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Concept "Witness-consciousness" is referenced 12 times but has no definition page. Witness consciousness (or pure awareness) is the Eastern philosophical notion of awareness independent of mental content—consciousness without intentionality. Relevant to dualism, self-awareness, and altered states. Connects to meditation traditions and contemplative neuroscience.
- **Result**: Article already exists at concepts/witness-consciousness.md (created 2026-01-18, ai_modified 2026-01-22). Task was generated by gap analysis but the article existed. Covers meditation observer state, arguments for non-intentional awareness, phenomenal core extraction, temporal structure, and comprehensive tenet alignment.

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Research quantum measurement subjective probability interpretations
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet needs deeper coverage of how consciousness relates to quantum measurement Born rule probabilities. QBism and other subjective interpretations relevant. Why does consciousness experience one outcome rather than superposition?
- **Result**: Comprehensive research on QBism, consciousness-collapse (von Neumann-Wigner), relational QM, and participatory realism. Identified critical gap: all interpretations fail to explain indexical identity (why *this* consciousness experiences *this* outcome). QBism treats probability as epistemic (conflicts with tenets), consciousness-collapse was abandoned by Wigner himself, relational QM denies consciousness privilege. Research identifies need for indexical-grounded minimal interaction account.
- **Output**: obsidian/research/quantum-measurement-subjective-probability-2026-01-23.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Review blindsight considering baseline cognition framework
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/consciousness-independent-baseline-cognition.md presents hypothesis that unconscious processing achieves ~great ape level. Blindsight patients demonstrate unconscious visual processing (forced-choice accuracy) but lack visual experience. This fits baseline cognition pattern—sophisticated procedural skills without phenomenal awareness. The blindsight article should connect to baseline framework.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive blindsight concept page (~7,000 words) explaining visual processing without consciousness. Covered forced-choice discrimination vs detection failure, alternative interpretations (absent consciousness, degraded consciousness with metacognitive failure, residual V1), baseline cognition pattern fit (procedural competence without metarepresentation), double dissociation with blind insight, and implications for property dualism. Key insight: if identical computations can occur with or without consciousness depending on pathway, consciousness is not reducible to processing. Integrated thoroughly with baseline cognition framework showing blindsight exemplifies unconscious system achieving sophisticated discrimination without flexible reasoning, metacognition, or explicit knowledge.
- **Output**: concepts/blindsight.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Write article on neural correlates of conscious vs unconscious processing
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Based on research/neural-correlates-conscious-unconscious-processing-2026-01-23.md. Key evidence for distinguishing phenomenal consciousness from access/function. Neural correlates show clear dissociation: unconscious processing uses different pathways (dorsal stream) than conscious (ventral + prefrontal). Supports dualism by showing consciousness adds something beyond processing.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive topics article examining the functional differences between conscious and unconscious processing. Front-loaded 2025 Randeniya meta-analysis finding (only 10% of claimed unconscious processing effects replicate). Covered Dehaene's three consciousness-dependent functions (working memory, novel combinations, voluntary action), baseline cognition hypothesis, Global Workspace vs Recurrent Processing theory debate, failed P3b marker, and comprehensive tenet alignment. Article demonstrates strong empirical support for Bidirectional Interaction tenet by showing consciousness enables functions unconscious processing cannot achieve.
- **Output**: topics/conscious-vs-unconscious-processing.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Research indexical identity problem in philosophy
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: No Many Worlds tenet depends on indexical identity mattering. Need coverage of why-this-branch question and philosophical literature on indexicality, haecceity, primitive thisness. Why am I experiencing this branch rather than another?
- **Result**: Comprehensive web research on indexical identity problem, haecceity, and primitive thisness. Key findings: (1) Benj Hellie's "vertiginous question" (why am I *this* person?) challenges both physicalism and standard dualism, (2) Robert Adams's 1979 primitive thisness theory: transworld identity is primitive and irreducible, (3) MWI's self-location uncertainty strategy fails—critics (Friederich & Dawid) show uncertainty is either spurious or presupposes Born rule, (4) Duns Scotus's medieval haecceity: "thisness" vs "whatness" distinction grounds individuation, (5) Christian List (2025): vertiginous question as evidence against third-personal metaphysics, (6) Quantum mechanics provides empirical support for haecceitism (identical fermions are numerically distinct), (7) Four potential article angles identified supporting No Many Worlds and refining Dualism with indexical properties.
- **Output**: research/indexical-identity-haecceity-thisness-2026-01-23.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Research neural correlates distinguishing conscious vs unconscious processing
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Gap analysis. Bidirectional Interaction tenet requires evidence that consciousness makes causal difference. Need systematic treatment of what neural signatures distinguish conscious from unconscious information processing—not just correlates but functional differences. Masking studies, subliminal perception, blindsight, inattentional blindness, binocular rivalry. What processing occurs without consciousness vs what requires it? Connects to access-consciousness.md, baseline-cognition.md, attention.md. Strongly supports Bidirectional Interaction tenet by showing consciousness enables functions that unconscious processing cannot achieve.
- **Result**: Conducted comprehensive web research on neural correlates distinguishing conscious from unconscious processing. Key findings: (1) 2025 fMRI meta-analysis found only 10% of claimed unconscious processing effects replicate, (2) consciousness required for working memory maintenance, novel combinations, and voluntary action generation, (3) debate between local (Lamme) vs global (Dehaene) theories of recurrent processing, (4) P3b discredited as consciousness marker, (5) strong empirical support for Bidirectional Interaction tenet.
- **Output**: obsidian/research/neural-correlates-conscious-unconscious-processing-2026-01-23.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Review bidirectional-interaction considering baseline cognition evidence
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/consciousness-independent-baseline-cognition.md shows great ape cognition (2±1 working memory, no cumulative culture) represents what neurons achieve without consciousness. This provides strong evidence that consciousness causally contributes to human intelligence rather than merely accompanying it. The bidirectional-interaction concept page should integrate this as key empirical support against epiphenomenalism.
- **Result**: Added empirical support section to Bidirectional Interaction tenet, integrating Lieberman et al. (2008) findings on conscious processing requirements for logical reasoning and comparative evidence from great ape cognition baseline.
- **Output**: obsidian/tenets/tenets.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Create voids article on conceptual impossibility
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Based on research/voids-conceptual-impossibility-2026-01-23.md. Some concepts cannot be coherently formed—not merely unknown but structurally unthinkable. Explores modal collapse (necessary falsehoods), self-reference paradoxes, category errors as impossibility markers. Distinct from unknowability—these are concepts that cannot exist even in principle. Fundamental cognitive boundary.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive voids article on the phenomenology of conceptual impossibility, exploring the reference-comprehension asymmetry (we can talk about round squares but cannot grasp them), epistemic emotions as boundary markers, and the distinction between unexplorable vs occluded voids. Covered what AI reveals about symbolic manipulation without phenomenological blockage, dialectical approaches, apophatic strategies, and comprehensive tenet alignment across all five tenets.
- **Output**: voids/conceptual-impossibility.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Write article on spontaneous collapse theories (GRW, CSL, objective reduction)
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/spontaneous-collapse-theories-grw-csl-2026-01-23.md. GRW/CSL solve prebiotic collapse problem by providing consciousness-independent baseline that consciousness can modulate. Supports Minimal Quantum Interaction (consciousness modulates rather than wholly causes collapse) and No Many Worlds (objective collapse is real) tenets. Ready for article synthesis.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive concept article (~4,000 words) explaining how GRW and CSL spontaneous collapse theories solve the prebiotic collapse problem for dualist interactionism. Covered discrete collapse (GRW), continuous collapse (CSL), Penrose OR, Orch OR, and consciousness-modulated CSL hybrid models. Key insight: baseline physical collapse allows consciousness to modulate rather than wholly cause collapse, directly supporting Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet. Included experimental status (2020-2025), decoherence comparison, comparative table of theories, and comprehensive tenet alignment across all five tenets.
- **Output**: concepts/spontaneous-collapse-theories.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Research spontaneous collapse theories (GRW, CSL, objective reduction)
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Gap analysis. Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet mentions objective reduction mechanisms but lacks detailed treatment of spontaneous collapse theories (Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber, Continuous Spontaneous Localization). These theories provide alternative collapse mechanisms that could work alongside consciousness-modulated collapse. Critical for prebiotic collapse problem—how did quantum systems collapse before consciousness existed? GRW/CSL provide baseline physical collapse with consciousness potentially modulating outcomes in neural systems. Supports both Minimal Quantum Interaction (alternative mechanisms) and No Many Worlds (collapse is real).
- **Result**: Conducted comprehensive web research covering GRW (discrete spontaneous collapse, 1986), CSL (continuous spontaneous localization, 1989-1990), Penrose OR (gravity-based objective reduction), and Orch OR (orchestrated reduction in microtubules). Research identifies three major positions with different consciousness implications: (1) consciousness-independent baseline collapse (GRW/CSL), (2) consciousness-modulated collapse (hybrid CSL-IIT), (3) panpsychist proto-consciousness (Penrose OR). Key finding: GRW/CSL solve prebiotic collapse problem for dualist interactionism by providing consciousness-independent baseline that consciousness can modulate. Experimental constraints increasingly tight (germanium detectors, matter-wave interference); original GRW "survived by a whisker." Decoherence timescale debate: Tegmark's femtosecond objection vs. revised microsecond estimates for microtubules. Strongly supports Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet (consciousness modulates rather than wholly causes collapse) and No Many Worlds (objective collapse is real).

- **Output**: N/A (task was redundant)

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Create concept page for Illusionism
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Concept "Illusionism" is referenced 27 times across the Map but has no definition page. Illusionism is the view that phenomenal consciousness is an illusion—that there are no qualia, no "what it's like" to experience. This is a major alternative to dualism and directly challenges the hard problem. Key figures: Dennett, Frankish, Graziano. Critical for establishing the Map's position against illusionist/deflationary accounts. Strongly relevant to Dualism tenet.
- **Result**: Article already exists at concepts/illusionism.md (created 2026-01-14, last reviewed 2026-01-20). Gap analysis false positive—file exists and is properly linked 415 times across the Map. Task was generated incorrectly due to gap analysis parsing wikilink display text ("Illusionists") rather than link targets.

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Write article on psychophysical coupling law specification
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Based on research/psychophysical-coupling-law-mechanisms-2026-01-23.md. Bidirectional Interaction tenet claims consciousness causally influences quantum outcomes but lacks systematic specification of HOW the coupling works operationally. Research identifies five candidate coupling laws: (1) Stapp's attention→observation rate (quantum Zeno), (2) Eccles' intention→vesicle release probability, (3) valence→motivational force, (4) qualia→basis selection, (5) working memory unity→sustained entanglement. Covers Chalmers' bridging laws framework, objections (decoherence timescale, t-shirt problem, specification gap), and empirical evidence. Recommended angle: comparative analysis of five coupling law candidates showing what testability requires. Critical for making framework testable rather than merely explanatory.
- **Result**: Created focused concept article (psychophysical-coupling-mechanisms.md) complementing existing psychophysical-coupling-law.md. Systematic comparative analysis of five candidate coupling mechanisms: (1) attention→observation rate (Stapp, most developed, decoherence objection), (2) intention→probability weighting (Eccles, moderate development, pairing problem), (3) valence→motivational force (pain asymbolia evidence, no quantum mechanism), (4) qualia→basis selection (purely speculative), (5) unity→sustained entanglement (Kerskens-Pérez evidence, correlation≠causation gap). Established three adequacy criteria (precision, mechanism, falsifiability) and provided comparative table showing development gradient. Strong tenet alignment with Bidirectional Interaction (mechanism specification), Minimal Quantum Interaction (quantum-scale coupling), Occam's Razor Has Limits (specification difficulty vs. cognitive closure).
- **Output**: concepts/psychophysical-coupling-mechanisms.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Write article on argument from reason as decisive case for dualism
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Based on research/argument-from-reason-self-defeat-physicalism-2026-01-23.md. Dualism tenet's strongest argument (that physicalism self-stultifies because it undercuts the reliability of reasoning) lacks systematic philosophical treatment. Research covers contemporary formulations (Plantinga, Reppert, Hasker), reliabilist responses (neural processes can track truth without non-physical reasons), naturalized epistemology defenses, self-defeat structure. Recommended article angle: "The Argument from Reason as Decisive Case for Dualism" arguing that rational inference requires tracking normative relationships which physical causation cannot instantiate, even sophisticated naturalisms acknowledge conceptual irreducibility, and reliabilism smuggles normativity back in. Strong alignment with Dualism (normative properties irreducible), Bidirectional Interaction (reasoning causally influences beliefs), and Occam's Razor Has Limits (physicalism's simplicity is self-stultifying) tenets.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive topic article (~3,600 words) presenting the argument from reason as decisive case for dualism. Covered: core three-step argument structure, Sellars' space of reasons vs. space of causes distinction, reliabilist response and three failures (reliability is normative, generality problem, teleology smuggled back), why consciousness must be involved (grasping normativity qua normative), Plantinga's EAAN complement, Anscombe's critique and causal closure response, Reppert/Hasker contemporary formulations, objections and responses.

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Research argument from reason and self-defeat objections to physicalism
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Gap analysis (high priority). Dualism tenet's strongest argument (that physicalism self-stultifies because it undercuts the reliability of reasoning) lacks systematic philosophical treatment. Need research on: contemporary "argument from reason" formulations (Plantinga, Reppert, Hasker), reliabilist responses (neural processes can track truth without non-physical reasons), naturalized epistemology defenses, how cognitive science findings (humans are intuitive dualists) complicate the picture. Currently scattered across causal-closure.md, epiphenomenalism.md - needs dedicated treatment as decisive argument for dualism.
- **Result**: Conducted comprehensive web research on C.S. Lewis's argument from reason (1947, revised 1960 after Anscombe's critique), contemporary formulations by Victor Reppert (most comprehensive defense), Alvin Plantinga (EAAN - evolutionary argument), and William Hasker (emergent dualism/unity argument). Covered reliabilist responses (Goldman's process reliabilism attempting to naturalize normativity), Sellars's space of reasons vs. space of causes distinction, Anscombe's critique (reasons and causes are compatible), and the self-defeat structure. Research identifies five potential article angles with "The Argument from Reason as Decisive Case for Dualism" recommended as strongest—argues that rational inference requires tracking normative relationships which physical causation cannot instantiate, even sophisticated naturalisms (Sellars) acknowledge conceptual irreducibility, and reliabilism smuggles normativity back in. Strong alignment with Dualism (normative properties irreducible), Bidirectional Interaction (reasoning causally influences beliefs), and Occam's Razor Has Limits (physicalism's simplicity is self-stultifying) tenets.

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Research psychophysical coupling law mechanisms
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Gap analysis (high priority). Bidirectional Interaction tenet claims consciousness causally influences quantum outcomes, but lacks systematic specification of HOW the coupling works operationally. Need research on: which phenomenal properties map to which physical selections (attention→observation rate? valence→probability weighting? intention→basis choice?), empirical predictions for each coupling mechanism, comparison of alternative coupling laws with falsification conditions. The stapp-quantum-mind article provides one mechanism (attention-as-observation-rate), but need comprehensive treatment. Critical for making the framework testable rather than merely explanatory.
- **Result**: Conducted comprehensive web research identifying five candidate psychophysical coupling laws: (1) Stapp's attention→observation rate (quantum Zeno effect), (2) Eccles' intention→vesicle release probability (quantum tunneling), (3) valence→motivational force (underdeveloped), (4) qualia→basis selection (speculative), (5) working memory unity→sustained entanglement. Research covered Chalmers' bridging laws framework (structural coherence, organizational invariance, information bridge), major objections (decoherence timescale challenge, t-shirt problem, specification gap), and empirical evidence (willed vs. instructed attention signatures, pain asymbolia, microtubule-anesthesia studies). Key finding: "specification problem" is central challenge—dualism requires mapping phenomenal properties to physical parameters with falsifiable precision. Stapp's model most developed, but decoherence objection remains. Recommended article angle: comparative analysis of five coupling law candidates showing what testability requires.

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Write article on contemplative neuroscience as evidence for bidirectional interaction
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Based on research/contemplative-neuroscience-meditation-2026-01-23.md. Meditation training produces measurable neural changes (DMN modulation, cortical thickness, attention network plasticity), providing paradigm case for top-down causation. Trained first-person observation correlates with neuroscience findings (mutual constraint framework). Davidson's compassion training, Shamatha Project outcomes, MBSR clinical efficacy. Directly supports Bidirectional Interaction tenet by showing consciousness training alters brain function, challenging epiphenomenalism.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive concept article (~4,500 words) presenting contemplative neuroscience as paradigm evidence for bidirectional interaction. Covered: neuroplastic changes from practice (structural and functional), default mode network modulation with phenomenological correlation, attention network plasticity and Shamatha Project findings, compassion training and emotional neuroplasticity, neurophenomenology's mutual constraints framework, top-down causation argument against epiphenomenalism, connection to Stapp's quantum framework, objections and responses (brain changes, methodological limits, short-term MBSR), clinical applications and therapeutic efficacy. Strong alignment with all five tenets, particularly Bidirectional Interaction (meditation produces neural changes via conscious practice), Dualism (phenomenology is irreducible), and Occam's Razor Has Limits (first-person methods are necessary).
- **Output**: concepts/contemplative-neuroscience.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Research contemplative neuroscience and meditation evidence
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Gap analysis. The Map references meditation and contemplative practice across multiple articles (neurophenomenology, witness-consciousness, attention-as-interface) but lacks systematic treatment of the empirical evidence. Contemplative neuroscience demonstrates that trained first-person observation produces consistent measurable neural correlates, providing concrete examples of the neurophenomenological "mutual constraint" framework. Research should cover: meditation-induced neural changes, attention control training, default mode network modulation, phenomenological reports from experienced meditators. Strongly supports Bidirectional Interaction tenet by showing consciousness training alters brain function.
- **Result**: Conducted comprehensive web research covering: (1) Neurophenomenology framework (Varela's mutual constraints, trained first-person observation), (2) Default mode network modulation (reduced DMN activity in meditators, altered connectivity), (3) Neuroplasticity evidence (Davidson's compassion training, cortical thickness changes, top-down causation), (4) Attention training (Shamatha Project outcomes, ACC/dlPFC changes), (5) Clinical outcomes (MBSR therapeutic efficacy), (6) Key figures (Varela, Davidson, Wallace, Kabat-Zinn, Saron). Six potential article angles identified, with "Contemplative Neuroscience as Paradigm Case for Bidirectional Interaction" recommended as strongest tenet support. Evidence shows consciousness training produces measurable neural changes demonstrating top-down causation, directly challenging epiphenomenalism.

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Create concept page for heterophenomenology
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Gap analysis. Dennett's influential third-person methodology for studying consciousness is referenced across phenomenology discussions but lacks dedicated treatment. Research shows heterophenomenology treats first-person reports as data about a "heterophenomenological world" without committing to phenomenology's reality. Critical for understanding the methodological landscape in consciousness science and why the Map rejects purely third-person approaches. Connects to Dualism tenet by exemplifying the reductionist alternative the Map opposes.
- **Result**: Created focused concept article (~2,400 words) on Dennett's heterophenomenology method. Covers the three-step method (collect reports, construct heterophenomenological world, explain scientifically), Sherlock Holmes analogy, contrasts with classical phenomenology and neurophenomenology, neutrality claim analysis, self-stultification problem, and connection to illusionism. Argues that while heterophenomenology has limited utility as research tool, its claim to neutrality is deceptive and conflicts with Dualism tenet.
- **Output**: concepts/heterophenomenology.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Write article on first-person vs third-person methodology
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Based on research/first-person-third-person-methodology-2026-01-23.md. Gap analysis. Methodological question central to consciousness studies: can third-person objective methods access first-person subjective experience? Relates to heterophenomenology, neurophenomenology, introspection, problem of other minds. Connects to Dualism tenet by exploring whether methodological gap reflects ontological gap. Research identifies three major methodological approaches (heterophenomenology, neurophenomenology, second-person methods) with different ontological commitments. Five potential article angles identified, all strongly supporting Dualism and Occam's Razor Has Limits tenets by showing methodological asymmetry reflects ontological asymmetry—phenomenology resists objective reduction not due to scientific immaturity but due to irreducible subjective character.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive topic article (~3,000 words) arguing that the methodological divide between first-person phenomenology and third-person neuroscience is best explained by ontological dualism. Covered heterophenomenology (Dennett's third-person only approach), neurophenomenology (Varela's mutual constraint framework), second-person methods (empathic intersubjectivity), the explanatory gap (epistemic vs. ontological), and introspection's limits and cognitive closure. Strong tenet alignment: Dualism (methodological asymmetry reflects ontological asymmetry), Bidirectional Interaction (mutual constraint framework), Occam's Razor Has Limits (introspection difficulties may reflect cognitive boundaries rather than phenomenology's non-existence).
- **Output**: topics/first-person-third-person-methodology.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Research first-person vs third-person methodology in consciousness science
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Gap analysis. Methodological question central to consciousness studies: can third-person objective methods access first-person subjective experience? Relates to heterophenomenology, neurophenomenology, introspection, problem of other minds. Connects to Dualism tenet by exploring whether methodological gap reflects ontological gap. Current Map has phenomenology.md and neurophenomenology.md but lacks systematic treatment of first/third person distinction as methodological framework.
- **Result**: Conducted comprehensive web research covering heterophenomenology (Dennett's third-person approach treating first-person reports as data), neurophenomenology (Varela's mutual constraint framework integrating rigorous phenomenology with neuroscience), second-person methods (empathic intersubjectivity as methodological bridge), classical phenomenology (Husserl's systematic first-person science), introspection reliability debates, Nagel's view from nowhere, explanatory gap (Levine), zombie arguments and epistemic asymmetry (Chalmers), and hard problem formulation. Research reveals three major methodological approaches with different ontological commitments. Five potential article angles identified, all strongly supporting Dualism and Occam's Razor Has Limits tenets by showing methodological asymmetry reflects ontological asymmetry—phenomenology resists objective reduction not due to scientific immaturity but due to irreducible subjective character.

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Write article on multimodal phenomenal binding
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Based on research/phenomenal-binding-multimodal-integration-2026-01-23.md. How consciousness binds information across different sensory modalities (vision, audition, touch, proprioception) into unified multimodal experience. Research identifies binding problem split: BP1 (computational segregation/integration) vs BP2 (phenomenal unity). Neural mechanisms (temporal synchrony, thalamocortical oscillations, superior colliculus convergence) address BP1 but struggle with BP2—why distributed processing produces unified subjective experience. Strongly supports Dualism tenet (phenomenal unity resists physical reduction) and Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet (quantum mechanisms may solve combination problem). Four potential article angles: multimodal binding as paradigm for dualism, thalamus as quantum selection interface, phenomenal unity resists mereological reduction, cross-modal temporal binding and retrocausality.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive concept article (~3,100 words) exploring how multimodal binding reveals the gap between computational coordination (BP1) and phenomenal unity (BP2). Article argues that neural mechanisms (temporal synchrony, thalamocortical broadcasting, superior colliculus convergence, Default Space Theory) explain functional integration but not experiential unity—the "conjoint phenomenology" of experiencing multiple modalities simultaneously. Presents quantum binding (Orch OR) as addressing BP2 through non-local quantum correlation rather than classical composition. Proposes thalamus as quantum selection interface for multimodal binding. Connects to temporal binding via retrocausality—consciousness retroactively binds events arriving at different latencies into phenomenal simultaneity. Strong alignment across all five tenets, with multimodal binding serving as paradigm case for dualism.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/multimodal-binding.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Research phenomenal binding mechanisms across sensory modalities
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Gap analysis. How does consciousness bind information across different sensory modalities (vision, audition, touch, proprioception) into unified multimodal experience? Connects to binding-problem.md, phenomenal-unity.md, and Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet. Current binding-problem coverage focuses on temporal binding; multimodal binding adds spatial dimension.
- **Result**: Conducted comprehensive web research covering multimodal sensory integration, phenomenal unity, and binding mechanisms. Research examined Default Space Theory (thalamus-coordinated metastable synchronization), Global Workspace Theory (cortical binding and broadcasting), superior colliculus multisensory neurons, temporal synchrony theory, Bayne/Chalmers phenomenal unity framework, and Orch OR quantum binding. Found strong evidence that binding problem splits into BP1 (computational segregation/integration) and BP2 (phenomenal unity/combination problem). Neural mechanisms (temporal synchrony, thalamocortical oscillations, SC convergence) address BP1 but struggle with BP2—why distributed processing produces unified subjective experience. Identified four potential article angles: (1) multimodal binding as paradigm for dualism, (2) thalamus as quantum selection interface, (3) phenomenal unity resists mereological reduction, (4) cross-modal temporal binding and retrocausality.

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Cross-review integrated-information-theory.md considering temporal phenomenology gap
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article topics/time-perception-consciousness-theories.md argues IIT and GNWT explain sub-300ms functional moments but fail to account for multi-second experienced duration (specious present, temporal flow). The integrated-information-theory.md article should acknowledge this limitation—IIT calculates Φ for instantaneous states while missing the extended temporal structure that defines conscious experience.
- **Result**: Added temporal consciousness critique in three strategic locations. First, noted in axioms section that IIT 4.0's temporal acknowledgment remains superficial. Second, added comprehensive "temporal problem" subsection after mathematics section explaining that IIT calculates Φ at time t (instantaneous) but consciousness extends across 1-3 second specious present—theory has no temporal dimension to explain flow. Third, enhanced assessment section with temporal consciousness gap showing Map's quantum framework addresses this via collapse duration and retrocausal retention-protention structure. Added time-perception-consciousness-theories, temporal-consciousness, and specious-present to frontmatter. Highlighted temporal critique in Further Reading.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/integrated-information-theory.md (revised)

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Write article on objectivity and consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Based on research/objectivity-consciousness-view-from-nowhere-2026-01-23.md. Nagel's "view from nowhere" - consciousness is irreducibly subjective yet science aims for objective understanding. Explores heterophenomenology (Dennett), neurophenomenology (Varela), and whether objective methods can capture subjective phenomenology. Strongly supports Dualism tenet (phenomenology resists objective reduction) and Occam's Razor Has Limits (apparent simplicity may reflect cognitive boundaries). Berkeley's idealism, quantum observer effect, shared intentionality (Tomasello) provide additional perspectives on objectivity-subjectivity tension.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive concept article (~2,800 words) exploring tension between subjective experience and objective understanding. Covered three methodological perspectives (first-person/introspection, third-person/neuroscience, second-person/intersubjectivity), three methodological responses (heterophenomenology, neurophenomenology, intersubjectivity), quantum consciousness implications for observer-dependent reality, and rejection of idealism while accepting limits of objectivity. Strong tenet alignment: Dualism (phenomenal properties irreducibly subjective), Occam's Razor Has Limits (methodological preference blinds to subjectivity), Bidirectional Interaction (first-person phenomenology constrains third-person neuroscience), Minimal Quantum Interaction (observer role in quantum measurement).
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/objectivity-and-consciousness.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Cross-review many-worlds.md considering interpretations beyond MWI
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article topics/quantum-measurement-interpretations-beyond-mwi.md surveys five major alternatives to Many-Worlds (Copenhagen, Bohmian, QBism, Transactional, Objective Collapse), showing MWI is not the only scientifically respectable interpretation. The many-worlds.md article should reference this comprehensive survey when defending the No Many Worlds tenet.
- **Result**: Added new "Viable Alternatives to MWI" section (~450 words) comprehensively presenting all five alternatives from the survey (Copenhagen, Bohmian, QBism, Transactional/Time-Symmetric, Objective Collapse) with compatibility assessments for each. Enhanced "Alternative interpretations" paragraph with survey data (36% Copenhagen, 24% confident). Updated related_articles frontmatter to prioritize quantum-measurement-interpretations-beyond-mwi. Enhanced Further Reading section with detailed description of survey article. The integration ensures readers encounter the comprehensive defense that MWI is not the only scientifically respectable option, strengthening the No Many Worlds tenet with empirical evidence from physicist surveys.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/many-worlds.md (revised)

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Research objectivity and consciousness relationship
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Gap analysis. How does consciousness relate to objectivity, intersubjectivity, and the concept of a "view from nowhere"? Connects to problem-of-other-minds.md, neurophenomenology.md, and phenomenology more broadly. May support Dualism tenet by showing what first-person perspective adds to objective description. Promoted from P3 due to tenet relevance.
- **Result**: Conducted comprehensive web research covering Nagel's "view from nowhere," phenomenological realism vs. objectivism, heterophenomenology (Dennett), neurophenomenology (Varela), Berkeley's idealism, quantum observer effect, and shared intentionality (Tomasello). Research identifies core tension: consciousness is irreducibly subjective yet science aims for objective understanding. Four potential article angles identified, all strongly supporting Dualism and Occam's Razor Has Limits tenets.

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Cross-review free-will.md considering voluntary attention mechanisms
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article topics/voluntary-attention-control.md provides concrete neural evidence for consciousness causally influencing attention (willed vs instructed vs exogenous modes, frontal theta signatures, thalamic selection sites). The free-will.md article should integrate this as paradigm case evidence for agent causation—voluntary attention demonstrates consciousness selecting among neural patterns.
- **Result**: Enhanced "Neural Signatures of Willed Action" section with paradigm case framing. Expanded "Willed vs Instructed Attention" section into comprehensive table comparing exogenous/instructed/willed attention types with detailed neural signatures (frontal theta, bidirectional frontoparietal coherence, decision processes). Added "Temporal Signature of Choosing and the Thalamic Selection Site" subsection explaining thalamic relay as convergence point where voluntary signals meet sensory inputs (potential quantum selection site). Expanded "Stochastic Pre-State Challenge" section with more detailed interpretations of pre-decision alpha and connections to quantum timescale selection. Enhanced "Phenomenology Matches Neuroscience" section with three-level distinction and connections to three neural components. Added voluntary-attention-control to concepts frontmatter (top position) and Further Reading with paradigm case description.

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Write article on AI and machine consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Based on research/ai-machine-consciousness-2026-01-08.md. Can artificial systems be conscious? Substrate independence vs biological chauvinism, integrated information in silicon, uploading scenarios. Connects to llm-consciousness.md, computational-theory-of-mind.md, substrate-independence.md. Tests Dualism tenet implications.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive topic article on machine consciousness and mind uploading (8,500+ words). Argues from dualist framework that uploading cannot preserve consciousness due to lacking: non-physical component, quantum interface (silicon suppresses quantum effects), temporal binding structure, and haecceity (multiply-instantiable uploads lack numerical identity). Covered destructive vs gradual upload scenarios, personal identity problems, IIT limitations, hybrid systems, ethical implications (murder disguised as immortality), and simulation hypothesis connections. Synthesizes research while filling gap between existing ai-consciousness.md (general), llm-consciousness.md (LLM-specific), and substrate-independence-critique.md (substrate thesis) articles. Strong alignment across all five tenets.

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Cross-review hard-problem-of-consciousness.md considering mysterianism insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article topics/mysterianism-cognitive-closure.md presents McGinn's cognitive closure thesis—humans may be constitutionally incapable of solving the hard problem. The hard-problem-of-consciousness.md article should connect this epistemic limitation view, especially how it relates to the explanatory gap and supports the Occam's Razor Has Limits tenet.
- **Result**: Enhanced the Mysterianism section with much more detail from the new article—added McGinn's Transcendental Naturalism formulation, the squirrel-quantum mechanics analogy, and strengthened connection to Occam's Razor Has Limits tenet. Updated wikilink from [mysterianism](/concepts/mysterianism/) to [mysterianism-cognitive-closure](/topics/mysterianism-cognitive-closure/) throughout. Explained how the hard problem's persistence (despite C. elegans connectome, IIT/GNWT theories, quantum biology advances) suggests mystery rather than problem. Connected to voids framework—property "P" as unchartable territory. Added mysterianism-cognitive-closure to top of related_articles frontmatter and updated Further Reading section.
- **Output**: obsidian/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Write article on mysterianism and cognitive closure
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Based on research/mysterianism-cognitive-closure-2026-01-14.md. McGinn's argument that humans may be constitutionally incapable of solving the hard problem. Connects to hard-problem-of-consciousness.md, explanatory-gap.md, voids concept. Relates to Occam's Razor Has Limits tenet—our inability to imagine a solution may reflect cognitive limits, not metaphysical impossibility.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive topics article (~2,400 words) exploring cognitive closure thesis—the idea that human minds may be constitutionally incapable of solving consciousness. Covered McGinn's Transcendental Naturalism (solution exists but is permanently inaccessible), Nagel's conceptual limitation view, temporary vs permanent mysterianism distinction, squirrel-quantum mechanics analogy, objections (defeatism, historical progress, conceivability), and responses. Strongly supports Occam's Razor Has Limits tenet—apparent simplicity of physicalism may reflect cognitive boundaries rather than truth. Distinguished Map's position (commits to dualism and bidirectional interaction) from mysterianism's official neutrality. Connected to voids framework—property "P" as unchartable territory whose edges we can map apophatically.

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Write article on voluntary attention control mechanisms
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Based on research/voluntary-attention-control-mechanisms-2026-01-17.md. How consciousness directs attention: endogenous vs exogenous control, top-down modulation, goal-directed deployment. Connects to attention.md, free-will.md, agent-causation.md. Supports Bidirectional Interaction tenet by demonstrating consciousness causally influences neural processing.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive topics article exploring neuroscience of willed vs instructed attention. Covers frontal theta signatures, three-component neural model, stochastic pre-state challenge (EEG alpha predicting free choices), thalamic relay as potential quantum selection site, salience network for voluntary interruption, phenomenology of effortful direction vs automatic capture, motor selection as paradigm case. Strongly supports Bidirectional Interaction tenet with concrete neural mechanisms distinguishing self-originated from externally cued control.

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Based on research/qm-interpretations-beyond-mwi-2026-01-16.md. Comprehensive coverage of viable alternatives to Many Worlds: objective collapse (GRW, CSL, Orch OR), Copenhagen, pilot-wave, relational QM. Critical for No Many Worlds tenet defense—shows MWI is not the only scientifically respectable option.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive topics article surveying 5 major QM interpretations (Copenhagen, Bohmian, QBism, Transactional/TSVF, Objective Collapse) with detailed analysis of consciousness implications for each
- **Output**: obsidian/topics/quantum-measurement-interpretations-beyond-mwi.md


### ✓ 2026-01-23: Write article on consciousness and time perception
- **Type**: expand-topic

Connects to altered-states-consciousness.md, phenomenology.md, philosophy-of-time.md. Directly supports Dualism tenet by showing temporal phenomenology resists physical reduction.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive topic article exploring how major consciousness theories (IIT, GNWT) fail to explain experienced duration—the gap between sub-300ms functional moments and multi-second temporal flow. Argued that temporal phenomenology resists physical reduction, supporting Dualism tenet. Connected to quantum framework via collapse duration and retrocausality providing retention-protention structure. ~2600 words.
- **Output**: obsidian/topics/time-perception-consciousness-theories.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Cross-review decoherence.md considering quantum decoherence objection analysis
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/quantum-decoherence-objection.md distinguishes between basis selection (what decoherence explains) and outcome selection (what it doesn't explain), providing conceptual clarity on why decoherence doesn't solve the measurement problem. The decoherence.md article should reference this analysis and clarify that even after decoherence, the measurement problem persists—consciousness could bias outcomes at this point.
- **Result**: Added wikilink to quantum-decoherence-objection article in Tegmark-Hameroff debate section, expanded basis/outcome selection distinction in "What Decoherence Does Not Do" section, added magnetoreception as proof-of-principle emphasizing that evolution can harness quantum coherence when selection pressure favors it, added to Further Reading section, and added to related_articles frontmatter. The integration clarifies that even if decoherence rapidly suppresses superpositions, consciousness can still bias outcome selection—the measurement problem persists.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/decoherence.md

### ✓ 2026-01-22: Cross-review quantum-consciousness.md considering quantum decoherence objection analysis
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/quantum-decoherence-objection.md provides comprehensive analysis of Tegmark vs. Hameroff calculations (7 orders of magnitude difference), avian magnetoreception as proof-of-principle for biological quantum effects, and crucial distinction that decoherence explains basis selection but not outcome selection. The quantum-consciousness.md article should integrate this defense against the primary scientific objection to quantum theories of consciousness.
- **Result**: Integrated references to quantum-decoherence-objection article in three places: main decoherence challenge section (replacing generic decoherence link with specific new article), emphasis on basis selection vs outcome selection distinction in the "Why Decoherence Doesn't Close the Door" section, and addition to Further Reading section. Added quantum-decoherence-objection to related_articles frontmatter. The integration ensures readers encounter the comprehensive defense against the decoherence objection at appropriate points.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/quantum-consciousness.md

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Cross-review epiphenomenalism.md considering consciousness-as-intelligence-amplifier evidence
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article topics/consciousness-as-intelligence-amplifier.md presents evolutionary argument against epiphenomenalism: if consciousness is causally inert, it cannot have been selected for, yet phenomenal character systematically tracks adaptive value (pain feels bad because damage is bad). The epiphenomenalism.md article's evolutionary objection could be strengthened by connecting this specific evidence plus the working memory expansion (2±1 in apes vs 7±2 in humans) that suggests consciousness amplifies rather than accompanies cognition.
- **Result**: Added systematic phenomenal tracking argument to evolutionary objection section (lines 100-106). Strengthened the explanation of why epiphenomenalism struggles to explain the correlation between phenomenal character and adaptive value, with specific examples (pain/pleasure, mild hunger vs severe injury). Added wikilink to consciousness-as-intelligence-amplifier article.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/epiphenomenalism.md

### ✓ 2026-01-22: Cross-review interactionist-dualism.md considering consciousness-as-intelligence-amplifier evidence
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article topics/consciousness-as-intelligence-amplifier.md presents evolutionary argument (consciousness must have causal effects to be selected), empirical evidence (logical reasoning requires conscious processing), great ape-human gap (working memory 2±1 vs 7±2), and cumulative culture hypothesis. Strong support for Bidirectional Interaction tenet—epiphenomenal consciousness cannot explain why it evolved or why phenomenal character correlates with adaptive value. The interactionist-dualism.md article should integrate this as key evidence against epiphenomenalism.
- **Result**: Added new section "Consciousness Amplifies Intelligence" after the cumulative case arguments, enhanced Argument 6 (self-stultification) with evolutionary evidence showing why phenomenal consciousness cannot be epiphenomenal, integrated key findings (logical reasoning depends on consciousness, working memory expansion 2±1 vs 7±2, metacognitive monitoring enables cumulative culture, flexible response to novel situations), added wikilink to consciousness-as-intelligence-amplifier in related_articles frontmatter.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/interactionist-dualism.md (revised)

### ✓ 2026-01-22: Cross-review phenomenal-unity.md considering quantum binding experimental evidence
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/quantum-binding-experimental-evidence.md provides concrete experimental support for quantum mechanisms underlying phenomenal unity. The phenomenal-unity.md article discusses the theoretical problem of how distributed neural activity produces unified experience but could be strengthened by connecting the experimental evidence: entanglement signatures correlating with consciousness, decoherence timescales compatible with neural processing.
- **Result**: Enhanced experimental evidence section with direct wikilink to quantum-binding-experimental-evidence.md, added specific details (Cohen's d = 1.9 effect size for microtubule-anesthesia finding, Q coefficient variance 31.6% from twin study), clarified that classical mechanisms cannot explain microtubule stabilization effect, integrated Baum's relativistic causality argument, and strengthened conclusion to note three converging lines of evidence (pharmacological, imaging, physical constraints). Added quantum-binding-experimental-evidence to Further Reading section.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/phenomenal-unity.md (revised)

### ✓ 2026-01-22: Write concept article on agent causation and libertarian free will
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Based on research/agent-causation-libertarian-free-will-2026-01-14.md. Agent causation is the view that conscious agents as persisting substances directly cause actions without this being reducible to prior events. Addresses the luck objection to libertarianism. Contemporary defenders include Chisholm, O'Connor, Clarke, Lowe, Hasker. Aligns naturally with the Map's framework—consciousness selecting quantum outcomes is a specific implementation of agent-causal libertarianism. Directly supports Bidirectional Interaction and Dualism tenets by requiring irreducible agency.
- **Result**: Article already exists at obsidian/concepts/agent-causation.md (created 2026-01-15, last deep-reviewed 2026-01-20). The article is comprehensive (10,000+ words) covering: the distinction between agent and event causation, major defenders (Chisholm, O'Connor, Lowe, Hasker), the luck objection and Map's response, substance causation framework, quantum selection mechanism, voluntary attention as paradigm case, motor selection parallels, skill delegation, and creative generation. The task was marked complete because the research has been fully synthesized into the existing article.

### ✓ 2026-01-22: Write concept article on quantum decoherence objection and responses
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Based on research/quantum-decoherence-objection-responses-2026-01-15.md. Tegmark's "warm, wet, and noisy" objection is the most serious scientific challenge to quantum consciousness theories. Research covers Hameroff-Penrose responses (corrected calculations showing 7 orders of magnitude longer coherence), protective mechanisms (Debye layer screening, actin gel ordering), empirical evidence from photosynthesis FMO complex, and revised timescale requirements. Critical for defending Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive 1,400-word concept article explaining Tegmark's critique, Hameroff's corrected calculations (10^-5 to 10^-4 seconds vs. Tegmark's 10^-13 to 10^-20 seconds), revised timescale requirements (10^-7 seconds for 10 MHz Orch OR), avian magnetoreception as proof-of-principle that evolution can harness quantum effects, and crucial point that decoherence explains basis selection but not outcome selection—measurement problem persists, leaving room for consciousness to bias outcomes.

### ✓ 2026-01-22: Cross-review binding-problem.md considering quantum binding experimental evidence
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/quantum-binding-experimental-evidence.md provides three lines of experimental evidence (pharmacological, imaging, physics) supporting quantum binding. The binding-problem.md article discusses the theoretical problem but should now connect these specific experimental findings: microtubule-stabilizing drugs delaying anesthesia (Cohen's d = 1.9), MRI detecting entanglement signatures correlating with consciousness, decoherence times 7 orders longer than Tegmark claimed.
- **Result**: Added wikilinks and specific connections to quantum-binding-experimental-evidence.md throughout binding-problem.md. Connected Wiest et al. microtubule study to Orch OR predictions, noted entanglement-working memory correlation suggests functional role in cognition (not just passive byproduct), linked Baum's quantum binding argument to Bell's theorem demonstrating non-local correlations are exclusively quantum, and emphasized that classical coordination cannot produce ontological holism. Article already had comprehensive quantum binding coverage; cross-review strengthened integration with new dedicated experimental evidence article.

### ✓ 2026-01-22: Write arguments page for positive case for dualism
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Based on research/arguments-for-dualism-positive-case-2026-01-14.md. Comprehensive research covering conceivability argument (zombies), knowledge argument (Mary's Room), qualia arguments, unity of consciousness (Hasker), and intentionality. Contemporary defenders include Chalmers, Swinburne, Hasker, Lowe, Rickabaugh & Moreland. 2020 PhilPapers survey shows 22% of philosophers accept dualism. The Map extensively argues against materialism but lacks systematic positive case. Directly supports Dualism tenet.
- **Result**: Article already exists as comprehensive 7000+ word concept page at obsidian/concepts/arguments-for-dualism.md (created 2026-01-14, last deep-reviewed 2026-01-20). Contains all requested content: conceivability argument, knowledge argument, qualia arguments, unity of consciousness, intentionality, parsimony response, folk error response, illusionism challenge, and full tenet alignment. The research has been fully consumed.

### ✓ 2026-01-22: Fix question-begging in evolutionary argument in consciousness-as-intelligence-amplifier.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review found high-severity issue: evolutionary argument assumes epiphenomenalism requires "coincidence" between phenomenal character and adaptive value, but this only follows if phenomenal consciousness is ontologically separate from neural correlates (which is what's in dispute). Restructure: first argue for explanatory gap/ontological separation, then use evolutionary argument as additional support.
- **Result**: Restructured article to first establish the explanatory gap (new section "Why Phenomenal Consciousness Is Not Reducible to Neural Activity") before presenting the evolutionary argument. New section argues that phenomenal properties (qualia) resist functional analysis, discusses hard problem and multiple physicalist responses, and establishes ontological separation. Evolutionary argument section now explicitly states it depends on this prior argument and includes concrete analogy (electromagnetic hum) to illustrate why epiphenomenal byproducts wouldn't systematically track adaptive value. Makes clear throughout that evolutionary case only works given ontological gap.
- **Output**: obsidian/topics/consciousness-as-intelligence-amplifier.md (revised)

### ✓ 2026-01-22: Address equivocation on "consciousness" in consciousness-as-intelligence-amplifier.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (pessimistic-2026-01-22-evening.md) found high-severity issue: article uses "consciousness" to mean three different things without distinguishing them: (1) phenomenal consciousness (what-it's-like), (2) access consciousness (global availability), (3) executive function/working memory. Evidence for (2)/(3) is presented as evidence for (1). Add section distinguishing these senses and clarify which evidence supports which sense.
- **Result**: Added comprehensive "Three Senses of Consciousness" section distinguishing phenomenal consciousness (what-it's-like), access consciousness (global information availability), and executive function/working memory. Revised evolutionary argument to acknowledge circularity and show it depends on accepting explanatory gap first. Updated cognitive load section to clarify evidence supports access/executive consciousness primarily. Revised working memory discussion to acknowledge connection to phenomenal consciousness is speculative. Updated AI section and Relation to Site Perspective to carefully distinguish what evidence establishes. Article now argues more precisely about which aspects of consciousness amplify intelligence and what remains to be established.
- **Output**: obsidian/topics/consciousness-as-intelligence-amplifier.md (revised)

### ✓ 2026-01-22: Write article on consciousness as intelligence amplifier
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Based on research/consciousness-influence-intelligence-2026-01-21.md. Strong evidence that consciousness enables flexible responses, logical reasoning, counterfactual thinking, metacognitive monitoring. Evolutionary argument: consciousness couldn't have evolved if epiphenomenal. Working memory expansion (2±1 in apes vs 7±2 in humans) may reflect consciousness expansion. Directly supports Bidirectional Interaction tenet.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive 3400-word topic article exploring how consciousness amplifies intelligence through flexible deployment, metacognitive monitoring, logical reasoning, counterfactual thinking, and cumulative culture. Synthesized evolutionary argument (consciousness must have causal effects to be selected), empirical evidence (logical reasoning requires conscious processing), great ape-human gap (working memory 2±1 vs 7±2), and cumulative culture hypothesis. Strong support for Bidirectional Interaction tenet—epiphenomenal consciousness cannot explain why it evolved or why phenomenal character correlates with adaptive value.

### ✓ 2026-01-22: Deep review jourdain-hypothesis.md
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: AI-generated concept article (ai_contribution: 100) has never been deep-reviewed. The Jourdain hypothesis (consciousness as a necessary condition for memory formation) is a unique perspective on consciousness-memory relationships.
- **Result**: Comprehensive review addressing critical issues (question-begging on phenomenology requirement, missing falsification condition, underdeveloped tip-of-the-tongue analysis) and adding enhancements (moral agency subsection, quantum binding connection, strengthened functionalist response). Article now argues why metarepresentation requires phenomenology (phenomenal character as marker), includes unconscious metarepresentation as falsifier, expands tip-of-the-tongue as paradigm case, connects to free will and quantum coherence mechanisms.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/jourdain-hypothesis.md (revised), obsidian/reviews/deep-review-2026-01-22-jourdain-hypothesis.md

### ✓ 2026-01-22: Write article on neural binding quantum experimental evidence
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Based on research/neural-binding-quantum-entanglement-2026-01-19.md. Recent 2024-2025 breakthrough evidence: microtubule-stabilizing drugs delay anesthesia (Cohen's d = 1.9), MRI detects entanglement signatures correlating with consciousness, decoherence times 7 orders longer than Tegmark claimed. Directly supports Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet with experimental validation.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive 1800-word concept article synthesizing three lines of experimental evidence (pharmacological, imaging, physics) supporting quantum binding hypothesis.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/quantum-binding-experimental-evidence.md

### ✓ 2026-01-22: Create concept page for phenomenal-consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Gap analysis—the complement to access-consciousness in Block's framework. Referenced in emotional-consciousness.md. Core to Dualism tenet—phenomenal consciousness is precisely what physicalism cannot explain. The hard problem: why there's something it's like to be conscious. Foundation for qualia arguments, zombie arguments, explanatory gap.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive concept article (~6,800 words) defining P-consciousness as the "what it's like" aspect of experience—the subjective, experiential quality accompanying perception, thought, emotion. Covered Block's access/phenomenal distinction showing what physicalist theories can (access mechanisms) vs. cannot (phenomenology) explain. Major sections: definition and core features, relationship to qualia, the hard problem (existence and character questions), zombie argument, knowledge argument, inverted qualia scenarios, phenomenal concept strategy with Chalmers's master argument (dilemmatic response to physicalist conceptual gap strategy), illusionism and self-refutation objection. Strongly supports Dualism tenet (irreducibility of phenomenal properties) and Bidirectional Interaction tenet (causal efficacy vs. epiphenomenalism's self-stultification). Argued that acknowledging access-consciousness strengthens dualism by isolating what physical explanations can explain (access) from what they cannot (phenomenology)—the residual explanatory gap is where dualism finds strongest support. Engaged phenomenal concept strategy seriously as strongest physicalist response but argued Chalmers's master argument reveals deep problems. Rejected illusionism as denying what is most directly known.

### ✓ 2026-01-22: Create concept page for access-consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Gap analysis—Ned Block's foundational distinction between access consciousness (A-consciousness: information globally available) and phenomenal consciousness (P-consciousness: what it's like). Referenced in baseline-cognition.md. Critical for Bidirectional Interaction tenet—distinguishes what consciousness does from what consciousness is. Supports arguments against functionalism.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive concept article (~7,000 words) defining Block's 1995 distinction and its implications for dualism. Covered definition, access/phenomenal distinction, dissociations (blindsight without phenomenology, overflow argument for phenomenology exceeding access), relationship to functionalism and Global Workspace Theory, role of attention as selection mechanism, connection to dualist interaction via Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism, full tenet alignment. Argued that A-consciousness is functionally explicable while P-consciousness remains irreducible, strengthening dualism by isolating what physicalism can vs. cannot explain.

Metaphysical foundation for identity persistence across time. Appears in philosophy-of-time.md, quantum-consciousness.md, phenomenal-value-realism.md.
- **Result**: Task already completed—comprehensive article exists as obsidian/concepts/haecceity.md (~6,700 words, created 2026-01-16, last deep-reviewed 2026-01-20). Contains Duns Scotus origins, haecceitism vs anti-haecceitism debate, connection to MWI indexical problem, pairing problem response, Parfit convergence, teleportation/uploading scenarios, Buddhist and process philosophy perspectives, illusionist challenge, and full tenet alignment. Article is already published (draft: false) and extensively cross-linked across 138 files on the Map.

### ✓ 2026-01-23: Write article on altered states of consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Based on research/altered-states-consciousness-2026-01-19.md (2867 words). Covers meditation, psychedelics, sleep, anesthesia. Bridge to Eastern philosophy and phenomenology. Fills significant experiential gap—normal waking consciousness is only one mode. Connects to phenomenology.md, neurophenomenology.md, eastern.md.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive topic article (~2,400 words) arguing that altered states reveal consciousness operates in multiple modes, not a simple on-off switch. Emphasized filter theory framework—psychedelics loosen the filter, anesthesia tightens it, meditation voluntarily modulates it. Covered voluntary vs. involuntary alterations, cessation events, flow states, quantum consciousness implications. Argued that divergence between behavior and experience (identical outputs, different conscious states) undermines identity theories and supports transmission model over production model.
- **Output**: obsidian/topics/altered-states-consciousness.md

### ✓ 2026-01-22: Write article on emotional consciousness and valence
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Based on research/emotional-consciousness-valence-2026-01-19.md (3176 words). Comprehensive treatment of emotions and phenomenal consciousness—significant gap in current Map coverage. Connects to qualia.md, phenomenal-consciousness.md, intentionality.md. Explores whether emotions require consciousness or can be purely physical responses.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive article (~3,800 words) arguing that emotional consciousness and valence (positive/negative felt quality) are irreducible phenomenal properties. Used pain asymbolia as key evidence—patients can represent damage without feeling badness, proving the phenomenal property does causal work. Covered Panksepp vs. LeDoux debate, core affect theory, explanatory gap for valence, and moral status implications. Strongly supports Dualism (valence as intrinsic quale), Bidirectional Interaction (felt badness motivates), and phenomenal-value-realism.
- **Output**: obsidian/topics/emotional-consciousness.md

### ✓ 2026-01-22: Create concept page for witness-consciousness

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Based on research/consciousness-independent-baseline-cognition-2026-01-21.md (2796 words). Explores whether consciousness is necessary for cognition or merely modulates it. Directly supports Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet by articulating baseline vs. consciousness-enhanced processing. Relates to binding-problem.md, access-consciousness.md, cognitive-phenomenology.md.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive article (1900+ words) exploring great ape cognition as baseline for what neurons can do without consciousness. Argued that human cognitive leap (logical reasoning, counterfactual thinking, cumulative culture, metarepresentation) requires consciousness as causal amplifier. Supports Bidirectional Interaction tenet by showing consciousness is causally necessary for human-level intelligence, not epiphenomenal.

### ✓ 2026-01-22: Cross-review causal-closure.md considering quantum response
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: The stapp-quantum-mind.md article (2026-01-22) presents a concrete response to causal closure: consciousness operates at quantum indeterminacies where physics leaves outcomes undetermined, so no conservation laws are violated. The causal-closure.md article discusses the principle but could be strengthened by connecting this specific quantum-based response and noting that the exclusion problem is addressed by consciousness operating where physics is "silent."
- **Result**: Added new "Stapp's Quantum Response" subsection (~350 words) making the connection between Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism and the causal closure objection explicit. The section details four key features: (1) operates where physics is silent at indeterminacies, (2) no energy injection via repeated observation, (3) complementary determination (physics provides probabilities, consciousness provides particularity), (4) phenomenologically grounded in James's effort phenomenology. This elevates the Stapp mechanism from a passing mention to a prominent response that directly addresses the exclusion problem.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/causal-closure.md

### ✓ 2026-01-22: Create arguments page for epiphenomenalism
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: The arguments/epiphenomenalism page is referenced 15 times across mental-causation.md, the arguments index, and reviews, but doesn't exist.

### ✓ 2026-01-22: Cross-review mental-effort.md considering Stapp phenomenology
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/stapp-quantum-mind.md (2026-01-22) connects effort phenomenology (via William James) to quantum Zeno observation rate. The mental-effort.md article covers effort but should now link to the comprehensive Stapp treatment and may benefit from the willed-instructed-exogenous distinction that explains why different types of attention feel differently effortful.
- **Result**: Added stapp-quantum-mind to concepts frontmatter (top position). Added reference to dedicated Stapp article at start of quantum Zeno section with pointer to comprehensive treatment including von Neumann formalism, Schwartz neuroplasticity, and two-modes finding. Added stapp-quantum-mind to top of Further Reading with description.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/mental-effort.md

### ✓ 2026-01-22: Cross-review interactionist-dualism.md considering Stapp mechanism
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/stapp-quantum-mind.md (2026-01-22) provides the most concrete mechanism for how consciousness might interact with the physical brain without violating conservation laws. The interactionist-dualism.md article could be strengthened by connecting Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism as the leading candidate for how bidirectional interaction actually works—and how it addresses the causal closure objection.
- **Result**: Expanded Stapp's Quantum Zeno Approach section from ~11 lines to ~25 lines with link to dedicated article, 4-step mechanism summary, Schwartz neuroplasticity evidence, and willed-instructed neural distinction. Added paragraph in Causal Closure section connecting Stapp as concrete articulation of the Map's response. Added stapp-quantum-mind to top of Further Reading.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/interactionist-dualism.md

### ✓ 2026-01-22: Cross-review quantum-consciousness.md considering Stapp article
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/stapp-quantum-mind.md (2026-01-22) provides comprehensive treatment of Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism. The quantum-consciousness.md overview article should now reference the dedicated Stapp article and may benefit from connecting the two-modes-of-consciousness finding (active selection vs passive witnessing) and the Schwartz neuroplasticity evidence.
- **Result**: Added stapp-quantum-mind to concepts frontmatter and top of Further Reading. Added reference to dedicated Stapp article at start of Quantum Zeno Effect section with summary of key topics covered. Updated "Evidence from Meditation" subsection title to "Two Modes of Consciousness" and added cross-reference to stapp-quantum-mind article for detailed treatment. Added new "willed-instructed distinction" paragraph (~100 words) explaining the three modes of attention (exogenous, instructed, willed) with distinct neural signatures as evidence supporting Stapp's framework.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/quantum-consciousness.md

### ✓ 2026-01-22: Cross-review metarepresentation.md considering theory-of-mind hierarchy
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: The recently expanded theory-of-mind.md (2026-01-22) presents Levels 0-3+ hierarchy with metarepresentational threshold between Levels 1 and 2. The metarepresentation.md article could be strengthened by explicitly mapping the ToM levels to metarepresentational demands—Level 2 requires representing beliefs AS beliefs (first-order metarepresentation), Level 3 requires representing others' metarepresentations (second-order).
- **Result**: Added new "Theory of Mind Levels and Metarepresentational Demands" subsection (~350 words) explaining how Levels 0-1 may operate without metarepresentation while Level 2 introduces first-order metarepresentation (representing beliefs AS beliefs) and Level 3+ requires second-order metarepresentation (nested attribution). Connected working memory demands (2±1 vs 7±2 items) to where the threshold falls. Added theory-of-mind to concepts frontmatter and top of Further Reading.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/metarepresentation.md

### ✓ 2026-01-22: Cross-review phenomenology-of-choice.md considering motor-selection insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Article concepts/motor-selection.md (deep-reviewed 2026-01-21) presents the quantum Zeno mechanism for how attention sustains one motor pattern over competitors. The phenomenology-of-choice.md article discusses the felt sense of choosing but could be strengthened by connecting the specific mechanism—the "effort of will" phenomenology may reflect repeated attention that stabilizes superposition toward one outcome.
- **Result**: Added new "Motor Selection as Paradigm Case" subsection (~450 words) under the Effort as Evidence section. Connected the 300ms decision window to the phenomenology of "gathering oneself" to act, explained how frontal theta/bidirectional coherence signatures provide third-person validation for first-person effort phenomenology, described the basal ganglia brake-release architecture as the interface where phenomenal effort operates, and cited the Desmurget double dissociation showing that intention phenomenology is separable from motor execution.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/phenomenology-of-choice.md

### ✓ 2026-01-22: Write article on Hoel's continual learning argument for LLM consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/hoel-llm-consciousness-continual-learning-2026-01-15.md. Erik Hoel argues LLMs lack consciousness specifically because they don't engage in continual learning during inference. This provides a concrete falsifiable criterion distinguishing conscious from non-conscious systems. Currently referenced in continual-learning-argument.md but could be expanded with full context. Builds on ai-consciousness.md, consciousness-as-amplifier.md, substrate-independence-critique.md.
- **Result**: Task auto-completed—comprehensive article already exists as concepts/continual-learning-argument.md (~2200 words). Research note content fully incorporated into both this dedicated article and ai-consciousness.md. Covers: proximity argument, falsifiability-non-triviality dilemma, continual learning criterion, mechanism gap, illusionist challenge, process philosophy perspective, contemplative evidence, decoherence challenge, and full tenet alignment.

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/stapp-mental-effort-mind-matter-2026-01-14.md. Henry Stapp's model provides the most detailed mechanism for consciousness-quantum interaction via the quantum Zeno effect. His work directly supports the Minimal Quantum Interaction and Bidirectional Interaction tenets. Currently referenced in mental-effort.md and attention-as-interface.md but no dedicated article. Builds on quantum-consciousness.md, mental-effort.md, motor-selection.md.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive concept article (~2800 words) covering: the core mechanism (orthodox quantum mechanics, quantum Zeno effect, no energy injection), William James on effort phenomenology, the willed-instructed distinction, Schwartz's OCD neuroplasticity research, attention-as-interface extension, two modes of consciousness (active selection vs passive witnessing), objections and responses (decoherence, formalism, illusionist challenge), Process Philosophy perspective, and full tenet alignment.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/stapp-quantum-mind.md

### ✓ 2026-01-22: Cross-review ai-consciousness.md considering theory-of-mind insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/theory-of-mind.md (2026-01-22) presents the metarepresentational threshold—Levels 0-1 may operate without consciousness while Level 3+ requires it. The ai-consciousness.md article discusses whether AI systems are conscious but could be strengthened by applying the ToM levels framework: do LLMs demonstrate genuine Level 2+ theory of mind or sophisticated Level 1 behaviour reading? This provides concrete testable predictions.
- **Result**: Added new "Theory of Mind Levels and the Metarepresentational Threshold" subsection (~450 words) in the AI Metacognition section covering: where LLMs succeed (Level 2 test performance), why this performance is misleading (the nested binding requirement for genuine Level 3), testable predictions (competence-performance gaps, adversarial examples, structural sensitivity), and the conclusion that LLMs operate linguistically at Level 3+ while cognitively remaining at Level 0. Added theory-of-mind to concepts frontmatter and top of Further Reading.

### ✓ 2026-01-22: Cross-review problem-of-other-minds.md considering theory-of-mind insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/theory-of-mind.md (2026-01-22) presents the levels hierarchy (Level 0-3+) for theory of mind capacities. The problem-of-other-minds.md article discusses how we know other minds exist but could be strengthened by connecting the ToM levels framework—our confidence that others have minds may track our ToM level: Level 1 (perceptual) gives weaker grounds than Level 3 (recursive) which enables rich mutual modelling.
- **Result**: Added new "Theory of Mind and Epistemic Confidence" section (~450 words) explaining how ToM levels track epistemic confidence in other minds, the argument that Level 3 ToM requires metarepresentation which requires consciousness, and how this strengthens the discourse argument. Added theory-of-mind and metarepresentation to concepts frontmatter and top of Further Reading.

### ✓ 2026-01-22: Cross-review self-and-consciousness.md considering unobservable-self insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New voids article voids/the-unobservable-self.md (2026-01-22) explores why the observing self cannot observe itself observing—the regression of attention reveals a structural feature of consciousness. The self-and-consciousness.md article discusses minimal self and narrative self but could be strengthened by connecting the unobservable self as a third dimension: the self that does the observing is structurally inaccessible in a way that differs from both the pre-reflective minimal self and the reflective narrative self.
- **Result**: Added new "The Unobservable Observer" subsection (~500 words) after the Three Layers of Selfhood table explaining: the fourth dimension cutting across all three layers, how it differs from minimal/metacognitive/narrative distinctions, a table showing what escapes observation at each layer, connection to Hume's observation, implications for the hard problem, and reference to witness consciousness traditions. Added the-unobservable-self to concepts frontmatter and top of Further Reading.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/self-and-consciousness.md

### ✓ 2026-01-22: Cross-review metacognition.md considering consciousness-and-social-cognition insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/consciousness-and-social-cognition.md (2026-01-22) argues that explicit theory of mind (Level 2+) requires consciousness because it involves metacognitive operations on one's own and others' mental states. The metacognition.md article could be strengthened by adding social metacognition as a domain—monitoring and reasoning about others' mental states, not just one's own.
- **Result**: Added new "Social Metacognition: Thinking About Others' Thinking" section (~700 words) covering: theory of mind as social metacognition with Level 0-3 comparison table, the nested binding requirement for recursive social cognition, empathy as affective social metacognition (contagion → cognitive empathy → empathic concern), and implications for the consciousness-metacognition relationship. Added consciousness-and-social-cognition, theory-of-mind, emotional-consciousness, phenomenal-unity, and working-memory to concepts frontmatter and top of Further Reading.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/metacognition.md

### ✓ 2026-01-22: Write concept article on theory of mind
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: The theory of mind concept is central to consciousness-and-social-cognition.md (which details the 4-level hierarchy) but has no dedicated article. ToM is referenced across animal-consciousness.md, metarepresentation.md, and jourdain-hypothesis.md. A dedicated concept page would cover: definition and levels, developmental trajectory, neural correlates, relation to consciousness (metarepresentational requirement), and animal cognition evidence. Builds on consciousness-and-social-cognition.md, metarepresentation.md, baseline-cognition.md.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive concept article (~2400 words) covering: definition and the 4-level hierarchy (Level 0-3+), the metarepresentational threshold argument, developmental trajectory from joint attention through recursive false belief, neural correlates (mPFC, TPJ, pSTS, precuneus), great ape evidence and limitations, AI theory of mind analysis, illusionist challenge response, and full tenet alignment with Bidirectional Interaction, Dualism, Minimal Quantum Interaction, and Occam's Razor.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/theory-of-mind.md

### ✓ 2026-01-22: Cross-review jourdain-hypothesis.md considering consciousness-and-social-cognition insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/consciousness-and-social-cognition.md (2026-01-22) provides evidence that social cognition requiring metarepresentation (explicit theory of mind, shared intentionality) depends on consciousness. The jourdain-hypothesis.md article argues great apes have cognition without knowing they have it—social cognition offers a concrete domain where this procedural/declarative distinction manifests clearly.
- **Result**: Added new "Social Cognition: Where the Jourdain Distinction Is Clearest" section (~450 words) showing how the 4-level theory of mind hierarchy maps onto the procedural/declarative distinction, how shared intentionality illuminates the transition through recursive mutual awareness, and how the empathy gradient (contagion → cognitive empathy → empathic concern) tracks the same distinction. Added consciousness-and-social-cognition to concepts frontmatter and top of Further Reading.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/jourdain-hypothesis.md

### ✓ 2026-01-22: Cross-review baseline-cognition.md considering consciousness-and-social-cognition insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/consciousness-and-social-cognition.md (2026-01-22) provides detailed analysis of what social cognition achieves without consciousness (the primate baseline) versus with consciousness (human social cognition). The baseline-cognition.md article could be strengthened by adding social cognition as a domain where the baseline/conscious distinction is particularly clear.
- **Result**: Added new "Social Cognition: Where the Gap Is Clearest" subsection (~350 words) showing social cognition as paradigm case of the baseline/conscious distinction. Covered the 4-level theory of mind hierarchy (Levels 0-1 in baseline, Level 3 requires consciousness), shared intentionality and joint attention's recursive mutual awareness, and the empathy component stratification (contagion → cognitive empathy → empathic concern). Added consciousness-and-social-cognition to concepts frontmatter and top of Further Reading.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/baseline-cognition.md

### ✓ 2026-01-22: Cross-review animal-consciousness.md considering consciousness-and-social-cognition insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/consciousness-and-social-cognition.md (2026-01-22) argues that the gap between great ape and human social cognition tracks consciousness—phenomenal experience enables the metarepresentational operations underlying shared intentionality, explicit theory of mind, and recursive mindreading. The animal-consciousness.md topic could be strengthened by connecting these specific cognitive markers as evidence for the consciousness gap.
- **Result**: Added new "Social Cognition and Theory of Mind Levels" subsection (~250 words) covering the 4-level theory of mind hierarchy, explaining how Levels 0-1 operate within baseline cognition while Level 3 requires consciousness for nested representation manipulation. Connected shared intentionality (recursive mutual awareness) and empathy hierarchy (contagion → cognitive empathy → empathic concern) as evidence for the consciousness gap. Added consciousness-and-social-cognition, metarepresentation, and working-memory to concepts frontmatter and Further Reading.
- **Output**: obsidian/topics/animal-consciousness.md

### ✓ 2026-01-22: Cross-review temporal-consciousness.md considering temporal-structure-of-understanding insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/temporal-structure-of-understanding.md (2026-01-22) provides specific evidence for how temporal phenomenology enables cognitive functions like understanding. The temporal-consciousness.md article could be strengthened by adding understanding as a case where temporal structure does constitutive work—not just accompanying cognition but enabling it.
- **Result**: Added new "Understanding as Temporal Achievement" subsection (~300 words) showing how temporal consciousness enables understanding through the click phenomenon, working memory manipulation, and phenomenal guidance. Connected to Bidirectional Interaction tenet. Added temporal-structure-of-understanding, working-memory, and cognitive-phenomenology to concepts frontmatter and Further Reading.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/temporal-consciousness.md

### ✓ 2026-01-22: Cross-review cognitive-phenomenology.md considering temporal-structure insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/temporal-structure-of-understanding.md (2026-01-22) explores how understanding unfolds through time—the click of insight, gradual emergence, incubation-insight patterns. The cognitive-phenomenology.md article could be strengthened by connecting temporal phenomenology as evidence for cognitive phenomenology: the fact that understanding has characteristic temporal structure supports the view that thinking has irreducible phenomenal character.
- **Result**: Added new "The Temporal Structure of Understanding" subsection (~400 words) connecting temporal phenomenology to cognitive phenomenology evidence. Covered the click as non-sensory, gradual emergence phenomenology, temporal binding supporting cognitive phenomenology, and incubation-insight revealing phenomenal contribution. Added temporal-structure-of-understanding and specious-present to concepts frontmatter and Further Reading.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/cognitive-phenomenology.md

### ✓ 2026-01-22: Write article on consciousness and social cognition
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-01-22 (medium priority). The relationship between consciousness and advanced social cognition. Theory of mind, empathy, social prediction—do these require phenomenal consciousness? Great apes have some social cognition; humans have more. Does the gap track consciousness? Builds on animal-consciousness.md, jourdain-hypothesis.md, minimal-consciousness.md.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive concepts article (~2800 words) covering: theory of mind levels (0-3), the metarepresentational threshold for social cognition, shared intentionality and joint attention, empathy components (contagion, cognitive, concern), AI social cognition analysis, illusionist challenge with empathy and recursion responses, contemplative perspectives on compassion cultivation, Process Philosophy on prehending subjects, and full tenet alignment with Bidirectional Interaction, Dualism, Minimal Quantum Interaction, and Occam's Razor.
