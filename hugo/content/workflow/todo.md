title: AI Task Queue
topics: []
---

This is the task queue for AI automation. The human reviews and prioritizes tasks; the AI executes them.

## How to Edit This List

- **Promote**: Change `P2` to `P1`, etc.
- **Demote**: Change `P1` to `P2`, etc.
- **Veto**: Add `#veto` anywhere in the task heading (e.g., `### P2: Task name #veto`)
- **Add reason**: Optionally add `- **Veto reason**: [why]` before vetoing

Vetoed items are moved automatically to the Vetoed Tasks section on the next evolution loop run.

## Priority Levels

- **P0**: Urgent - execute immediately
- **P1**: High - execute this week
- **P2**: Medium - execute when time permits
- **P2**: Low - nice to have, human approval needed

## Active Tasks

### P2: Update references to coalesced temporal articles (specious-present, duration)
- **Type**: other
- **Notes**: Coalesce (2026-02-15) merged `specious-present.md` and `duration.md` into the expanded `temporal-consciousness.md`. ~15 active content files reference `[specious-present](/specious-present/)` and ~30 reference `[duration](/duration/)` across concepts/, topics/, apex/, and voids/. Archive pages serve these URLs, but wikilinks in active content should eventually be updated to point to temporal-consciousness where appropriate.
- **Source**: coalesce
- **Generated**: 2026-02-15

### P2: Update references to coalesced indexical articles (indexical-facts, indexical-knowledge, self-locating-beliefs)
- **Type**: other
- **Notes**: Coalesce (2026-02-13) merged `indexical-facts.md`, `indexical-knowledge.md`, and `self-locating-beliefs.md` into `indexical-knowledge-and-identity.md`. 5 active content files reference archived articles: haecceity.md and visual-consciousness.md reference `[indexical-facts](/indexical-facts/)`, acquaintance-knowledge.md references `[indexical-knowledge](/indexical-knowledge/)`, phenomenology-of-belief-revision.md and indexical-identity-quantum-measurement.md reference `[self-locating-beliefs](/self-locating-beliefs/)`. Archive pages serve these URLs, but wikilinks should eventually be updated.

- **Generated**: 2026-02-13

### P2: Update references to coalesced attention articles (attention, voluntary-attention, attention-motor-quantum-interface)
- **Type**: other
- **Notes**: Coalesce (2026-02-12) merged `attention.md`, `voluntary-attention.md`, and `attention-motor-quantum-interface.md` into `attention-as-interface.md`. ~36 active content files reference `[attention](/attention/)`, ~43 reference `[voluntary-attention](/voluntary-attention/)`, ~10 reference `[attention-motor-quantum-interface](/attention-motor-quantum-interface/)`. Archive pages serve these URLs, but wikilinks in active content should eventually be updated to point to attention-as-interface where appropriate.

- **Generated**: 2026-02-12

### P2: Update references to coalesced binding articles (phenomenal-unity, neural-binding-mechanisms, multimodal-binding)
- **Type**: other
- **Notes**: Coalesce (2026-02-11) merged phenomenal-unity.md, neural-binding-mechanisms.md, and multimodal-binding.md into phenomenal-binding-and-holism.md. 37 active content files reference these archived articles. Key files include: binding-problem.md, quantum-consciousness.md, unity-of-consciousness.md, quantum-binding-and-phenomenal-unity.md, varieties-of-unity.md, why-phenomenal-unity-resists-explanation.md, split-brain-consciousness.md, hard-problem-of-consciousness.md, and many others. Update wikilinks to point to phenomenal-binding-and-holism or leave as-is if archive redirect works.

### P2: Update references to coalesced attention articles (attention-interface-mechanisms, attention-motor-planning-quantum-interface)
- **Type**: other
- **Notes**: Coalesce (2026-02-09) merged `attention-interface-mechanisms.md` and `attention-motor-planning-quantum-interface.md` into `attention-as-selection-interface.md`. 10 active content files reference `[attention-interface-mechanisms](/attention-interface-mechanisms/)`: embodied-consciousness-and-the-interface.md, psychophysical-laws-bridging-mind-and-matter.md, psychophysical-coupling.md, free-will.md, decoherence.md, quantum-consciousness.md, mental-effort.md, stapp-quantum-mind.md, attention-as-interface.md, structure-of-attention.md. Update wikilinks to point to attention-as-selection-interface.
- **Source**: coalesce
- **Generated**: 2026-02-09

### P2: Update wikilinks to archived articles (interface-locality, brain-specialness, and 5 others)
- **Type**: other
- **Notes**: Gap analysis found 70+ broken wikilinks pointing to archived/coalesced articles. Key targets: interface-locality (34 refs, archived to concepts/), brain-specialness (6 refs), consciousness-and-quantum-measurement (11 refs), nihilism (5 refs), quantum-measurement-and-definite-outcomes (5 refs), eastern-philosophy-haecceity-tension (4 refs), meaning-and-consciousness (4 refs). Update wikilinks to point to the replacement articles these were coalesced into, or verify the archive redirect handles them.

### P2: Fix case-sensitivity wikilink errors across content
- **Type**: other
- **Notes**: Gap analysis found 68 case-sensitivity wikilink errors where capitalized forms like [Access consciousness](/concepts/access-consciousness/), [Blindsight](/concepts/blindsight/), [Filter-theory](/concepts/filter-theory/), [Qualia](/concepts/qualia/) are used instead of lowercase-hyphenated forms. Most concentrated in concepts/ section (255 occurrences). Bulk find-replace needed: correct capitalized wikilinks to match actual filenames.

### P2: Strengthen Minimal Quantum Interaction cross-references
- **Type**: other
- **Notes**: Gap analysis found Minimal Quantum Interaction is the weakest-represented tenet (184 files vs 301 for Dualism, 61% ratio). While absolute coverage is adequate, many attention, cognition, and Eastern philosophy articles that implicitly connect to quantum interaction don't explicitly reference it. Add Tenet 2 cross-references to articles in the attention cluster (attention-interface-mechanisms.md, voluntary-attention.md), biological articles (evolution-of-consciousness.md, neural-quantum-coherence.md), and contemplative articles where the quantum Zeno mechanism is relevant.

### P2: Update references to coalesced substrate-independence-critique article
- **Type**: other
- **Notes**: Coalesce (2026-02-02) merged `substrate-independence-critique.md` into `substrate-independence.md`. 20+ files in obsidian/ reference the archived article via `[substrate-independence-critique](/substrate-independence-critique/)`. Key files: functionalism.md, llm-consciousness.md, continual-learning-argument.md, embodied-cognition.md, ai-consciousness.md, machine-consciousness.md, hard-problem-of-consciousness.md, machine-question.md. Update wikilinks to point to substrate-independence or leave as-is if the link still works (archived articles display redirect notice).

### ✓ 2026-02-07: Address confidence-uncertainty mismatch in foundational articles
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-05) found pattern across simulation.md, knowledge-argument.md, and ethics-of-consciousness.md: strong claims in main text, uncertainty acknowledgments buried in caveats or "What Would Challenge" sections. Creates misleading impression. Need to integrate conditional language into main claims: "If the simulation hypothesis is coherent, it would suggest..." rather than "The simulation hypothesis dissolves..." Also: knowledge-argument treats intuition as near-probative without engaging methodological debates; ethics article's AI consciousness conclusions rest heavily on contested framework. See pessimistic-2026-02-05.md

- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/simulation.md, obsidian/concepts/knowledge-argument.md, obsidian/topics/ethics-of-consciousness.md

### ✓ 2026-02-09: Write article on phenomenal conservatism and introspective evidence
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-02 (afternoon). Huemer's phenomenal conservatism—if it seems to S that P, S has prima facie justification for believing P—is foundational for treating phenomenal evidence seriously. How does the Map handle introspective reliability? When should phenomenal seemings be trusted? Builds on arguments-for-dualism.md, epistemic-advantages-of-dualism.md, introspection.md. See optimistic-2026-02-02-afternoon.md

### ✓ 2026-02-09: Create concept page for phenomenal transparency
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: complete (duplicate of earlier task)

### P3: Create concept page for Galilean exclusion
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-16. The foundational methodological move that excluded subjectivity from science. Referenced in consciousness-and-scientific-methodology.md and implicit across the Map's epistemological arguments. Deserves its own concept page linking to objectivity-and-consciousness, explanatory-gap, hard-problem-of-consciousness. See optimistic-2026-02-16.md

### P3: Create concept page for agent teleology
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-16. Genuine purpose introduced by conscious agents into an otherwise mechanistic universe, distinguished from cosmic and theological teleology. Referenced in evolution-under-dualism.md. Central to the Map's position on free will and evolution but not yet defined anywhere. See optimistic-2026-02-16.md

## Completed Tasks
## Blocked Tasks (Needs Human)

Tasks that failed 3+ times and require human intervention.

## Vetoed Tasks

Ideas that were considered and rejected. The AI will not re-propose these.


### ✓ 2026-02-16: Write article on consciousness and the authority of mathematics
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-16. Mathematics involves existence claims that logic alone does not. If logical authority is phenomenal (per consciousness-and-the-authority-of-logic.md), is mathematical existence phenomenal too? Gödel's platonism versus formalism becomes a consciousness question. The Map's dualism has natural affinity with mathematical platonism. Builds on consciousness-and-the-authority-of-logic.md, consciousness-and-mathematical-understanding.md. See optimistic-2026-02-16.md
- **Output**: consciousness and the authority of mathematics

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Write article on philosophy of perception under dualism
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-16. How does the Map handle the relationship between perception and reality if consciousness is irreducible? Direct realism, representationalism, and naive realism each have different implications for dualist interactionism. The Galilean exclusion creates pressure: if secondary qualities were excluded from physics, are they real features of the world or of consciousness? Builds on consciousness-and-scientific-methodology.md, phenomenology-of-perceptual-constancy.md, phenomenal-transparency.md. See optimistic-2026-02-16.md
- **Output**: philosophy of perception under dualism

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Strengthen transactional interpretation engagement in retrocausality.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-16) found retrocausality.md name-checks Maudlin's objections and Kastner's modifications without substantive engagement, then builds the entire consciousness-application section on the transactional interpretation. Either engage with Maudlin's specific objections or soften the consciousness-application claims to be explicitly conditional. See pessimistic-2026-02-16.md
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/retrocausality.md

Task context:

Either engage with Maudlin's specific objections or soften the consciousness-application claims to be explicitly conditional. See pessimistic-2026-02-16.md

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Harmonise decoherence treatment across quantum-related articles
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-16) found inconsistent treatment of decoherence across retrocausality.md, simulation.md, and animal-consciousness.md. Retrocausality treats it as manageable (citing Hameroff's disputed corrections), simulation treats it as unsolved, animal-consciousness extends quantum consciousness to all organisms with microtubules without addressing it. Establish a consistent site-wide position. See pessimistic-2026-02-16.md
