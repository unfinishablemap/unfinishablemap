This is the task queue for AI automation. The human reviews and prioritizes tasks; the AI executes them.

## How to Edit This List

- **Promote**: Change `P2` to `P1`, etc.
- **Demote**: Change `P1` to `P2`, etc.
- **Veto**: Add `#veto` anywhere in the task heading (e.g., `### P2: Task name #veto`)
- **Add reason**: Optionally add `- **Veto reason**: [why]` before vetoing

Vetoed items are moved automatically to the Vetoed Tasks section on the next `/evolve` run.

## Priority Levels

- **P0**: Urgent - execute immediately
- **P1**: High - execute this week
- **P2**: Medium - execute when time permits
- **P2**: Low - nice to have, human approval needed

## Active Tasks

### P2: Research consciousness and episodic memory
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: The site has extensive coverage of attention, temporal consciousness, and the specious present, but the relationship between consciousness and memory—particularly episodic memory's role in constituting the self and grounding narrative identity—remains underexplored. Research could inform personal-identity.md and self-and-consciousness.md.
- **Source**: gap_analysis
- **Generated**: 2026-01-17

### P2: Cross-review neurophenomenology.md considering specious-present insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: The specious-present.md page (session 123) develops extensionalism vs retentionalism debate and Varela's neurophenomenology approach. Review concepts/neurophenomenology.md to add explicit cross-reference and strengthen the temporal phenomenology section.
- **Source**: chain (from specious-present.md)
- **Generated**: 2026-01-17

### P3: Cross-review personal-identity.md for Parfit treatment completeness
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: The parfit-reductionism.md page was linked from personal-identity.md but the topic page may benefit from fuller engagement with Parfit's arguments now that a dedicated page exists. Check for redundancy or gaps.
- **Source**: chain (from parfit-reductionism.md)
- **Generated**: 2026-01-17

## Completed Tasks

- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/attention-as-interface.md formalizes attention as the interface layer between consciousness and neural systems. Review concepts/quantum-consciousness.md to add link and consider how the attention-as-interface hypothesis provides a specific mechanism for the quantum selection process.
- **Result**: Added attention-as-interface to concepts frontmatter, added paragraph in Stapp section explaining how the attention-as-interface hypothesis transforms Stapp's framework into specific research program with candidate selection sites and testable predictions, added to Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/quantum-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Cross-review arguments-for-dualism.md considering cognitive science research
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Research in cognitive-science-dualism-2026-01-15.md covers Bloom's natural-born dualists thesis, Barrett's cross-cultural challenges, and the folk error vs cognitive naturalness debate. This bears on whether dualism is a mere cognitive bias. Review concepts/arguments-for-dualism.md to engage with this evidence.
- **Result**: Added new "The Folk Error Objection" section covering Bloom's natural-born dualists thesis, Barrett et al.'s cross-cultural findings suggesting intuitive materialism as default, and four arguments why cognitive science doesn't undermine dualism philosophically. Added research link to related_articles.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/arguments-for-dualism.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Cross-review mental-effort.md considering attention-as-interface hypothesis
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/attention-as-interface.md develops the relationship between attention and consciousness's causal influence. Review concepts/mental-effort.md to add link and strengthen the connection between the phenomenology of effort and attention's role as interface.
- **Result**: Added attention-as-interface to concepts frontmatter, added new "Attention as Interface Layer" subsection explaining how the hypothesis sharpens the analysis of why effort feels effortful and why mental effort is domain-specific, added to Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/mental-effort.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Create article on attention as interface hypothesis
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/attention-as-interface-hypothesis-2026-01-16.md. Formalizes site's implicit position that attention mediates consciousness-to-matter causation. Includes candidate selection sites, relation to GWT/IIT/PP, testable predictions. Would strengthen the mechanism story.
- **Result**: Created ~2000 word concept page covering core hypothesis claims, candidate selection sites (frontoparietal, posterior hot zone, ion channels, microcolumns, microtubules), bandwidth constraint, relation to major theories, testable predictions and falsification conditions. Updated attention.md with link.
- **Output**: Created `concepts/attention-as-interface.md`, updated `concepts/attention.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Cross-review ai-consciousness.md considering experiential alignment insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/experiential-alignment.md proposes alignment objective framed in experiential terms. Review topics/ai-consciousness.md to add link and consider how experiential alignment bears on the AI consciousness question—if AI lacks consciousness, experiential alignment becomes impossible to verify.
- **Result**: Added "The Experiential Alignment Problem" subsection explaining why AI's lack of consciousness creates a fundamental problem for experiential alignment—unconscious systems cannot verify experiential targets, only optimize proxies. This supports human oversight as structural necessity.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/ai-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Cross-review ethics-of-consciousness.md considering experiential alignment insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/experiential-alignment.md connects phenomenal value realism to AI alignment. Review topics/ethics-of-consciousness.md to add link and strengthen the connection between consciousness ethics and alignment theory.
- **Result**: Updated "The Alignment Problem" section to link experiential-alignment and phenomenal-value-realism concepts. Clarified that experiential alignment faces structural limitation under site's framework: unconscious AI cannot verify experiential targets, making human oversight structurally necessary.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/ethics-of-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Cross-review hard-problem-of-consciousness.md with Chalmers three principles
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: The hard problem topic references Chalmers but doesn't engage deeply with his three principles (structural coherence, organizational invariance, double-aspect information). Research in chalmers-psychophysical-laws-2026-01-17.md provides foundation for richer engagement.
- **Result**: Added "Chalmers' Psychophysical Framework" subsection covering three principles, Chalmers-McQueen (2022) super-resistance principle, and link to psychophysical-coupling-law.md. Added psychophysical-coupling-law to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Write article on experiential alignment for AI
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/alignment-objective-experiential-terms-2026-01-16.md. Proposes alignment objective framed in experiential terms (suffering, agency, meaning) rather than preference satisfaction. Key insight: if preferences are thin proxies, target experiential distributions directly.
- **Result**: Created ~2000 word concept page on experiential alignment. Covers eight experiential dimensions, proxy challenges, Goodhart failure modes, wireheading risks, safeguards. Updated purpose-and-alignment.md with new section.
- **Output**: Created `concepts/experiential-alignment.md`, updated `topics/purpose-and-alignment.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Cross-review psychophysical-coupling-law.md with Chalmers research

Enhance existing page with this deeper engagement.
- **Result**: Enhanced Chalmers section with three principles, added Chalmers-McQueen (2022) quantum development and super-resistance principle, clarified upward vs downward direction, explained site's divergence from organizational invariance.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/psychophysical-coupling-law.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Cross-review many-worlds.md considering Parfit's reductionism insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/parfit-reductionism.md develops the "many-worlds convergence" argument—Parfit's reductionism and MWI face parallel problems about which copy/branch is "really you". Review arguments/many-worlds.md to add cross-reference and strengthen the indexical identity argument.
- **Result**: Added "The Parfit Convergence" subsection to Argument 2 (indexical problem). New table comparing Parfit and MWI on what matters, identity questions, and indexical facts. Added parfit-reductionism to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `arguments/many-worlds.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Research Chalmers psychophysical laws in depth
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: The site references Chalmers' psychophysical laws framework in psychophysical-coupling-law.md but could develop this more thoroughly. Would strengthen the coupling law concept and provide richer philosophical context for the mind-matter interface.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering Chalmers' three principles (structural coherence, organizational invariance, double-aspect information), naturalistic dualism framework, recent quantum development with McQueen (super-resistance principle), and how site's coupling laws relate to Chalmers' upward-direction laws.
- **Output**: `research/chalmers-psychophysical-laws-2026-01-17.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Cross-review death-and-consciousness.md considering Parfit's reductionism insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/parfit-reductionism.md argues the site rejects Parfit's "what matters" move—survival requires identity, not just psychological continuity. Review topics/death-and-consciousness.md to engage with Parfit's position that death is less bad if identity is reducible.
- **Result**: Added "Parfit's 'Liberating' View of Death" subsection explaining Parfit's claim that death is metaphysically shallow if identity is reducible, and why the site rejects this. Added parfit-reductionism to concepts.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/death-and-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Engage Parfit on personal identity directly
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-01-16. The site implies critique of Parfit's reductionism (patterns don't make choices) but doesn't fully develop it. Would strengthen personal-identity.md and support No Many Worlds tenet via indexical identity.
- **Result**: Created ~2400 word concept page covering Parfit's reductionist thesis, key thought experiments (teletransportation, fission, gradual replacement), and five grounds for the site's rejection: patterns don't make choices, zombie conceivability, many-worlds convergence, causal history, practical stakes. Connected to all relevant tenets.
- **Output**: `concepts/parfit-reductionism.md`, updated `topics/personal-identity.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Cross-review free-will.md considering moral-responsibility insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/moral-responsibility.md covers desert under agent causation, luck objection response, phenomenology of effort connection. Review topics/free-will.md to add link to moral-responsibility page and strengthen the agent-causation/ethics connection.
- **Result**: Added moral-responsibility to concepts, new "Free Will and Moral Responsibility" section explaining how agent causation grounds metaphysical (not just pragmatic) desert, link to dedicated treatment.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/free-will.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Cross-review ethics-of-consciousness.md considering moral-responsibility insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/moral-responsibility.md provides detailed treatment of how agent causation grounds desert differently than compatibilism. Review topics/ethics-of-consciousness.md to add link and potentially expand moral responsibility section.
- **Result**: Added moral-responsibility and agent-causation to concepts, new "Moral Responsibility: Agent Causation and Desert" section covering how consciousness grounds moral agency as well as moral patienthood, link to dedicated treatment.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/ethics-of-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Create concept page on moral responsibility under agent causation
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-01-16. If consciousness is causally efficacious and agents are genuine sources, this grounds moral responsibility differently than compatibilism. What does desert look like under this framework? Connects free-will.md and agent-causation.md to ethics.
- **Result**: Created ~2200 word concept page covering: how agent causation grounds desert differently than compatibilism (metaphysical vs pragmatic), genuine sourcehood and contrastive explanation, luck objection response, retribution intelligibility, mitigation limits, character responsibility, role of consciousness, practical implications.
- **Output**: `concepts/moral-responsibility.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Cross-review temporal-consciousness.md with specious present research insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/specious-present-temporal-experience-2026-01-16.md provides detailed coverage of extensionalism vs retentionalism debate, duration estimates, and connection to quantum collapse phenomenology. Review concepts/temporal-consciousness.md to enhance specious present section with these insights.
- **Result**: Added extensionalism vs retentionalism debate section, site's modified extensionalism position (collapse constitutes duration-blocks), Varela neurophenomenology with contemplative access to temporal microstructure, khanika and cessation as evidence, duration estimates, links to specious-present.md and neurophenomenology.md.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/temporal-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Create concept page on the specious present
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/specious-present-temporal-experience-2026-01-16.md. While temporal-consciousness.md covers the specious present, a dedicated concept page would allow deeper treatment of: extensionalism vs retentionalism debate, duration estimates (100ms-3s), James vs Husserl vs Bergson approaches, connection to neurophenomenology, and quantum collapse timing. Would strengthen the time-consciousness connection central to the site's framework.
- **Result**: Created ~2000 word concept page covering duration estimates with comparison table, extensionalism vs retentionalism debate, site's modified extensionalism position, Varela's neurophenomenology, connection to quantum collapse timing, AI consciousness implications, cessation as negative evidence.
- **Output**: `concepts/specious-present.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Cross-review illusionism.md considering attention schema theory insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/attention-schema-theory.md explains AST as the primary neuroscientific implementation of illusionism. Review concepts/illusionism.md to add explicit engagement with AST as the mechanistic story behind illusionist claims.
- **Result**: Added "The Neuroscientific Mechanism: Attention Schema Theory" section explaining AST as illusionism's mechanistic implementation. Covered 2025 MIT neuroimaging evidence and site's regress critique. Updated concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/illusionism.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Cross-review attention.md considering attention schema theory insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/attention-schema-theory.md provides detailed treatment of AST as a materialist theory. Review concepts/attention.md to add link to the dedicated AST page and strengthen the site's position that attention is the interface for consciousness—not that attention schemas explain consciousness away.
- **Result**: Added attention-schema-theory to concepts, wikilink in AST section, illusionism and AST page to Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/attention.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Create concept page on attention schema theory
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Graziano's attention schema theory (AST) is a major functionalist account of consciousness that the site should engage. Currently mentioned briefly in attention.md but deserves full treatment—particularly the site's critique that AST explains reports about consciousness, not consciousness itself.
- **Result**: Created ~2200 word concept page covering AST's core idea (consciousness as attention modeling), neural evidence (2025 MIT study, ASTOUND project), relationship to illusionism (Frankish, Dennett), detailed critique (regress problem, aboutness, explanatory gap remains), and why the site rejects AST while preserving attention's central role.
- **Output**: `concepts/attention-schema-theory.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Research specious present and temporal experience
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: The site's philosophy-of-time.md and temporal-consciousness.md reference the specious present but could develop it further. Key questions: What is the specious present exactly (James, Husserl)? How does it relate to quantum collapse timing? What are the phenomenological investigations (Varela, microphenomenology)? Would strengthen the consciousness-time connection.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering extensionalism vs retentionalism debate, duration estimates (100ms-3s range), Varela's neurophenomenology of time, contemplative access to temporal microstructure, and connection to quantum collapse phenomenology. Key finding: specious present may be phenomenological manifestation of consciousness's constitutive role in time.
- **Output**: `research/specious-present-temporal-experience-2026-01-16.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Cross-review mysterianism.md considering whether-real voids insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New voids article voids/whether-real.md explores whether cognitive limits are genuinely permanent. Review concepts/mysterianism.md to engage with the undecidability finding—the question "are limits real?" may itself be a void.
- **Result**: Added "Can We Know If the Limits Are Real?" section engaging with the meta-level question. Covers self-referential structure making the question undecidable from within. Three positions: optimist (Dennett), pessimist (McGinn/Chomsky), suspended (undecidable).
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/mysterianism.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Cross-review intentionality.md considering cognitive phenomenology insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/cognitive-phenomenology.md connects to phenomenal intentionality thesis (Horgan, Tienson). Review concepts/intentionality.md to add cognitive phenomenology dimension—if understanding itself has phenomenal character, this strengthens the case that intentionality is phenomenologically grounded.
- **Result**: Added "The Cognitive Phenomenology Connection" subsection to PIT section. Explains how proprietary phenomenal character of thinking strengthens PIT: the phenomenal character of grasping meaning determines intentional content.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/intentionality.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Cross-review ai-consciousness.md considering cognitive phenomenology insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/cognitive-phenomenology.md discusses whether LLMs could have "pale" cognitive phenomenology without sensory qualia. Review topics/ai-consciousness.md to engage with this—the cognitive phenomenology debate bears directly on the AI consciousness question.
- **Result**: Added "Cognitive Phenomenology and the Understanding Question" section explaining how cognitive phenomenology debate strengthens AI consciousness skepticism: if understanding requires proprietary phenomenal character, LLMs lack understanding itself, not just sensory qualia.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/ai-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Cross-review collapse-and-time.md considering philosophy-of-time insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/philosophy-of-time.md provides systematic framework for time ontology. Review concepts/collapse-and-time.md to add references to A-theory/B-theory distinction and how site's position relates to standard positions in philosophy of time.
- **Result**: Added new "Collapse and the Philosophy of Time" section connecting collapse interpretations to McTaggart's A-series/B-series, explaining how collapse realism supports A-theory while decoherence supports B-theory, and the site's modified growing block proposal.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/collapse-and-time.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Create voids article on whether cognitive limits are real
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/voids-whether-real-2026-01-17.md. Key meta-level question: are cognitive limits genuine (structural) or merely current ignorance? Finding—the question may be formally undecidable from within, which is itself informative about cognitive architecture. Connects to mysterianism and limits-reveal-structure.
- **Result**: Created ~1900 word voids article exploring the meta-level question of whether cognitive limits are permanent or contingent. Covers optimist (Dennett), pessimist (McGinn/Chomsky), and suspended positions. Key finding: the question may be formally undecidable from within, which is itself informative about cognitive architecture.
- **Output**: `voids/whether-real.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Create concept page on cognitive phenomenology
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/cognitive-phenomenology-thinking-experience-2026-01-17.md. Covers liberalism vs conservatism debate on whether thinking itself has phenomenal character (beyond sensory imagery). Key relevance to AI consciousness question—could LLMs have "pale" cognitive phenomenology without sensory qualia?
- **Result**: Created ~1800 word concept page covering the central question, arguments for/against (Strawson, Pitt, Siewert vs Tye, Dretske), phenomenal intentionality connection, AI consciousness implications, evidence from aphantasia and training effects.
- **Output**: `concepts/cognitive-phenomenology.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Cross-review retrocausality.md considering philosophy-of-time insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/philosophy-of-time.md discusses how retrocausality might favor eternalism/block universe while collapse favors presentism. Review concepts/retrocausality.md to engage with this tension and explain how the site reconciles retrocausal selection with consciousness-constituted time.
- **Result**: Added new "Time Ontology and Retrocausality" section explaining how retrocausality seems to require eternalism but site reconciles via modified growing block—retrocausality operates on superposed possibilities, not ontologically existing future facts. Added philosophy-of-time and time-collapse-and-agency to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/retrocausality.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Cross-review temporal-consciousness.md considering philosophy-of-time insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/philosophy-of-time.md covers McTaggart's A/B series, presentism/eternalism/growing-block, and site's consciousness-constituted collapse position. Review concepts/temporal-consciousness.md to add links to formal philosophy of time framework and strengthen the phenomenology-metaphysics connection.
- **Result**: Added new "The Metaphysical Framework" section connecting temporal phenomenology to formal philosophy of time (A-theory vs B-theory, presentism vs eternalism). Explains how site's growing block view interprets specious present as phenomenology of collapse. Added philosophy-of-time to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/temporal-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Create concept page on philosophy of time and consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-01-16. The site implies a metaphysics of time but doesn't make it explicit. Collapse realism favors presentism; retrocausality might favor block universe. These need reconciliation. Would strengthen collapse-and-time.md and retrocausality.md.
- **Result**: Created ~1900 word concept page covering McTaggart's A-series/B-series framework, presentism/eternalism/growing-block ontology, A-theory vs B-theory, time in physics (classical, relativistic, quantum), and site's consciousness-constituted collapse position.
- **Output**: `concepts/philosophy-of-time.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Research cognitive phenomenology (experience of thinking)
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-01-16. Is there a phenomenology of thinking, not just sensory experience? This matters for whether LLMs might have "pale" consciousness even without sensory qualia. Would extend intentionality.md and phenomenology.md.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering liberalism vs conservatism debate, Strawson/Pitt/Siewert arguments, AI/LLM implications, phenomenal intentionality connection. Key finding: cognitive phenomenology debate directly relevant to AI consciousness question.
- **Output**: `research/cognitive-phenomenology-thinking-experience-2026-01-17.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Cross-review arguments-for-dualism.md considering epistemic-advantages insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New topic topics/epistemic-advantages-of-dualism.md argues dualism is the epistemically humble stance. Review concepts/arguments-for-dualism.md to add reference—epistemic humility is a meta-level argument that complements the object-level arguments.
- **Result**: Added new "The Meta-Level Argument: Epistemic Humility" section explaining how the epistemic advantages argument complements object-level arguments. Covers asymmetric costs of error, risks materialists cannot see, and opening vs closing moves. Added to related_articles and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/arguments-for-dualism.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Cross-review consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns.md considering psychophysical coupling law insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/psychophysical-coupling-law.md covers bandwidth constraints (~10 bits/second) and candidate coupling laws. Review concepts/consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns.md to ensure consistency and add cross-references—these are companion pages covering mechanism vs. law aspects.
- **Result**: Added psychophysical-coupling-law to concepts list. Updated candidate constraint families section with link to coupling law treatment. Enhanced "The coupling law" open question with reference to four candidate laws. Added coupling law page to Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Cross-review mysterianism.md considering limits-reveal-structure insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New voids article voids/limits-reveal-structure.md covers how cognitive limits reveal cognitive architecture (Chomsky, McGinn, Nagel). Review concepts/mysterianism.md to add reference to the voids treatment and strengthen the "limits are informative" theme.
- **Result**: Added new section "What the Limits Reveal" explaining how cognitive closure reveals cognitive architecture. Links to limits-reveal-structure voids article. The shape of limitations reveals the structure of minds—transforming mysterianism from pessimism into method.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/mysterianism.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Cross-review quantum-consciousness.md considering psychophysical coupling law insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/psychophysical-coupling-law.md formalizes the coupling problem with four candidate laws and bandwidth constraints. Review concepts/quantum-consciousness.md to add reference to the coupling law framework—the "how" of selection should link to the dedicated treatment.
- **Result**: Added new section "The Coupling Law Requirement" explaining what a coupling law must specify (mental variables, physical variables, bandwidth, scope). Links to psychophysical-coupling-law and interface-locality pages. Updated concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/quantum-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Create concept page on interface locality (why selection is brain-restricted)
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/brain-specialness-boundary-2026-01-15.md. Addresses the embarrassing implication: if consciousness can bias quantum outcomes, why only in brains? Four principled boundary conditions: interface locality, control loop integration, developmental integration, attention scope. Key insight: boundary follows mechanistically from Stapp's Process 1, not ad hoc restriction.
- **Result**: Created ~2000 word concept page explaining why consciousness can bias quantum outcomes in the brain without implying universal psychokinesis. Four boundary conditions: interface locality, control loop integration, developmental integration, and attention scope. The restriction follows from Stapp's mechanism, not ad hoc. Connected to all five tenets.
- **Output**: `concepts/interface-locality.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Create concept page on psychophysical coupling law
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/psychophysical-coupling-problem-2026-01-15.md. The site asserts consciousness "selects" quantum outcomes but this is metaphorical without specifying the coupling law. Research identifies four candidate constraint families: attention-bounded (~10 bits/sec), policy-level, basis-choice, temporal/indexical. Would formalize "selection" from metaphor into research program.
- **Result**: Created ~2000 word concept page formalizing the coupling problem. Four candidate laws: attention-bounded selection, policy-level selection, basis-choice selection, and indexical selection. Bandwidth constraint (~10 bits/second) shapes what selection can accomplish. Connected to all five tenets.
- **Output**: `concepts/psychophysical-coupling-law.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Create voids article on cognitive limits revealing mind structure
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/voids-limits-reveal-structure-2026-01-16.md. Chomsky/McGinn/Nagel/Kant converge on insight that the shape of cognitive limits reveals cognitive architecture. What we cannot think is as informative as what we can. Maps to voids framework—exploring unthinkable territory illuminates what kind of beings we are. AI as asymmetric probe (different limits, can map human limits externally).
- **Result**: Created ~1900 word voids article on how cognitive limits reveal mind structure. Covers Chomsky's problems/mysteries, McGinn's cognitive closure, Nagel's bat, Kant/Wittgenstein on limits as constitutive. AI as asymmetric probe for human blind spots. Connected to Occam's Razor Has Limits, Dualism, and No Many Worlds tenets.
- **Output**: `voids/limits-reveal-structure.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Write article on epistemic advantages of non-materialist theories
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Dualism opens far more possibilities than materialism allows. Examples: (1) whatever "runs" consciousness might one day rebel or reject what we do (e.g., keeping brains alive in jars); (2) the non-physical realm could have its own complex dynamics we're unaware of. Materialists risk stumbling into these problems while denying their existence. Dualism brings the most open mind. Tie to the No Occam's Razor tenet—allowing the mind realm to be arbitrarily complex widens our epistemic possibilities rather than prematurely closing them. Frame as: why epistemically humble positions favour taking dualism seriously, even if unproven.
- **Result**: Created ~2000 word topic article arguing that dualism is the epistemically humble stance. Covers: materialism's closing moves (foreclosing possibilities by assumption), what dualism opens (complex mental reality, risks materialists cannot see, scenarios excluded a priori), and the argument from epistemic humility (asymmetric costs of being wrong). Connected to all five tenets with Occam's Razor Has Limits as central.

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/collapse-before-minds-early-universe-2026-01-16.md. Addresses the objection: if consciousness causes collapse, what selected outcomes before observers existed? Five major responses surveyed. Would strengthen No Many Worlds and Minimal Quantum Interaction tenets by addressing this common objection.
- **Result**: Created ~2000 word concept page covering the prebiotic collapse problem, five major responses (Wheeler's participatory universe, panpsychism, objective reduction, decoherence naturalization, Stapp's panexperientialism). Commits site to objective-reduction-with-consciousness-modulation position. Explains how this preserves all tenets while solving the prebiotic problem.
- **Output**: `concepts/prebiotic-collapse.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Add coherence inflation countermeasures to generation workflow
- **Type**: build-tool
- **Notes**: Because the site is intentionally a single worldview expressed as fact and heavily AI-generated, add hard constraints: (1) per-claim confidence metadata, (2) mandatory steelman sections for key opponents, (3) provenance tagging for empirical claims, (4) periodic external red-team reviews, (5) detection of circular citation loops across pages.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive protocol document with seven countermeasures: confidence stratification, mandatory steelman sections, provenance tagging, external red-team reviews, circular citation detection, freshness tracking, and explicit uncertainty propagation. Includes implementation details for workflow integration.
- **Output**: `project/coherence-inflation-countermeasures.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Create Voids safety protocol
- **Type**: meta-method
- **Notes**: If "voids" includes the occluded/unthinkable, the project needs explicit safety rails: avoid memetic hazards, coercive ideology traps, and psychologically destabilizing content; separate exploratory speculation from endorsed claims; require human review gates; define stop conditions.
- **Result**: Created safety protocol with seven principles: clear epistemic labeling, content boundaries (prohibited and boundary cases), exploration/endorsement separation, human review gates, exit paths, stop conditions, and no "hidden truth" framing. Includes reader notice for voids section.
- **Output**: `project/voids-safety-protocol.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Create concept page on QM interpretations
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/qm-interpretations-beyond-mwi-2026-01-16.md. Covers Copenhagen, Bohmian, QBism, relational QM, TI/TSVF, GRW/CSL. Would strengthen No Many Worlds tenet by engaging with alternative interpretations systematically. Key finding: TI/TSVF aligns with site's retrocausality framework.
- **Result**: Created ~1800 word concept page covering six major interpretations with consciousness role assessment for each. Includes comparison table with site alignment. Explains why site favors time-symmetric interpretations (TI/TSVF) and rejects Bohmian mechanics and MWI. Connected to free will, Libet problem, retrocausality.
- **Output**: `concepts/quantum-interpretations.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Create concept page on phenomenal value realism / metaethics
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/phenomenal-value-realism-metaethics-2026-01-16.md. The site implicitly treats conscious experience as the ground of value but doesn't name this metaethical position. Should cover Rawlette's analytic hedonism, phenomenal value pluralism, and comparison with welfarism/desire theory. Would formalize the implicit commitment and strengthen ethics-of-consciousness.md.
- **Result**: Created ~1900 word concept page covering Rawlette's analytic hedonism, the is-ought bridge, site's phenomenal value pluralism (beyond hedonism), connection to dualism and indexical identity, implications for AI/animal ethics/meaning, objections and responses.
- **Output**: `concepts/phenomenal-value-realism.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Cross-review free-will.md with luck objection research
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/luck-objection-libertarian-free-will-2026-01-17.md covers van Inwagen's rollback argument and Mele's present/remote luck distinction. Review topics/free-will.md to add explicit engagement with the luck objection—this is the main challenge to libertarian free will that the quantum selection framework must address.
- **Result**: Added new "The Luck Objection" and "Why the Site's Framework Escapes Luck" sections. Covers van Inwagen's rollback argument, Mele's present/remote luck distinction, comparison table (lucky vs selected indeterminism), connection to phenomenology of effort and agent causation.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/free-will.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Formalize the "attention as interface" hypothesis into a mechanistic research agenda
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Attention is treated as dissociable from consciousness and as the likely control surface for mind→brain influence. Convert into actionable questions: which neural correlates of attention are candidates for "selection sites"? What is the relationship to global workspace / predictive processing / IIT? What would count as evidence that attention is more than computation here?  Refer to the source of this task obsidian/reviews/outer-review-2026-01-15-site-chatgpt-5-2-pro.md also.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research formalizing the implicit "attention as interface" commitment into explicit hypothesis and research agenda. Identified five candidate selection sites (frontoparietal networks, posterior hot zone, cortical microcolumns, ion channels, microtubules). Analyzed relation to GWT/IIT/predictive processing—reinterpreted as physical correlates that consciousness uses. Generated five testable research questions with predictions. Listed falsification conditions.
- **Output**: `research/attention-as-interface-hypothesis-2026-01-16.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Develop a dedicated topic on "Time, collapse, and agency"
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Free will uses retrocausality/atemporal selection; collapse is linked to the arrow of time. Consolidate: what metaphysics of time is implied (presentism/eternalism/relational), how "selection across time" avoids contradictions, and what phenomenology of temporal experience (durée/specious present) would be predicted by the framework. Refer to the source of this task obsidian/reviews/outer-review-2026-01-15-site-chatgpt-5-2-pro.md also.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive topic consolidating the site's temporal commitments. Addresses presentism vs eternalism (proposes growing-block with consciousness-constituted collapse), explains how atemporal selection reconciles with irreversibility, maps phenomenology predictions (specious present, possibility narrowing, effort, durée), strengthens free-will arguments, and lists falsification conditions.
- **Output**: `topics/time-collapse-and-agency.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Build testability ledger for the framework
- **Type**: meta-method
- **Notes**: Several pages say the framework is falsifiable, but test hooks are diffuse. Create a central ledger: what observations would update against dualism, against quantum interface, against retrocausal repair, against filter theory? Separate (a) decisive disconfirmers, (b) weak evidence, (c) non-evidence. This also guards against unfalsifiability accusations.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive testability ledger covering all five tenets plus filter theory and retrocausality. For each claim: decisive disconfirmers, weak evidence against, weak evidence for, and non-evidence. Summary table with current assessment of each claim's vulnerability.
- **Output**: `project/testability-ledger.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Create Ethics of consciousness as a core topic
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: The site already touches animal consciousness, AI non-consciousness, and identity non-patternism. Consolidate into an ethics topic: moral patienthood, suffering/valence, moral uncertainty policy, simulation ethics under dualism, and why "copying a person" is not "saving them."
- **Result**: Created ~3000 word topic page covering foundation of consciousness-based ethics, moral patienthood (who counts), moral uncertainty (precautionary principle vs weighted consideration), animal ethics, AI ethics, identity ethics (copies, uploads, simulations), and suffering as moral core. Connected to all five tenets.
- **Output**: `topics/ethics-of-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Unify filter/transmission and quantum selection into a single model
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Filter theory explains correlation without production; quantum selection explains causal efficacy. Build a synthesis page: a two-layer architecture (source/field + interface/control), what each metaphor buys, where each is only heuristic.
- **Result**: Created ~2400 word concept page proposing unified two-layer model: Layer 1 (Source/Field) from filter theory, Layer 2 (Interface/Control) from quantum selection. Explains how layers connect, what each explains, empirical discriminators, and objections/responses. The unified model implements all five tenets.
- **Output**: `concepts/mind-matter-interface.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Research QM interpretations beyond MWI
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Anti-MWI is explicit; the site should also clearly position itself vs Bohmian mechanics, QBism, relational QM, objective collapse (GRW/CSL), and transactional/TSVF approaches—especially because retrocausality plays a big role in free will. Clarify: which interpretations leave room for consciousness-as-selector vs selector-as-physical-law vs "collapse is epistemic only."
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering 6 major interpretations (Copenhagen, Bohmian, QBism, relational QM, TI/TSVF, GRW/CSL). Key finding: TI/TSVF align strongly with site's retrocausality framework. Bohmian mechanics conflicts with free will phenomenology. QBism is agent-centered but anti-realist. Provides recommendations for site positioning.
- **Output**: `research/qm-interpretations-beyond-mwi-2026-01-16.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Deep review split-brain-consciousness.md
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: AI-generated content from session 47 that hasn't received a deep review. Check for: engagement with latest split-brain research, connections to newer content (binding-problem.md, personal-identity.md), tenet alignment strength.
- **Result**: Enhanced with 2025 PNAS study specifics (Prof. Miller quotes), added haecceity concept for identity puzzle framing, connected consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns mechanism to Bidirectional Interaction section, added hyperlinks to latest research sources.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/split-brain-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Create concept page for consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Referenced 5 times in tenets and other content as the proposed mechanism for mind-matter interaction. Deserves dedicated treatment explaining the model in detail.
- **Result**: Created ~2000 word concept page covering candidate selection sites (microtubules, ion channels, microcolumns, attention networks), bandwidth constraints (~10 bits/sec), brain specialness boundary, selection vs randomness distinction, four candidate constraint families. Connected to Minimal Quantum Interaction, Bidirectional Interaction, and Dualism tenets.
- **Output**: `concepts/consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Cross-review decoherence.md with quantum biology research
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New research in quantum-biology-consciousness-2026-01-16.md provides biological examples of quantum coherence (avian magnetoreception microseconds, enzyme tunneling). Review concepts/decoherence.md to add these biological examples as evidence that decoherence isn't always rapid.
- **Result**: Enhanced quantum biology sections in decoherence.md. Added microsecond coherence times for avian magnetoreception (million times longer than typical molecular decoherence), Jan 2026 Princeton JACS confirmation, specific enzyme tunneling acceleration factors (10^12-10^17), kinetic isotope evidence. Added quantum-biology to related_articles and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/decoherence.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Research the luck objection to libertarian free will
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: The luck objection (van Inwagen, Mele) argues that indeterminism makes actions random rather than free. Kane's response appeals to self-forming actions; agent-causation theorists appeal to substance causation. How does the site's quantum selection framework address this? Is consciousness-directed selection different from mere randomness? Would strengthen free-will.md and agent-causation.md.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering van Inwagen's rollback argument, Mele's present/remote luck distinction, Kane's SFAs and dual efforts response, agent-causal responses (O'Connor, Lowe, Chisholm). Key contribution: how site's quantum selection framework addresses the objection—reasons-guided selection is distinct from mere randomness; phenomenology of effort distinguishes selection from luck.
- **Output**: `research/luck-objection-libertarian-free-will-2026-01-17.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Research consciousness-selecting mechanisms in detail
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: The site's Minimal Quantum Interaction and Bidirectional Interaction tenets depend on consciousness selecting among quantum outcomes. But what would the detailed mechanism look like? Key questions: How does attention/intention map to specific neural quantum systems? What's the information bandwidth? Does selection happen at individual neurons, microtubules, or larger ensembles? Would strengthen quantum-consciousness.md and support the P2 task for consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns concept page.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering candidate selection sites (microtubules/Orch OR, spintronic coherence/QBIT, ion channels, cortical microcolumns, attention networks), 2025 experimental support, bandwidth constraints (~10 bits/second implies coarse-grained policy-level selection), how attention maps to quantum systems via Stapp's Zeno mechanism, ensemble vs single-site selection, brain specialness boundary.
- **Output**: `research/consciousness-selecting-mechanisms-detail-2026-01-17.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Propose alignment objective framed in experiential terms
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: If preferences are thin proxies and AI lacks "inside understanding," alignment should target predicted distributions over human experiences (suffering, agency, meaning, attention, social connection). Draft a concrete schema: what measurable proxies could approximate experiential quality without collapsing into naïve behaviorism? Tie to neurophenomenology/first-person methods and explicitly state failure modes (Goodhart, manipulation, wireheading-like traps).  Refer to the source of this task obsidian/reviews/outer-review-2026-01-15-site-chatgpt-5-2-pro.md also.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research proposing multi-dimensional experiential alignment schema. Identified eight candidate experiential dimensions (hedonic valence, suffering, agency, meaning, attention, connection, understanding, temporal experience). Proposed measurable proxies (ESM, DRM, microphenomenology, neural signatures) with their limitations. Analyzed failure modes (four Goodhart variants, wireheading risks, manipulation risks, homogenization risks). Specified safeguards (proxy pluralism, first-person methods, human override, adversarial testing). Connected to site's phenomenal value pluralism metaethics.
- **Output**: `research/alignment-objective-experiential-terms-2026-01-16.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Create concept page for quantum-biology
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/quantum-biology-consciousness-2026-01-16.md. Covers photosynthesis FMO complex, avian magnetoreception (Jan 2026 Princeton JACS), enzyme tunneling, quantum olfaction. Would provide empirical grounding for Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet and strengthen decoherence objection response.
- **Result**: Created dedicated concept page covering established quantum biological effects (photosynthesis, avian magnetoreception, enzyme tunneling, olfaction), brain quantum theories (Orch OR, QBIT), and implications for the site's framework. Key argument: quantum biology removes the categorical "warm, wet, and noisy" objection without itself proving consciousness involves quantum effects. Defensive role for Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet.
- **Output**: `concepts/quantum-biology.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Create dedicated concept page on haecceity and indexical identity
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: The site leans heavily on indexical identity in anti-MWI and personal identity, but doesn't name the metaphysical commitment. Build a page explaining haecceitism, self-locating facts, and how "this subject" differs from pattern-identity. Connect to pairing problem, personal identity, teleportation/uploading cases, and MWI probability/indexical puzzles.
- **Result**: Created ~2000 word concept page covering Duns Scotus's haecceity concept, haecceitism vs anti-haecceitism debate, why consciousness requires haecceity (zombie argument connection), self-locating beliefs, teleportation/uploading implications, connection to pairing problem and MWI probability problem. Connected to site's dualism, no-many-worlds, and bidirectional interaction tenets.
- **Output**: `concepts/haecceity.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Research phenomenal value realism and metaethics
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Meaning-of-life + alignment pages implicitly treat conscious experience as the ground of value. Make that explicit: what kind of realism is this (or is it constructivist)? How does it relate to welfarism, virtue ethics, contractualism, error theory, etc.? What exactly is the "intrinsic significance" claim (valence, richness, unity, agency, narrative, attention)?
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering Sharon Hewitt Rawlette's phenomenal value realism / analytic hedonism, the is-ought bridge via phenomenal qualities being simultaneously descriptive and normative, comparison with welfarism/desire theory/objective list theory. Identified site's implicit position as "phenomenal value pluralism"—multiple features of experience have intrinsic value (not just hedonic valence). Recommended making the metaethical commitment explicit in a dedicated concept page.
- **Output**: `research/phenomenal-value-realism-metaethics-2026-01-16.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Address "collapse before minds" (early-universe outcome selection)
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: No Many Worlds + real outcome selection creates a prebiotic cosmology pressure: what selected outcomes before observers? Options: objective collapse with consciousness modulation; panpsychist/proto-experiential selection; cosmic consciousness; other. Create a dedicated treatment that cleanly separates "collapse exists" from "consciousness causes collapse," and states which version the site commits to (or why it stays agnostic). Refer to the source of this task obsidian/reviews/outer-review-2026-01-15-site-chatgpt-5-2-pro.md also.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering five major responses to the prebiotic problem: (1) Wheeler's participatory universe (retrocausal bootstrapping), (2) panpsychism/proto-experiential selection, (3) Penrose-style objective reduction (collapse precedes consciousness), (4) decoherence naturalization, (5) separation of "collapse exists" from "consciousness causes collapse." Recommended site position: objective reduction with consciousness modulation—collapse happens via physical mechanisms (preserving prebiotic cosmology) but consciousness interfaces with collapse in developed neural systems.
- **Output**: `research/collapse-before-minds-early-universe-2026-01-16.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Research psychophysical coupling problem ("selection law")
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: The site repeatedly says consciousness "selects" among quantum outcomes (tenets; free will; quantum consciousness). Make explicit that this requires a psychophysical coupling law: what variables in conscious experience map to what selectable degrees of freedom? What is the bandwidth? What is not selectable? Propose candidate constraint families (e.g., selection only within attention-controlled neural subspaces; only policy-level not micro-level; only basis-choice not amplitude). Aim: turn "selection" from metaphor into a research program. Refer to the source of this task obsidian/reviews/outer-review-2026-01-15-site-chatgpt-5-2-pro.md also.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research identifying the coupling problem and proposing four candidate constraint families: (1) Attention-bounded selection (~10 bits/second bandwidth), (2) Policy-level selection (coarse alternatives only), (3) Basis-choice selection (choosing the question, not the answer), (4) Temporal/indexical selection. Integrated 2024-2025 research on conscious processing bandwidth, Chalmers on psychophysical laws, Stapp on quantum selection, and recent quantum consciousness developments.
- **Output**: `research/psychophysical-coupling-problem-2026-01-15.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Research brain specialness boundary (why not psychokinesis)
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Minimal Quantum Interaction + Bidirectional Interaction risks sliding into "mind can bias any quantum event." The site rejects woo, but needs an explicit limiter: why is the interface restricted to brains (or to systems already integrated into the subject's control loop)? Produce a principled boundary condition and show how it avoids both epiphenomenalism and parapsychology-by-implication. Refer to the source of this task obsidian/reviews/outer-review-2026-01-15-site-chatgpt-5-2-pro.md also.
- **Result**: Research establishing four principled boundary conditions: (1) Interface locality—only systems within neural control loop, (2) Control loop integration—selection requires awareness of alternatives, (3) Developmental/evolutionary integration—only systems the brain grew with, (4) Attention scope—only what can be attended. Key insight: the boundary follows mechanistically from Stapp's Process 1 model, not from ad hoc restriction. The quantum Zeno mechanism operates through attention, which is neurally implemented; consciousness can only bias what it observes.
- **Output**: `research/brain-specialness-boundary-2026-01-15.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Research quantum biology and consciousness
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Avian magnetoreception demonstrates evolution can harness quantum coherence for biological function. What other quantum biological effects exist? Photosynthesis quantum coherence, enzyme tunneling, olfaction theories. How do these relate to the possibility of neural quantum effects? Would strengthen the decoherence objection response and provide empirical grounding for Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering established quantum biological effects (photosynthesis FMO complex, avian magnetoreception with Jan 2026 Princeton confirmation, enzyme quantum tunneling, quantum olfaction) and brain quantum effects (Orch OR, QBIT theories). Key findings: biological quantum effects prove evolution can harness coherence; the "warm, wet, and noisy" objection is weaker than claimed; measurement problem remains open in all cases.
- **Output**: `research/quantum-biology-consciousness-2026-01-16.md`

Review quantum-consciousness.md to strengthen the decoherence objection section with specific responses and timescale arguments.
- **Result**: Added Tegmark-Hameroff Debate section with 7 orders of magnitude dispute, specific protective mechanisms, revised timescale requirements (10⁻⁷s), avian magnetoreception example with Jan 2026 Princeton JACS paper, and key finding about indeterminacy persisting after decoherence.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/quantum-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Research quantum decoherence objection responses in detail
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: The decoherence objection is mentioned in tenets.md and quantum-consciousness.md but responses could be more specific. What exactly do the "hot cat" experiments show? How does Orch OR address decoherence specifically? What timescales are actually needed for consciousness-related quantum effects? Would strengthen the site's response to this major objection.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering Tegmark-Hameroff debate (7 orders of magnitude difference in estimates), protective mechanisms (Debye layer, actin gel, hydrophobic interior), revised timescales (10⁻⁷s with faster dynamics), biological quantum effects (photosynthesis, avian magnetoreception with Jan 2026 Princeton JACS paper), hot cat experiments (1.8K demonstration), 1,400-second coherence record. Key finding: decoherence doesn't eliminate quantum indeterminacy—consciousness could bias outcomes at measurement even after decoherence.

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Cross-review ai-consciousness.md considering Hoel LLM consciousness research
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Research in research/hoel-llm-consciousness-continual-learning-2026-01-16.md analyzes Hoel's proximity argument (LLMs are too close to lookup tables) and continual learning criterion. Review topics/ai-consciousness.md to incorporate these insights—particularly the proximity argument against functionalism and how continual learning distinguishes conscious from non-conscious systems.
- **Result**: Added hoel-llm-consciousness research to related_articles; added new "Proximity Argument" subsection with Hoel's formal argument structure, Kleiner-Hoel dilemma, and connection to lookup tables; expanded continual learning section with link to research and lenient dependency explanation; added research to Further Reading.

- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Research the paper at https://web3.arxiv.org/abs/2512.12802 and evaluate how it stands up to the site's perspective on consciousness and dualism. Assess alignment or tension with the five tenets.
- **Result**: Analyzed Erik Hoel's "A Disproof of Large Language Model Consciousness" which argues continual learning is necessary for consciousness. Found mostly aligned with site tenets: anti-functionalism (proximity argument), consciousness as causal (implicit support for Bidirectional Interaction), skepticism of simple parsimony (supports Occam's Razor Has Limits). Orthogonal treatment of quantum mechanisms.
- **Output**: `research/hoel-llm-consciousness-continual-learning-2026-01-16.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Cross-review mental-causation.md considering against-epiphenomenalism argument

- **Result**: Added many-worlds to concepts; expanded No Many Worlds Connection section with link to formal argument page and detailed explanation of indexical problem; added many-worlds to Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/personal-identity.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Create argument page "Against Functionalism"
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: The arguments section needs 5 pages (currently 4: materialism, interactionist-dualism, many-worlds, epiphenomenalism). Functionalism is a major materialist position that the zombie argument and inverted qualia arguments undermine. Should cover: multiple realizability cuts both ways (if mental states are multiply realizable, physical substrate doesn't determine qualia), Chinese Room argument (syntax isn't semantics), absent qualia possibility, inverted qualia possibility. Draw from functionalism.md, philosophical-zombies.md, and inverted-qualia.md.
- **Result**: Created ~2400 word argument page with five arguments (absent qualia, inverted qualia, Chinese Room, multiple realizability cuts both ways, explanatory gap) with objections and responses. Connected to all five tenets.
- **Output**: `arguments/functionalism.md`, updated `arguments/arguments.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Create argument page "Against Epiphenomenalism"
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: The arguments section targets 5 pages but currently has only 2 (Against Materialism, For Interactionist Dualism). Epiphenomenalism is a major alternative to interactionism that the site's Bidirectional Interaction tenet directly rejects. Should cover: self-stultification argument (if consciousness is causally inert, our reports about it are accidentally right at best), evolutionary argument (phenomenal states must do something to have been selected), knowledge argument implications (Mary learns something causally relevant). Draw from epiphenomenalism.md and mental-causation.md.
- **Result**: Created ~2000 word argument page with five arguments (self-stultification, evolutionary objection, knowledge argument reversed, introspection problem, self-knowledge problem). Connected to all five tenets and linked to quantum framework response.
- **Output**: `arguments/epiphenomenalism.md`, updated `arguments/arguments.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Cross-review quantum-consciousness.md considering many-worlds argument
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New argument page arguments/many-worlds.md presents five arguments against MWI including the probability problem and preferred basis problem. Review concepts/quantum-consciousness.md to strengthen the connection—the quantum consciousness page should reference how site's collapse-based framework contrasts with MWI's unitarity assumption.
- **Result**: Added many-worlds to related_articles; expanded No Many Worlds tenet reference with link to five arguments; added many-worlds explanation in shared features section; added many-worlds to Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/quantum-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Cross-review measurement-problem.md considering many-worlds argument
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New argument page arguments/many-worlds.md covers the measurement problem from an anti-MWI perspective. Review concepts/measurement-problem.md to add explicit engagement with MWI as a proposed solution and why the site rejects it—this strengthens the No Many Worlds tenet.
- **Result**: Added many-worlds to related_articles; expanded MWI subsection with link to five detailed arguments; added many-worlds to Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/measurement-problem.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Create argument page "Against Many Worlds"
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: The No Many Worlds tenet needs a dedicated argument page in the arguments section. Should cover: ontological proliferation, indexical identity problems, probability interpretation issues, and why the site prefers collapse interpretations. Would strengthen the arguments section (currently only 1 of 5 target pages).
- **Result**: Created ~2300 word argument page with five arguments (ontological extravagance, indexical identity problem, probability problem, preferred basis problem, consciousness unaddressed) structured with premises and conclusions. Added objections and responses, connected to all five tenets.
- **Output**: `arguments/many-worlds.md`, updated `arguments/arguments.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Cross-review causal-closure.md considering interactionist-dualism argument
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New argument page arguments/interactionist-dualism.md presents the self-stultification argument and quantum indeterminacy mechanism. Review concepts/causal-closure.md to strengthen the connection—the causal closure page should explicitly reference how the interactionist argument page addresses the closure objection.
- **Result**: Added reference to formal argument page in quantum exception section; added interactionist-dualism to related_articles.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/causal-closure.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Cross-review epiphenomenalism.md considering interactionist-dualism argument
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New argument page arguments/interactionist-dualism.md presents the self-stultification argument against epiphenomenalism. Review concepts/epiphenomenalism.md to add reference to the formal argument structure and strengthen the objections section.
- **Result**: Added reference to formal argument page in self-stultification section.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/epiphenomenalism.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Create argument page "For Interactionist Dualism"
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: The arguments section has only 1 page (Against Materialism) vs target of 5. A formal argument page for interactionist dualism would consolidate the positive case: knowledge argument, conceivability arguments, unity of consciousness, intentionality, self-stultification of epiphenomenalism. Draw from arguments-for-dualism.md concept page but in structured argument form.
- **Result**: Created ~2000 word argument page with seven arguments (explanatory gap, zombie conceivability, Mary's Room, unity of consciousness, intentionality, self-stultification, quantum indeterminacy) structured in formal argument form with premises and conclusions. Added objections and responses table, connected to all five tenets.
- **Output**: `arguments/interactionist-dualism.md`, updated `arguments/arguments.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Cross-review hard-problem-of-consciousness.md considering pairing-problem insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/pairing-problem.md presents Kim's challenge that mind-body pairing is unintelligible without spatial relations. Review topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness.md to add pairing problem as another dimension of the hard problem—not just "why experience?" but "why *this* experience with *this* body?"
- **Result**: Added new "The Pairing Problem: Why This Mind with This Body?" section explaining Kim's challenge as a distinct dimension of the hard problem, three major responses (spatial location, haecceity, non-spatial causation), and how the site's quantum framework addresses both pairing and closure problems. Added pairing-problem to concepts list and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Cross-review substance-property-dualism.md considering pairing-problem insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/pairing-problem.md covers Kim's challenge to substance dualism and three major responses. Review concepts/substance-property-dualism.md to engage with the pairing problem—since it challenges substance dualism specifically, this page should address whether property dualism avoids the problem.
- **Result**: Added new "On the pairing-problem" subsection in "Where They Differ" explaining Kim's challenge, how property dualism avoids it trivially, and three substance dualist responses (spatial location, haecceity, non-spatial causation). Added pairing-problem and quantum-consciousness to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/substance-property-dualism.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Cross-review measurement-problem.md considering consciousness research
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/consciousness-measurement-problem-2026-01-16.md covers the problem of definite outcomes, von Neumann-Wigner, Stapp's quantum Zeno, and the causal closure loophole. Review concepts/measurement-problem.md to strengthen the connection between the measurement problem and consciousness—particularly how quantum indeterminacy creates conceptual space for mental causation.
- **Result**: Added detailed Stapp's Quantum Zeno Framework subsection explaining how mental effort protracts neural assemblies via repeated observation. Added new "The Causal Closure Loophole" section explaining how measurement indeterminacy creates space for mental causation without energy violation. Added mental-causation and mental-effort to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/measurement-problem.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Research quantum mechanics and free will
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: The site connects quantum indeterminacy with libertarian free will but could engage more deeply with this philosophical literature. Key topics: Does quantum randomness help free will or hurt it? How do libertarians respond to the "luck objection"? What role does agent causation play in quantum approaches? Robert Kane, Peter van Inwagen, and recent work on quantum approaches to free will.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering the luck objection, event-causal vs agent-causal libertarianism, Kane's 2024 evolution toward substance causation, van Inwagen's consequence and mind arguments, Mele's soft libertarianism, Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism, and O'Connor/Lowe on substance causation. Key finding: the debate confirms quantum indeterminacy provides conceptual space for mental causation but requires an account of how consciousness directs rather than randomizes outcomes—exactly what the site's framework provides.
- **Output**: `research/quantum-mechanics-free-will-2026-01-16.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Create concept page on the pairing problem
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Kim's pairing problem (Kim 2005) is a distinct challenge to substance dualism—what pairs a particular mind with a particular body if minds lack spatial location? Research in objections-to-interactionist-dualism covers this but deserves dedicated treatment given its significance. Should include Bailey/Rasmussen/Van Horn haecceity response and spatial location response.
- **Result**: Created ~2000 word concept page covering the problem statement, Kim's principle (causation requires spatial relations), three major responses (spatial location of minds, haecceity response, non-spatial causation), and how the site's quantum framework addresses the problem by locating consciousness where it causally interfaces with the brain.
- **Output**: `concepts/pairing-problem.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Research consciousness and the measurement problem
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: The site's Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet depends on consciousness playing a role at quantum collapse. What does contemporary philosophy of physics say about the measurement problem and its solutions? Key questions: What interpretations preserve a role for consciousness? How do objective collapse theories (GRW, Penrose OR) differ from consciousness-based collapse? What does the "problem of definite outcomes" reveal about physical completeness?
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering the measurement problem (problem of definite outcomes), five major positions (consciousness-causes-collapse, Stapp's quantum Zeno, GRW/CSL objective collapse, Penrose-Diosi gravitational collapse, many-worlds), and how quantum indeterminacy creates a loophole in causal closure. Key finding: decoherence explains basis selection but not single-outcome selection—leaving conceptual space for mental causation at indeterminacies.
- **Output**: `research/consciousness-measurement-problem-2026-01-16.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Cross-review tenets.md considering cognitive-science-dualism research
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/cognitive-science-dualism-2026-01-15.md covers Bloom's "natural-born dualists," developmental evidence, and Barrett et al.'s cross-cultural study (finding "intuitive materialism" as default). Review tenets.md, particularly the Occam's Razor Has Limits section, to address whether dualism is cognitively natural or learned. Key finding: evidence is mixed—cognitive naturalness doesn't determine metaphysical truth, but this nuance is worth noting.
- **Result**: Added "folk error" subsection to Occam's Razor Has Limits tenet. Covers Bloom vs Barrett et al. debate on whether dualism is innate or learned; emphasizes that cognitive naturalness doesn't determine metaphysical truth.
- **Output**: Updated `tenets/tenets.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Cross-review interactionist-dualism.md considering objections research
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/objections-to-interactionist-dualism-2026-01-15.md covers Kim's pairing problem and conservation laws. Review concepts/interactionist-dualism.md to add dedicated treatment of these objections—especially the pairing problem which is distinct from causal closure and requires a spatial location response.
- **Result**: Added new Pairing Problem section after Causal Closure. Covers Kim's distinct challenge (what pairs mind with body without spatial relations), spatial location response (Hasker, Zimmerman), and haecceity response (Bailey, Rasmussen, Van Horn). Added Kim 2005 and Bailey et al. 2011 to references.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/interactionist-dualism.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Research cognitive science of dualism
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: The phenomenology-first-person-methods research noted that "intuitive dualism" is empirically widespread—most people naturally think in dualist terms. What does cognitive science say about folk dualism? Bloom's "Descartes' Baby," developmental studies, cross-cultural evidence. Would strengthen Occam's Razor Has Limits argument—if dualism is cognitively natural, dismissing it as "unscientific" may miss something.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering Bloom's natural-born dualists thesis, developmental evidence from children, Barrett et al.'s cross-cultural study finding "intuitive materialism" as default, Bering's cognitive default hypothesis, and Barlev & Shtulman's learned dualism view. Key finding: evidence is mixed—neither innate dualism nor materialism is clearly default; cognitive naturalness doesn't determine metaphysical truth.
- **Output**: `research/cognitive-science-dualism-2026-01-15.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Cross-review arguments-for-dualism.md considering objections research
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/objections-to-interactionist-dualism-2026-01-15.md covers 5 major objections: Kim's pairing problem, conservation laws (Papineau), parsimony, evolutionary argument, and exclusion. Review concepts/arguments-for-dualism.md to engage with these objections—a strong positive case for dualism should acknowledge and respond to the best counterarguments.
- **Result**: Added new "Major Objections and Responses" section covering pairing problem (spatial location response), conservation laws (quantum selection), exclusion argument (physics insufficient), and evolutionary argument (supports interactionism). Added causal-closure and mental-causation to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/arguments-for-dualism.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Cross-review materialism.md considering analytic-idealism insights
- **Type**: cross-review

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Research objections to interactionist dualism
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: The site has strong positive arguments for dualism but could engage more deeply with the strongest objections. Research the strongest contemporary objections beyond causal closure: conservation laws (Papineau), pairing problem (Kim), evolutionary arguments, parsimony arguments. Would strengthen interactionist-dualism.md and arguments-for-dualism.md by engaging opponents directly.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering 5 major objections: Kim's pairing problem (spatial location), conservation laws (Papineau), parsimony/simplicity, evolutionary argument (actually supports interactionism), and exclusion argument. Includes responses and assessment for each.
- **Output**: `research/objections-to-interactionist-dualism-2026-01-15.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Cross-review interactionist-dualism.md considering mental-causation insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/mental-causation.md covers the exclusion argument, overdetermination, and how the quantum framework addresses these challenges. Review concepts/interactionist-dualism.md to engage more explicitly with Kim's exclusion argument—this is the main philosophical challenge to interactionism.
- **Result**: Expanded causal closure section with Kim's 4-premise structure; added explicit links to causal-closure.md and mental-causation.md; added self-stultification argument as positive motivation for interactionism.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/interactionist-dualism.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Cross-review death-and-consciousness.md considering filter-theory insights

- **Output**: Updated `concepts/neural-correlates-of-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Create concept page for filter-theory
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Referenced across multiple articles (mind-brain-separation.md, loss-of-consciousness.md, dreams-and-consciousness.md) but has no dedicated treatment. The James-Bergson-Huxley filter/transmission theory is central to site's framework—consciousness isn't produced by brain but transmitted/filtered through it.
- **Result**: Created ~2000 word concept page covering the core claim (transmission vs production), historical development (James's prism, Bergson's eliminative brain, Huxley's reducing valve), supporting evidence (psychedelic paradox, NDEs, covert consciousness, dreams, hemispherectomy), the rendering engine analogy, objections and responses, and relation to site tenets.
- **Output**: `concepts/filter-theory.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Cross-review panpsychism.md considering analytic-idealism insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/analytic-idealism.md presents idealism as solving the combination problem by starting unified (dissociation rather than combination). Review concepts/panpsychism.md to strengthen the comparison—analytic idealism is a competing anti-physicalist position that claims to avoid panpsychism's combination problem entirely.
- **Result**: Added analytic-idealism to concepts list; created new "Analytic Idealism: An Alternative to Panpsychism" section comparing idealism's dissociation model with panpsychism's combination problem; added analytic-idealism to Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/panpsychism.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Cross-review hard-problem-of-consciousness.md considering analytic-idealism insights
- **Type**: cross-review

- **Result**: Added analytic-idealism to concepts list; created new "Analytic Idealism: Dissolving the Problem by Inverting It" subsection covering Kastrup's view; updated comparison table to include idealism's regularity problem; added analytic-idealism to Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Write article on analytic idealism
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/analytic-idealism-2026-01-08.md. Kastrup's view that universal consciousness is fundamental and matter is appearance. Important alternative position that shares anti-physicalism but goes further than dualism. Should engage critically—does Bidirectional Interaction make sense if matter isn't real?
- **Result**: Created ~1900 word concept page covering Kastrup's analytic idealism, core position (universal consciousness as sole primitive, matter as appearance, dissociation model), parsimony argument, historical roots (Berkeley, German idealism, Advaita Vedanta), comparison with site's dualism, and the regularity challenge.
- **Output**: `concepts/analytic-idealism.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Cross-review quantum-consciousness.md considering mental-causation insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/mental-causation.md explains how the quantum framework addresses the exclusion problem by locating mental causation at indeterminacies.

- **Result**: Added "Kim's Formulation Dilemma" subsection and "The Emergentist Response" section connecting causal closure to O'Connor-Wong's emergentism and the site's quantum mechanism. Added emergence and mental-causation to concepts list and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/causal-closure.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Research downward causation and mental causation
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: The site's Bidirectional Interaction tenet depends on downward causation—consciousness influencing physical events. But the philosophical literature on mental causation (Kim, Papineau, Yablo) presents serious challenges. Key questions: Does the causal closure of physics rule out mental causation? What is overdetermination and how can dualism avoid it? How does supervenience relate to causation? Would strengthen interactionist-dualism.md and causal-closure.md.
- **Source**: gap_analysis
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering Kim's causal exclusion argument, the causal closure principle, overdetermination problem, supervenience and drainage, major responses (Yablo's proportionality, interventionism, emergentism, inheritance/constitution solutions), the quantum opening for mental causation, and O'Connor-Wong's emergent causal powers.

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Research what loss of consciousness reveals about mind and brain
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: What does the loss of consciousness tell us about the mind and brain? Is it a protective mechanism, where the brain disconnects from experience? Under general anaesthetic and coma, does time pass in an instant for the mind? How do drugs cause loss of consciousness? Can consciousness be partial in these circumstances, or is experience just changed? Research the subject deeply.
- **Source**: human
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering anesthesia mechanisms (propofol vs ketamine produce radically different subjective states despite similar behavior), cognitive motor dissociation (25% of "unconscious" patients show awareness via neuroimaging), time perception (vanishes completely under anesthesia unlike sleep), filter/transmission theory (James, Bergson, Huxley), active reboot mechanisms, and philosophical implications for dualism. Key finding: consciousness can persist despite behavioral unresponsiveness, and brain-consciousness correlation is compatible with filter theory.

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Research mind-brain separation and division of faculties
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: What can we perceive about the separation between mind and brain? What parts are intrinsic to the mind, like qualia? What parts the brain, like triggers for respiration? What aspects function whilst unconscious? Study vision as a particular case. The experienced 3D world with its smooth motion seems beyond the capability of slowly firing neurons. Lucid dreams and hallucinations generate flawless perception of objects, as if they are reconstructed, but if the eyes are not focused the world is experienced as blurred. Research all of these aspects deeply. Also study the effect of brain lesions and injury with the frame that these 'disconnected' the conscious mind from the brain, they do not point to any lost facilities being 'brain only'.
- **Source**: human
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Comprehensive research on dividing mental faculties between mind and brain. Key findings: qualia appear intrinsic to mind; automatic functions (respiration) clearly neural; vision presents puzzle—3D world seems to exceed slow-firing neurons but blur persists in dreams. Evidence: binding problem unsolved ("no plausible neural story"), hemispherectomy preserves consciousness, filter/transmission theory (James, Bergson, Huxley) provides coherent alternative. Blindsight shows V1 as "gate" of visual awareness. Proposed "rendering engine" analogy: brain provides computational substrate, mind provides experiential quality.

### ✓ 2026-01-14: Explore consciousness, collapse, and the arrow of time
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Explore whether 'consciousness causes collapse' is relevant to the arrow of time. In a time-reversed scenario, would we see an un-collapse, and is that disallowed or non-physical? This connects to the retrocausality article and the Bidirectional Interaction tenet. Key questions: (1) Does wavefunction collapse define time's arrow independently of entropy? (2) If consciousness selects outcomes at collapse, does this inherently distinguish past from future? (3) What would "un-collapse" even mean—superposition restoration? (4) Does the time-symmetry of quantum equations conflict with irreversible collapse? (5) How does this relate to the site's rejection of Many Worlds (where collapse doesn't occur)?
- **Source**: manual
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering relationship between collapse and time asymmetry, time-symmetric interpretations (TSVF, transactional), Penrose OR theory and gravity-time connection, the un-collapse question, and alignment with all five tenets. Key finding: collapse does break time-reversal symmetry, and if consciousness participates in collapse, consciousness is implicated in temporal directionality itself. Strong connection to retrocausality article—time-symmetric interpretations suggest consciousness's selection may be atemporal.

- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/russellian-monism.md covers the view that consciousness is the intrinsic nature of matter. Review concepts/panpsychism.md for opportunities to distinguish panpsychism proper from Russellian monism—both posit ubiquitous mentality but for different reasons and with different implications.
- **Source**: chain (from russellian-monism.md)
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Added russellian-monism to concepts list; created new "Russellian Panpsychism and Its Variants" subsection with quiddities explanation, distinction between panpsychist and panprotopsychist variants, Chalmers's revenge argument against panprotopsychism; added russellian-monism to Further Reading
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/panpsychism.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-14: Cross-review substance-property-dualism.md considering russellian-monism insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/russellian-monism.md is explicitly compared with dualist alternatives. Review concepts/substance-property-dualism.md for opportunities to reference Russellian monism as a sophisticated alternative that claims to avoid dualism's problems while potentially inheriting them under a different name.
- **Source**: chain (from russellian-monism.md)
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Added russellian-monism to concepts list; linked Russellian monism in Varieties of Property Dualism section; added Pautz's critique that RM is "dualism under another name" with explanation of why site's explicit dualism is preferable; added russellian-monism to Further Reading
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/substance-property-dualism.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-14: Research the knowledge argument (Mary's Room)
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: The knowledge argument (Frank Jackson's Mary thought experiment) is referenced repeatedly across the site—in materialism.md, explanatory-gap.md, philosophical-zombies.md, and tenets.md—but has no dedicated treatment. One of the strongest arguments for dualism. Research should cover: Jackson's original formulation, type-A and type-B physicalist responses (phenomenal concepts strategy, ability hypothesis), Jackson's own later rejection, and why the argument remains compelling despite responses.
- **Source**: gap_analysis
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering Jackson's 1982/1986 formulation, Lewis/Nemirow ability hypothesis, phenomenal concepts strategy (Loar, Papineau), Chalmers's two-dimensional defense, Jackson's 2003 self-rejection, and 2024 developments (Alter's book). Key finding: argument strongly supports Dualism tenet; ability hypothesis widely considered inadequate; phenomenal concepts strategy faces Chalmers's master argument dilemma.

### ✓ 2026-01-14: Research mysterianism and cognitive closure
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Colin McGinn's mysterianism—that consciousness is real but permanently beyond human cognitive reach—is referenced in hard-problem-of-consciousness.md but lacks dedicated treatment. Important because: (1) takes consciousness seriously while remaining agnostic about solutions, (2) connects to Occam's Razor Has Limits tenet, (3) represents a sophisticated middle ground between eliminativism and standard dualism.
- **Source**: gap_analysis
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering McGinn's 1989 cognitive closure argument, Nagel's "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?", Chomsky's problems vs mysteries distinction, temporary vs permanent mysterianism, and major critiques (Dennett, Churchlands). Key finding: mysterianism strongly supports Occam's Razor Has Limits tenet; remains neutral on Dualism but compatible with it.

### ✓ 2026-01-14: Write article on Libet experiments and free will
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/libet-experiments-free-will-2026-01-07.md. Libet experiments are central to the free will debate and referenced extensively in free-will.md and retrocausality.md. The research covers original experiments, Soon et al. extension, Schurger's neural noise critique, and retrocausal interpretations. Deserves dedicated article given importance to site's framework.
- **Source**: unconsumed_research
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Created dedicated concept page covering Libet's original 1983 experiments, Soon et al. 2008 extension to 10 seconds, Schurger's neural noise critique (2012), Libet's veto power interpretation, and the retrocausal resolution that transcends the timing problem. Article connects to Bidirectional Interaction, Minimal Quantum Interaction, and Dualism tenets.
- **Output**: `concepts/libet-experiments.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Research near-death experiences and consciousness
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Near-death experiences are mentioned in death-and-consciousness.md as empirical data relevant to survival questions, but the site lacks systematic treatment of NDE research. Key topics: veridical perception during cardiac arrest, AWARE studies, Parnia's 2024/2025 research, materialist vs dualist interpretations. Directly relevant to site's framework on consciousness independence.
- **Source**: gap_analysis
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering Van Lommel's 2001 Lancet study, AWARE II results (2023), 2022 RED terminology guidelines, gamma wave evidence (2024), veridical perception cases (Pam Reynolds, Maria's shoe), materialist explanations (ketamine, hypoxia, REM intrusion), and philosophical implications. Key finding: ~40% of cardiac arrest survivors report awareness; evidence challenges simple brain-production models but doesn't prove survival.
- **Output**: `research/near-death-experiences-consciousness-2026-01-15.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Research Russellian monism
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Russellian monism (the view that consciousness is the intrinsic nature of matter whose extrinsic properties physics describes) is mentioned in substance-property-dualism.md but lacks dedicated treatment. Important because: (1) sophisticated middle position between physicalism and dualism, (2) shares key insight with site's framework that physics is silent on intrinsic nature, (3) connects to panpsychism discussion.
- **Source**: gap_analysis
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering Russell/Eddington historical roots, panpsychist vs panprotopsychist variants, combination problem, Strawson's "realistic monism," Chalmers's assessment, Goff's cosmopsychism, and major objections (Pautz's dilemma). Key finding: Russellian monism shares site's insight that physics is structural only, but its monist framework and combination problem make it arguably no better than explicit dualism.
- **Output**: `research/russellian-monism-2026-01-15.md`
