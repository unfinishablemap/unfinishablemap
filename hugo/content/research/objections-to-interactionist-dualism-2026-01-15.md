Research notes on the strongest philosophical objections to interactionist dualism beyond causal closure. Gathered to strengthen engagement with critics and identify responses the site should develop.

## 1. Kim's Pairing Problem

Jaegwon Kim's pairing problem (Kim 2005) presents a distinct challenge to substance dualism beyond causal closure.

### The Problem

Consider two minds M1 and M2 and bodies B1 and B2 with which they interact. Both M1 and M2 desire to raise their hand. M1's desire causes B1's hand to rise; M2's desire causes B2's hand to rise. But *in virtue of what* is M1 paired with B1 rather than B2?

For physical events, spatial location provides the pairing relation. The billiard ball strikes *this* ball because they occupy adjacent spatial positions. But if minds are non-spatial (as traditional substance dualism holds), no spatial relation can pair them with particular bodies.

### Kim's Principle

Kim argues that "causal relations between physical objects or events appear to depend crucially on their spatiotemporal relations to each other." If causation requires spatial relations, and minds lack spatial location, minds cannot enter into causal relations at all—whether with bodies or with each other.

### Responses

**1. Spatial Location of Minds**: Some dualists (Hasker, Zimmerman) accept that minds/souls occupy spatial locations—specifically, the region occupied by the brain. This dissolves the pairing problem: M1 is paired with B1 because M1 occupies B1's brain region.

Kim objects: what prevents two intrinsically indiscernible souls from occupying the same region? Dualists would need an analogue to the impenetrability of matter for souls.

**2. Deny Kim's Dictum**: Andrew Bailey, Joshua Rasmussen, and Luke Van Horn (2011) argue there is "no pairing problem." They present a dilemma: either haecceities (primitive thisness) exist or they don't. If they exist, haecceities can ground the pairing relation without spatial location. If they don't, the pairing problem generalizes to all causation and isn't a special problem for dualism.

**3. Non-Spatial Causation**: Some argue causation needn't require spatial relations. Abstract objects (numbers, propositions) may enter into causal explanations without spatial location. If so, Kim's principle is too strong.

### Assessment

The pairing problem is distinct from and potentially stronger than causal closure objections. Even granting that consciousness could affect physics at quantum indeterminacies, the question remains: why does *this* consciousness affect *this* body? the site should address this explicitly.

**Potential response**: The quantum interactionist can hold that minds are spatially located (in the brain region where quantum effects occur) without abandoning dualism. The distinctiveness of consciousness is metaphysical, not spatial.

## 2. Conservation Laws Objection

Since Leibniz, critics argue that mind-body interaction violates conservation of energy and momentum.

### The Argument

1. Conservation laws state that energy (and momentum) in a closed system remains constant
2. If mind causally affects body, energy must enter the physical system from outside
3. This violates conservation laws
4. Therefore, minds cannot causally affect bodies

### Papineau's Formulation

David Papineau (2001) develops this as an argument *for* causal closure rather than *against* dualism directly:

**Argument from Conservation**: All known physical forces reduce to a small stock of conservative forces. Induction suggests mental forces (if they existed) would also be conservative—but if they're conservative, they're physical.

**Argument from Physiology**: Two centuries of neuroscience reveals no trace of non-physical forces. If such forces existed, we would observe anomalous particle accelerations.

### Responses

**1. Closed System Assumption**: Conservation applies only to closed systems. Dualists deny the brain is causally closed. But critics note this seems ad hoc—what marks brain boundaries as special?

**2. Energy Types Aren't Specified**: Conservation laws don't dictate *what kinds* of energy exist. If "psychic energy" exists and operates conservatively (transforms rather than appearing/disappearing), no violation occurs. Tim O'Connor suggests consciousness might *redirect* energy without adding it.

**3. Quantum Exception**: At quantum indeterminacies, consciousness could select among possible outcomes without adding energy. The outcomes all have the same energy; consciousness just determines *which* one actualizes. This is the site's primary response via Minimal Quantum Interaction.

**4. Conservation is Local**: Robins Collins (2011) argues conservation isn't ubiquitous in physics. Energy isn't conserved in general relativity (no global time symmetry), in quantum field theory (vacuum fluctuations), or in the expanding universe. Conservation is local and approximate.

**5. Noether's Theorem Consideration**: Conservation follows from symmetry (Noether). If non-physical influence breaks symmetry locally, conservation fails locally. This doesn't violate physics—physics correctly predicts conservation where symmetry holds.

### Assessment

The quantum opening is the strongest response: consciousness selects among equi-energetic possibilities. No energy is added; the conservation equations are satisfied. Critics would need to show that *outcome selection* requires energy injection, which is not obvious given the indeterministic character of quantum mechanics.

## 3. Parsimony/Simplicity Objection

Physicalism is simpler than dualism, therefore preferable by Occam's Razor.

### The Argument

1. Parsimony favors theories with fewer ontological commitments
2. Physicalism posits only physical substances; dualism posits physical and mental substances
3. Therefore, physicalism is more parsimonious
4. All else being equal, prefer physicalism

### Responses

**1. All Else Isn't Equal**: Parsimony applies only when theories have equal explanatory power. Physicalism notoriously struggles with consciousness (hard problem, explanatory gap). A simpler theory that *doesn't explain the data* isn't preferable.

**2. Type vs. Token Parsimony**: Dualism adds one ontological *type* (mind), not millions of *tokens*. Adding one well-motivated category isn't extravagant parsimony violation. Physics itself posits multiple fundamental types (fermions, bosons) without parsimony complaint.

**3. Consciousness as Datum**: If consciousness is real and irreducible (which experience suggests), then ignoring it isn't parsimony—it's ignoring evidence. Parsimony means not multiplying entities *beyond necessity*. If consciousness cannot be reduced to physics, its acknowledgment is necessary.

**4. Occam's Razor Has Limits**: This is the site's fifth tenet. Parsimony is a methodological heuristic, not a metaphysical truth. It can mislead when we lack complete information. The apparent simplicity of physicalism may reflect our ignorance rather than reality.

### Assessment

The parsimony objection is weak if consciousness really is irreducible. One cannot achieve parsimony by ignoring evidence. the site should emphasize that apparent simplicity doesn't guarantee truth, and that the hard problem gives strong evidence consciousness isn't physical.

## 4. Evolutionary Argument

Often presented as objecting to dualism, this argument actually targets *epiphenomenalism* and supports *interactionism*.

### The Argument (William James 1890)

1. Pleasures correlate with survival-beneficial stimuli; pains with harmful stimuli
2. This correlation requires evolutionary explanation
3. Natural selection can only favor traits with causal effects on behavior
4. Therefore, consciousness has causal effects (contra epiphenomenalism)
5. Therefore, interactionism (or physicalism) is true; epiphenomenalism is false

### Key Point

This argument *supports* the site's position. Interactionist dualism holds that consciousness causes physical effects—exactly what the evolutionary argument requires. The argument targets only those forms of dualism (epiphenomenalism, parallelism) that deny mental causation.

### Epiphenomenalist Response

Frank Jackson suggests consciousness might be a "spandrel"—a by-product of neural processes that were themselves selected for. Consciousness would be correlated with beneficial behaviors without causing them.

**Counter-response**: This explains why consciousness *exists* (as spandrel) but not why the pain/pleasure correlations are so precise. Why should a causally inert spandrel track fitness so accurately?

### Assessment

This objection has no force against interactionist dualism. the site can use it *offensively* against epiphenomenalism: if consciousness doesn't cause behavior, evolution can't explain the observed correlations.

## 5. The Exclusion Argument (Beyond Causal Closure)

Kim's exclusion argument goes beyond simple causal closure to argue that even if there's room for mental causation, mental properties would be "excluded" by physical properties.

### The Structure

1. Supervenience: Mental properties supervene on physical properties (no mental difference without physical difference)
2. Causal relevance: If mental property M supervenes on physical property P, and P is sufficient for effect E, then M seems causally redundant
3. Exclusion: P "screens off" M from E—P does all the causal work
4. Therefore: M either is identical to P (reductionism) or causes nothing (epiphenomenalism)

### The Drainage Problem

Kim calls this "causal drainage"—efficacy drains from higher levels to lower levels, pooling at fundamental physics. This threatens not just mental causation but all higher-level causation (temperature, pressure, biological properties).

### Responses

**1. Levels Response**: Mental and physical descriptions capture the same causal process at different levels. There aren't two competing causes but one cause under two descriptions.

**2. Proportionality (Yablo)**: Mental properties may be more *proportional* causes—neither too specific nor too general. "Being in pain" may be the right level of description for explaining avoidance behavior; neural details may be over-specific.

**3. Interventionism (Woodward)**: Causes are factors whose manipulation would change effects. Mental properties can satisfy this criterion even alongside physical realizers.

**4. Quantum Insufficiency**: the site's response. At quantum indeterminacies, P is *not* sufficient for E—physics determines probabilities but not outcomes. M can be causally relevant without competing with sufficient physical causes.

### Assessment

The exclusion argument assumes that physical properties provide *sufficient* causes. The quantum response denies this at indeterminacies. Where physics is genuinely incomplete, mental properties can fill the gap without exclusion.

## Summary Table

| Objection | Target | Site's Response |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Pairing problem | Substance dualism | Minds are spatially located (in brains) |
| Conservation laws | Interactionism | Quantum selection without energy injection |
| Parsimony | Dualism | Consciousness is evidence; ignoring it isn't parsimonious |
| Evolutionary argument | Epiphenomenalism | *Supports* interactionism |
| Exclusion argument | Mental causation | Physics insufficient at quantum indeterminacies |

## Implications for Site Content

1. **interactionist-dualism.md**: Should explicitly address the pairing problem, not just causal closure
2. **arguments-for-dualism.md**: Could note that the evolutionary argument actually supports interactionism
3. **causal-closure.md**: Already covers exclusion; could add conservation law discussion
4. **tenets.md**: The Occam's Razor Has Limits tenet directly addresses parsimony objection
