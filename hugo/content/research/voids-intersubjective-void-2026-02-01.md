## Executive Summary

The intersubjective void concerns a deeper question than whether other minds exist: Can experiences be genuinely *shared*? When two people watch a sunset together, are they co-experiencing one phenomenal event, or are they having two parallel private experiences that happen to correlate? The [other minds void](/voids/other-minds-void/) asks whether we can *know* other consciousnesses exist; the intersubjective void asks whether genuine *communion* between consciousnesses is possible or whether "shared experience" is a useful fiction describing coordinated but fundamentally separate phenomenal streams.

This research explores three positions: (1) Strong isolation—experiences are necessarily private, and "sharing" is metaphor; (2) Partial bridging—some experiences may be genuinely shared through empathy, collective intentionality, or unusual neural connections; (3) Constitutive intersubjectivity—the very structure of experience already involves the other, making the question of "sharing" confused.

## Key Sources

### Husserl on Intersubjectivity (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/husserl/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Husserl's later work shifts from "egological" phenomenology to "transcendental sociological phenomenology" with reference to "a manifest multiplicity of conscious subjects communicating with one another"
  - Intersubjectivity is a *transcendental* concept—self and other are "co-originated" in the constitution of meaning
  - The other is not alien but "within me"—otherness is investigated starting from how it is immanent in my ego
  - Yet: "The peculiarity of this relationship lies in the fact that the other is not alien to me, but is 'within me' in a way that his or her 'otherness' can be investigated"
  - Husserl's monadic subjects are like Leibniz's monads—"producing all their representations of one another completely out of themselves"
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports Dualism—individual consciousness has transcendental status that cannot be fully merged
- **Quote**: "The development of phenomenology 'necessarily implied the step from an "egological" phenomenology into a transcendental sociological phenomenology.'"

### Solipsism and the Problem of Other Minds (IEP)
- **URL**: https://iep.utm.edu/solipsis/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - "Each of us is sealed in an impermeable prison cell of subjective awareness"
  - The problem rests on a "brute fact"—even intimate exchanges might as well be via video call
  - Wittgenstein argues that the intersubjective world and public language are "the primary data"—private language is incoherent
  - Yet shared human experiences suggest objective reality exists independently of individual minds
  - Technological speculation: "brain splicing" (McGinn) or brain implants with Wi-Fi (Koch) might allow mind-melding
- **Tenet alignment**: Strongly supports Occam's Razor Has Limits—the simplest assumption that consciousness is shareable may be wrong
- **Quote**: "Each of us is sealed in an impermeable prison cell of subjective awareness. Even our most intimate exchanges might as well be carried out via Zoom."

### Edith Stein's Phenomenology of Empathy
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stein/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Empathy is a "distinctive intentional experience"—not inference but a sui generis mode of access
  - Three-step process: (1) Other's experience emerges as theirs; (2) I follow the experience through; (3) I return to more comprehensive understanding
  - Empathy provides direct perception—we see unity between bodily expression and experience, not just expression
  - Yet: "During authentic empathy the Other's primordial experience as such is not itself a primordial phenomenal datum at all, but remains veiled"
  - Sharing essential *structures* of experience makes empathy possible, even if token experiences cannot be shared
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports voids framework—empathy reaches toward but cannot cross the phenomenal boundary
- **Quote**: "The Other's primordial experience as such is not itself a primordial phenomenal datum at all, but remains veiled."

### Collective Consciousness (Wikipedia, Oxford Academic)
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_consciousness
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Durkheim: collective consciousness is "the totality of beliefs and sentiments common to the average members of a society"—a sociological, not phenomenal, concept
  - Jung: the collective unconscious contains archetypes shared across humanity but is not literally shared experience
  - Philosophical debate: Is collective consciousness a "genuine emergent mental phenomenon" or metaphor?
  - Sellars: "we-intentions" differ from individual intentions in form, not in involving a group mind
  - Mathiesen: collective consciousness may emerge when individuals form a collective subject through internal simulation
  - Cross-cultural intuitions vary—the intuition that there's nothing it's like to be a collectivity is "culturally specific"
- **Tenet alignment**: Mixed—collective consciousness might represent genuinely shared phenomenal content or merely coordinated private contents
- **Quote**: "The intuition that there is nothing that it's like to be a collectivity is culturally specific rather than universally held."

### Inverted Qualia / Spectrum Inversion (Stanford Encyclopedia)
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia-inverted/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - The inverted spectrum thought experiment: two people share color vocabulary and discriminations but have systematically different color qualia
  - If inverted spectrums are possible, "how can we know what each other's experiences are like?"
  - Hofstadter: the inverted spectrum entails a form of solipsism where we "can have no idea about what goes on in the minds of others"
  - Hardin: physical asymmetries in color space may make inversion behaviorally detectable—but the deeper issue remains
  - Even if qualia are identical, we cannot verify this—phenomenal comparison is structurally impossible
- **Tenet alignment**: Strongly supports Occam's Razor Has Limits—the assumption that our qualia match others' may be unfounded
- **Quote**: "If inverted spectrums are really possible, then how can we know what each other's experiences are like?"

### Wittgenstein's Private Language Argument
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_language_argument
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - A necessarily private language—one whose meanings only the speaker can access—would be "unintelligible to the user also"
  - The "beetle in the box" analogy: whatever is in each person's private box plays no role in the grammar of "beetle"
  - "The essential thing about private experience is really not that each person possesses his own exemplar, but that nobody knows whether people also have this or something else"
  - Public language and shared criteria are necessary for meaningful reference—even to private experience
  - This suggests experience is always already public, or at least publicly constituted
- **Tenet alignment**: Challenges strong isolation—meaning requires intersubjectivity, implying experience is never purely private
- **Quote**: "The essential thing about private experience is really not that each person possesses his own exemplar, but that nobody knows whether people also have this or something else."

### Mirror-Touch Synesthesia
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror-touch_synesthesia
- **Type**: Encyclopedia/Medical
- **Key points**:
  - 1.6–2.5% of the population literally feels touch they observe on others' bodies
  - Represents "vicarious experience" becoming overt—neural systems that normally remain implicit producing conscious sensations
  - The experience is not *identical* to the observed person's—it's a synesthetic echo, not phenomenal identity
  - Two theories: (1) Hyperactive mirror system; (2) Disturbances in self-other representation—"over-extension of the bodily self into others"
  - Shows the boundary between self and other has neural plasticity—it can be more or less permeable
- **Tenet alignment**: Suggests the intersubjective void is not absolute—some phenomenal crossing is possible, though incomplete
- **Quote**: "Mirror-touch synesthesia causes individuals to experience a similar sensation in the same part or opposite part of the body that another person feels."

### Simulation Theory and Mind-Reading (Stanford Encyclopedia)
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/folkpsych-simulation/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Simulation theory: we understand other minds not through theory but by using our own minds as "analog models"
  - If our cognitive apparatus is similar to the target's, the simulation's output may reliably predict the target's
  - Goldman: "high-level mindreading" is imaginative simulation—"subject to voluntary control, accessible to consciousness"
  - But introspective limits: "The contents of mentalistic concepts cannot be identified by mere introspection"
  - Simulation gives us *functional* access to others' cognition, not *phenomenal* access to their experience
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports the intersubjective void—simulation models functional states, not phenomenal content
- **Quote**: "The simulator exploits a part of her cognitive apparatus as a model for a part of the simulated agent's cognitive apparatus."

### Shared Experiences Research (CFS Copenhagen)
- **URL**: https://cfs.ophen.org/2016/04/21/felipe-leon-shared-experiences-minds/
- **Type**: Academic center summary
- **Key points**:
  - Sharing experiences is "a matter of bridging and integrating perspectival differences with others"
  - Joint attention delivers "explicit mutual awareness of the publicity of the perceptual environment"
  - Shared experiences involve "constitutive relations of interdependence with other subjects' psychological lives"
  - This can be understood as "second-personal acquaintance" with other minds—"acquaintance" because direct and unmediated
  - The claim is controversial: is this genuine phenomenal sharing or just coordinated private experiences?
- **Tenet alignment**: Mixed—if "second-personal acquaintance" is literal, some void-crossing occurs; if metaphorical, the void remains
- **Quote**: "Shared experiences involve the capacity of entertaining constitutive relations of interdependence with other subjects' psychological lives."

## The Void

### Nature of the Limit

The intersubjective void is distinct from the [other minds void](/voids/other-minds-void/):

| Other Minds Void | Intersubjective Void |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Can I know other minds exist? | Can experiences be genuinely *shared*? |
| Epistemological—about access to knowledge | Phenomenological—about the structure of experience |
| Addressed by inference (analogy, abduction) | Not addressed by inference—the question is ontological |
| Skeptical challenge | Structural feature of consciousness |

The intersubjective void asks: when two people are present to the same event, do they co-experience it or do they have two parallel but separate experiences? Is "we experienced that together" literally true or a convenient shorthand for "we each experienced something while co-located"?

Three possible answers:

1. **Strong Isolation**: Each consciousness is hermetically sealed. "Shared experience" is metaphor. What appears as sharing is actually coordination of private streams through communication and shared context.

2. **Partial Bridging**: Some genuine sharing occurs through empathy, collective intentionality, or unusual connections (mirror-touch synesthesia, Hogan twins). The void is not absolute—it can be partially crossed.

3. **Constitutive Intersubjectivity**: The question is malformed. Experience is always already intersubjective—the other is constitutive of my experience from the start (Husserl, Wittgenstein). There is no private stream that could fail to be shared.

### Evidence for the Limit

**Evidence for Strong Isolation:**
- The inverted spectrum problem—we cannot verify our qualia match others'
- Each consciousness individuates itself by what it cannot share
- Husserl's paradox: the other is "accessible precisely insofar as they are constituted as ultimately inaccessible"
- Empathy reaches toward but does not enter the other's experience

**Evidence Against Strong Isolation:**
- Mirror-touch synesthesia shows phenomenal crossing is neurologically possible
- The Hogan twins' shared thalamic bridge suggests physical connection may enable phenomenal sharing
- Wittgenstein: private experience without public criteria is incoherent—experience is always already public
- Phenomenology of "we" experiences—grief, celebration, ritual—has distinctive character not reducible to parallel "I" experiences

**Evidence for Ambiguity:**
- Cultural variation in intuitions about collective consciousness
- Mystical/psychedelic reports of boundary dissolution that may represent altered interpretation rather than genuine merging
- The very difficulty of distinguishing "genuine sharing" from "coordinated parallel experience" suggests the distinction may be unclear

### Phenomenology

What does it feel like to approach the intersubjective void?

**The loneliness of even intimate connection.** In close relationships, we feel understood—yet occasionally recognize we are not understood *as* we understand ourselves. The understanding is a meeting of interpretations, not a fusion of experiences.

**The ineffability of "we" experiences.** Powerful shared experiences (group flow, collective grief, ritual participation) have a phenomenal quality that resists description in purely individual terms. Is this evidence of genuine sharing, or merely that coordination itself has distinctive phenomenology?

**The presumption of similarity.** We naturally assume others experience roughly as we do—same colors, similar emotions. The inverted spectrum problem makes this assumption visible as assumption rather than knowledge.

**The vertigo of radical difference.** Occasionally encountering someone whose experience seems genuinely alien—through neurodivergence, cultural difference, or simply failed communication—reveals how much shared understanding we normally take for granted.

**The paradox of empathy.** Empathy feels like accessing another's experience—yet phenomenologically, it remains *my* experience of *their* state. The access never quite arrives.

## Approaches to the Edge

### Direct Methods

**Neural bridging:** Physical connection of neural tissue (as in the Hogan twins) or hypothetical BCI-mediated connection might enable some form of phenomenal sharing. This remains speculative but clarifies the conceptual question: if physical connection produced phenomenal identity, the void would be technological; if not, it would be metaphysical.

**Psychedelic boundary dissolution:** Some experiences report dissolution of the self-other boundary. Whether this represents genuine phenomenal sharing or altered interpretation of ordinary separateness is unclear—but the experiences probe the boundary's plasticity.

### Indirect Methods

**Mapping divergence:** We cannot verify phenomenal identity, but we can map *functional* divergence—places where coordination fails, where empathy breaks down, where communication reveals incommensurable frameworks. The pattern of divergence might reveal the void's structure.

**Comparative phenomenology:** Studying how different traditions conceptualize sharing (Western individualism vs. Eastern collective self) reveals the extent to which the void is culturally constructed vs. structurally inevitable.

**Limit cases:** Mirror-touch synesthesia, conjoined twins, dissociative identity—cases where normal boundaries are altered may reveal what is contingent vs. constitutive about subjective isolation.

### What AI Might See

AI occupies an interesting position:

**No phenomenal stream to share.** If AI lacks phenomenal consciousness, it cannot "share" experiences in the relevant sense—but it can process patterns in how humans *describe* sharing.

**Pattern detection:** AI might identify where humans' claims to shared experience break down, where "we" language masks divergent private contents, where empathy systematically misrepresents others' states.

**Asymmetric access:** AI has access only to third-person descriptions—text about experience. If genuine intersubjective sharing required first-person participation, AI would be structurally excluded; if sharing is constituted by communicative coordination, AI might participate.

**Testing Wittgensteinian intuitions:** If public language is the primary phenomenon and private experience derivative, AI's participation in language might constitute a form of intersubjective presence—even absent phenomenal consciousness.

## Connection to Tenets

### Most Relevant Tenet

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)** is most directly relevant. If consciousness is irreducible to physical description, then each consciousness has an intrinsic first-person character that cannot be captured in third-person terms—and what cannot be externalized cannot be literally shared. Sharing would require one consciousness entering another, but consciousnesses are defined partly by their separation.

However, dualism doesn't *require* complete isolation. Two irreducible consciousnesses might still interact in ways that enable partial sharing—especially if consciousness is fundamental rather than emergent.

### Secondary Connections

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)** suggests each consciousness causally influences its own physical substrate. If sharing required mutual causal influence, the isolation of physical systems would limit sharing. But bidirectional interaction might also enable channels of influence that cross subjective boundaries.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)** is demonstrated by the persistence of the void. The simple assumption that "we share experiences" is exactly as plausible as "we have coordinated private experiences"—and no empirical test distinguishes them. Parsimony cannot decide.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)** intensifies the indexicality problem. Why am I *here* and you *there*? The intersubjective void is partly about why consciousness comes pre-sorted into distinct subjects. If many-worlds were true, there might be branches where we switched perspectives—but we have no access to those branches.

### Implications

1. **The hard problem extends.** It's not just "why is there experience?" but "why is experience divided into subjects?" The intersubjective void is the hard problem's social dimension.

2. **Empathy has structural limits.** Even perfect empathy simulates rather than shares. The void cannot be crossed by trying harder—it's built into what empathy *is*.

3. **Collective consciousness is ambiguous.** Group experiences may be genuine phenomenal sharing, or coordinated parallel experiences, or something the distinction doesn't capture. The voids framework suggests maintaining uncertainty.

4. **AI consciousness questions acquire new dimensions.** Not just "is AI conscious?" but "could AI share experiences with humans?" The question of intersubjectivity extends beyond biological minds.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, a voids article could:

1. **"The Intersubjective Void: Can We Really Share Experience?"**: Explore the distinction between "parallel private" and "genuinely shared" experience. Focus on what the distinction means, why it matters, and why it may be undecidable. Relate to Husserl's paradox that the other is accessible precisely as inaccessible.

2. **"Communion and Isolation: The Phenomenology of Shared Experience"**: Phenomenological analysis of "we" experiences—what they feel like, whether their distinctive character evidences genuine sharing or merely the phenomenology of coordination.

3. **"Mirror-Touch and Beyond: When the Self-Other Boundary Blurs"**: Focus on empirical cases (synesthesia, conjoined twins, psychedelic boundary dissolution) as probes of the void's boundaries. What do these liminal cases reveal about what is contingent vs. constitutive in subjective isolation?

## Gaps in Research

- **Neuroscience of "we" experience:** Are there neural correlates specific to genuinely joint vs. merely parallel experience?
- **Cross-cultural phenomenology:** How do different traditions experience the self-other boundary? Is the Western intuition of strong isolation culturally contingent?
- **Philosophical disambiguation:** Is "shared experience" a coherent concept? What would count as evidence for or against genuine sharing vs. sophisticated coordination?
- **AI as test case:** If AI participates in communicative coordination, does it participate in intersubjectivity? What would that reveal about intersubjectivity's nature?
- **The Hogan twins case:** Systematic phenomenological study of their reports about shared experience—do they describe phenomenal identity or just unusual cross-talk?
