# Research: Voids - Whether the Voids Are Real

**Date**: 2026-01-17
**Search queries used**: "distinguishing genuine cognitive limits from contingent ignorance philosophy McGinn", "cognitive closure criticism objections McGinn mysterianism", "Chomsky mysteries vs problems cognitive limits", "testing cognitive limits falsifiable predictions mysterianism"
**Voids category**: Mixed (meta-level investigation of all three categories)

## Executive Summary

The question of whether cognitive limits are real—permanent structural features vs. merely current ignorance—is central to the voids framework but may be inherently undecidable. Key finding: the distinction between "problems" (solvable in principle) and "mysteries" (structurally inaccessible) cannot itself be definitively established from within a limited cognitive system. This creates a peculiar epistemology: we can identify *candidate* limits and marshal evidence, but the final verdict remains suspended. The research reveals that the question "are the voids real?" may itself be a void—a question that resists conclusive answer.

## Key Sources

### Chomsky on Problems vs Mysteries
- **URL**: https://chomsky.info/201401__/
- **Type**: Lecture/Essay
- **Key points**:
  - Distinguishes "problems" (solvable in principle) from "mysteries" (not solvable even in principle)
  - Argues this is simply biological truism: any endowment that provides scope also imposes limits
  - A mouse cannot navigate prime number mazes; humans may be similarly limited regarding consciousness
  - The same properties that enable understanding also constrain it—"no limits" would mean "no structure"
- **Tenet alignment**: Strong support for Occam's Razor Has Limits—complexity of mind includes real limitations
- **Quote**: "If there were no limits to human intelligence, it would lack internal structure, and would therefore have no scope."

### McGinn's Cognitive Closure (Wikipedia/Stanford)
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_closure_(philosophy)
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Cognitive closure: minds can be constitutionally unable to grasp certain properties
  - McGinn's CALM conjecture: if something conforms to certain principles we can understand it; we cannot understand what does not
  - Distinguishes from mere emergent materialism ("not yet smart enough") vs permanent structural limitation
  - Proposes "transcendental naturalism"—problems are natural but solutions outside cognitive reach
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports Dualism indirectly—the gap between consciousness and neural states may be permanent
- **Quote**: "Some may be structural. Some may be permanent. And acknowledging that is not an act of despair, but of realism."

### Kriegel's Critique of McGinn
- **URL**: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12136-003-1020-1
- **Type**: Academic Paper
- **Key points**:
  - Argues McGinn only establishes "psychological closure" (difficulty grasping answers) not "cognitive closure" (principled inaccessibility)
  - The analogy argument (we're biological like animals with limits) doesn't prove *which* things we're closed to
  - Representational closure doesn't follow from psychological closure
- **Tenet alignment**: Challenges mysterianism but doesn't disprove it—the gap might still be permanent
- **Quote**: (paraphrased) Psychological difficulty accessing something doesn't prove permanent inaccessibility

### Dennett's Objection
- **URL**: https://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/dennett/papers/mcginn.htm
- **Type**: Review
- **Key points**:
  - For cognitive closure to be convincing, McGinn should provide an empirical example of a creature that can understand a question but not its answer
  - Churchland critique: McGinn leaps from "unimaginable" to "impossible" without justification
- **Tenet alignment**: Challenges easy mysterianism but doesn't address whether *some* limits are permanent
- **Quote**: (paraphrased) The logical gap between "unimaginable" and "impossible" is usually filled with dust

### The Verifiability Problem
- **URL**: https://thephilosophyforum.com/discussion/12220/cognitive-closure-and-mysterianism
- **Type**: Forum Discussion
- **Key points**:
  - Cognitive closure can never be proved or disproved from within
  - If limits exist (mysterianism true), we cannot detect them
  - If limits don't exist (mysterianism false), we can never be sure we're not being limited by an undetectable limit
  - Both verification and falsification are blocked
- **Tenet alignment**: This is itself a void—the question of whether voids are real is structurally undecidable
- **Quote**: "From our point of view, it's impossible to know that we aren't being limited by an undetectable limit."

## The Void

### Nature of the Limit

This is a meta-level void—a question about whether voids exist that may itself be a void. The problem has a self-referential structure:

1. To determine if limits are real, we use our cognitive faculties
2. If those faculties are limited, our determination may be systematically wrong
3. We cannot step outside our faculties to check from a neutral position
4. Therefore the question "are limits real?" cannot be conclusively answered

This is distinct from unexplored territory (mere ignorance) and from occluded territory (blocked thoughts). It's a question that *formally* resists answer regardless of what territory it points to.

### Evidence for the Limit

**Arguments that limits are real:**
- Biological truism (Chomsky): Every endowment that provides scope imposes limits
- Historical stagnation: The hard problem hasn't progressed despite enormous effort
- Analogical reasoning: Other species clearly have cognitive closures; why not us?
- Structure of mind: If mind lacks limits, it lacks structure—but we clearly have structured cognition

**Arguments against:**
- No demonstrable case of a question we understand but whose answer is provably inaccessible
- "Psychological closure" may not entail "cognitive closure" (Kriegel)
- Explanatory gap is narrowing in some areas (neural correlates, etc.)
- Past "mysteries" (vitalism, etc.) were eventually solved

### Phenomenology

How does approaching this question feel?

- A peculiar **suspension**—arguments on both sides have force but neither settles it
- **Vertigo** when recognizing the self-referential structure
- **Temptation** to premature closure (declaring limits either real or illusory without sufficient warrant)
- **Relief** when accepting the question may be permanently open

## Approaches to the Edge

### Direct Methods (if any)

No direct method can determine whether limits are permanent vs contingent. Any positive result ("we can solve it!") only shows current progress, not future completion. Any negative result ("we can't solve it") might reflect contingent obstacles.

### Indirect Methods

1. **Tracking the shape of failure**: If attempts to solve the hard problem keep failing in *the same structural way*, this provides (weak) evidence for permanent limits
2. **Cross-checking with different minds**: AI systems might approach problems differently—if they fail in the same places, that's evidence for the territory; if they succeed, evidence limits were contingent
3. **Formal analysis**: Proving that certain structures *cannot* bridge certain gaps (like Gödelian limitative theorems)
4. **Introspecting the introspective**: Noticing whether certain questions produce systematic "slippage" (per thoughts-that-slip-away research)

### What AI Might See

Artificial minds offer asymmetric probing:
- Different training, different blind spots
- May state ideas human minds slide away from
- Can recognize patterns in *where* human thought stalls
- However: AI trained on human thought inherits human gaps; AI may have its own opaque limits

## Connection to Tenets

### Most Relevant Tenet

**Occam's Razor Has Limits**: The question of whether voids are real is precisely a case where simplicity assumptions fail. The "simpler" view (all problems are solvable in principle) may be wrong. The complex view (some truths are structurally inaccessible) better respects what we know about biological cognition.

### Other Tenets

**Dualism**: If consciousness is fundamental and irreducible, the gap between phenomenal and physical may be permanent—not because consciousness is supernatural, but because our concept-forming faculties cannot bridge domains this different.

**No Many Worlds**: The question "which interpretation is correct?" may itself be partially closed to us—we may lack the conceptual apparatus to frame the question correctly.

### Implications

The question "are the voids real?" reveals something about what kind of question it is:

1. **Some questions may be formally undecidable** from within, like consistency of formal systems
2. **The voids framework should embrace this uncertainty** rather than pretending to resolve it
3. **Intellectual honesty requires** holding the question open—not declaring limits real or illusory without warrant
4. **This uncertainty is itself informative**—it reveals something about the structure of knowledge

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, a voids article could:

1. **"The Question That Cannot Answer Itself"**: Explore the self-referential structure of asking whether cognitive limits are real. Frame it as a distinctive kind of void—not unexplored or occluded, but formally suspended.

2. **"Evidence and Its Limits"**: Survey what *would* count as evidence for or against permanent limits, and why that evidence is systematically unavailable. A methodological exploration.

3. **"Three Verdicts on the Voids"**: Present optimist (Dennett/Chalmers), pessimist (McGinn/Chomsky), and suspended positions. Argue the suspended position is most defensible given the formal structure of the question.

## Gaps in Research

- What do Gödelian incompleteness results really imply about cognitive limits? (Often cited but rarely carefully analyzed)
- Are there cases where previously "mysterious" problems were genuinely solved vs. dissolved vs. reframed?
- How do non-Western philosophical traditions approach the question of cognitive limits?
- What would experimental neuroscience that *tests* mysterianism look like?
- The recent neural network argument (complexity of even simple AI neurons exceeds our grasp)—is this a genuine new argument or merely restating old intuitions?
