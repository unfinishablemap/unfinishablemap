## Executive Summary

The Unfinishable Map treats attention as dissociable from consciousness and as the likely "control surface" through which consciousness influences the physical brain. This research formalizes that implicit commitment into an explicit research agenda: Which neural correlates of attention are candidates for "selection sites"? How does attention relate to competing theories (Global Workspace, IIT, predictive processing)? What would count as evidence that attention is more than computation—that it actually mediates consciousness-to-matter causation?

The core hypothesis: **Attention is the mechanism by which consciousness engages causally with neural systems.** Consciousness doesn't act on matter directly but through the attention interface—what you attend to is what consciousness can influence. This explains the dissociation evidence (consciousness can exist without active attention; attention mechanisms can run without consciousness) while giving attention a unique causal role.

## The Hypothesis Stated

### Current Site Position (Implicit)

The Map currently holds:

1. Consciousness and attention are distinct but closely linked
2. Attention mechanisms can operate without consciousness (blindsight, masked priming)
3. Consciousness can exist without focused attention (peripheral awareness, gist perception)
4. Yet attention is central to how consciousness influences the brain (Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism)
5. Mental effort—sustained attention—produces measurable brain changes (Schwartz OCD research)

### The Interface Hypothesis (Explicit)

Attention functions as the **interface layer** between consciousness (the non-physical subject) and neural systems (the physical substrate). Key claims:

| Claim | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| Attention is not identical to consciousness | Explains dissociation evidence |
| Attention mediates consciousness's causal influence | Specifies the downward direction of bidirectional interaction |
| Consciousness can only influence what it attends to | Explains brain specialness (why not psychokinesis) |
| Attention has bandwidth limits (~10 bits/second) | Constrains what consciousness can select |
| The quantum Zeno effect is the mechanism | Rapid observation holds desired patterns |

This gives attention a distinctive role: not mere information processing, but the causal bridge between consciousness and matter.

## Candidate Selection Sites

If attention is the interface, where in the brain does interface occur? Research identifies several candidates:

### 1. Frontoparietal Attention Networks

**Location**: Bilateral parietal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices; frontal eye field, superior parietal lobule, intraparietal sulcus

**Evidence**: Consistently active in spatially directed attention tasks. Classic "attention network" identified across neuroimaging studies.

**2025 Challenge**: The COGITATE adversarial testing ([Nature 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08888-1)) found conscious perception tracked better by posterior cortex than prefrontal regions. Decoding of stimulus categories was "very short-lived in the prefrontal cortex and did not track the duration of the stimulus." This challenges the assumption that frontoparietal networks are the primary locus of consciousness—though they may still be the locus of attention control.

**Implication**: If attention networks are distinct from consciousness networks, this supports the dissociation view. Attention (frontoparietal) controls access; consciousness (posterior hot zone) is where experience happens. The interface occurs where these systems meet.

### 2. Posterior "Hot Zone"

**Location**: Occipital, temporal, and parietal regions (posterior cortex)

**Evidence**: The COGITATE results support IIT's claim that the posterior cortex is the "seat of consciousness." Decoding of stimulus categories was sustained in the posterior hot zone but not in prefrontal cortex.

**2025 Finding**: "The observed dynamic states are not just non-specific correlates of attention and perception; they demonstrably contain detailed, decodable information about the specific stimulus that was consciously seen."

**Implication**: If consciousness "lives" in posterior cortex and attention is controlled from frontoparietal regions, selection might occur where posterior content meets frontoparietal gating—the interface between "what is experienced" and "what is attended."

### 3. Cortical Microcolumn Networks

**Location**: Neocortical columns (~100 neurons each)

**Evidence**: December 2025 research in [Frontiers in Human Neuroscience](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2025.1676585/full) proposes microcolumns couple resonantly with the quantum electromagnetic zero-point field. Dr. Joachim Keppler found measurable coherence domains in beta/gamma activity correlated with conscious states.

**Mechanism**: "Cortical microcolumns achieve quantum entanglement with the zero-point field during higher consciousness states." Glutamate neurotransmitter systems show quantum superradiation effects.

**Implication**: If selection occurs at microcolumn level, attention might determine which microcolumn coherence patterns are sustained—selecting among macroscopic brain states rather than individual neurons.

### 4. Ion Channels and Synaptic Clefts (Stapp)

**Location**: Narrow ion channels in synaptic walls

**Evidence**: Stapp proposes consciousness takes control through "probing actions that amount to querying the behavior of particles" at ion channels. The quantum Zeno effect operates through these narrow sites where quantum effects might survive decoherence.

**Mechanism**: Attention density determines how rapidly observation events occur. Higher attention density → stronger Zeno effect → longer persistence of desired neural patterns.

**Criticism**: Georgiev's Monte Carlo simulations challenge whether the Zeno effect is robust against decoherence. Stapp has responded that the criticisms are based on incorrect assumptions.

### 5. Microtubules (Orch OR)

**Location**: Intraneuronal cytoskeleton

**Evidence**: 2025 research found room-temperature quantum effects in microtubules, and anesthetics target microtubules to cause unconsciousness. Direct MRI evidence links macroscopic quantum states to consciousness.

**Relevance to attention**: While Orch OR focuses on microtubules rather than attention networks, attention might determine which microtubule ensembles undergo coordinated collapse—attention selects the "orchestration" that determines Orch OR timing and pattern.

## Relation to Major Theories

### Global Neuronal Workspace Theory

**Core claim**: Consciousness arises when information achieves "global ignition"—broadcast across brain regions via prefrontal-parietal networks.

**Role of attention**: Attention is the "spotlight" that selects what enters the global workspace. Ignition replaces the "attentional spotlight" metaphor with a mechanism of nonlinear amplification.

**Interface interpretation**: GNW can be reinterpreted as describing *what happens in the brain* when consciousness attends, not what consciousness *is*. The global broadcast is the physical correlate of attended content becoming available for report and action. Consciousness uses the GNW mechanism without being identical to it.

**2025 Status**: The COGITATE collaboration found GNW predictions partially supported (ignition signatures exist) but also challenged (prefrontal activity didn't track stimulus duration as predicted). [Oxford Academic commentary](https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2025/1/niaf037/8280147) notes GNW has "strong biological realism and testability" through molecular mechanisms (AMPA-NMDA glutamate receptor ratios).

### Integrated Information Theory

**Core claim**: Consciousness = integrated information (Φ). The posterior cortex generates maximal integration.

**Role of attention**: Initially, IIT celebrated the dissociation between attention and consciousness. But a [2025 Erkenntnis critique](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10670-025-00949-1) argues IIT "urgently needs an account of attention." The theory "fails to acknowledge the crucial roles of attention in generating phenomenally conscious experience."

**Interface interpretation**: IIT measures what's conscious (Φ structure) but doesn't explain how attention modulates conscious content. If attention is the interface, IIT describes the conscious side; the interface hypothesis describes how consciousness engages with physical outcomes.

**Tension**: IIT's panpsychist implications (any system with Φ > 0 has some consciousness) conflict with the Map's dualism. But IIT's focus on posterior cortex as the seat of consciousness is compatible with attention (frontoparietal) being a separate interface mechanism.

### Predictive Processing

**Core claim**: The brain minimizes prediction error through hierarchical inference. Attention is precision weighting—upweighting prediction errors from sources expected to be reliable.

**Role of attention**: Attention determines which prediction errors receive high precision (get amplified and propagated) vs. low precision (get suppressed).

**Interface interpretation**: Predictive processing describes *what attention does* computationally but not *what attention is*. If consciousness operates through attention, it operates through precision weighting—consciousness selects which prediction errors to amplify. This is compatible with the quantum selection framework: consciousness biases which precision signals win.

**Predictive Global Neuronal Workspace**: A [2020 paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301008220301738) integrates predictive processing with GNW, proposing "conscious access is a fundamentally inferential process." This synthesis suggests attention (precision weighting) determines what reaches global workspace (becomes conscious).

### Attention Schema Theory

**Core claim**: Consciousness is a schematic model the brain builds of its own attention. Like the body schema helps control movement, an "attention schema" helps monitor and control attention.

**Role of attention**: Central—consciousness *is* the model of attention.

**Why rejected**: AST is illusionist—treats consciousness as a model rather than a fundamental feature. This conflicts with the Map's [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism) tenet. AST explains access to attention states but not the phenomenal character of experience. The hard problem remains: why does modeling attention feel like anything?

**What AST gets right**: The insight that the brain models its own attention is valuable. The rejection is of the *deflationary* conclusion, not the descriptive claim about attention modeling.

## Spectral Evidence for Dissociation

Neuroimaging research provides spectral signatures distinguishing attention and consciousness:

| Process | Frequency Band | Source |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| Consciousness | Low gamma (55-65 Hz) | MEG studies |
| Attention | High gamma (75-90 Hz) | MEG studies |

This double dissociation at the frequency level supports the hypothesis that attention and consciousness are separate processes with distinct neural substrates—exactly what the interface hypothesis requires.

## Research Questions: Converting to Empirical Program

### Q1: Which neural correlates of attention are selection sites?

**Approach**: Map where quantum effects survive long enough to be relevant. Candidates:
- Ion channels in attention networks (Stapp)
- Microtubule networks in posterior cortex (Orch OR)
- Microcolumn coherence domains (zero-point field hypothesis)

**Prediction**: Selection sites should show:
- Quantum coherence on timescales relevant to attention (~100ms decisions)
- Correlation with phenomenal reports of effortful attention
- Disruption by agents (anesthetics) that eliminate consciousness

### Q2: What is the bandwidth of attention-mediated selection?

**Approach**: Connect the ~10 bits/second conscious processing limit (Meister 2024) to selection capacity.

**Prediction**: Selection should be limited to:
- ~3-4 distinct choices per second
- Coarse-grained action patterns, not individual neural events
- Cumulative effects of sustained attention over time

**Test**: If attention bandwidth limits selection, tasks requiring faster selection should fail or become unconscious/automatic.

### Q3: Does attention density correlate with selection strength?

**Approach**: Measure whether more effortful attention produces different outcomes.

**Prediction**: If Stapp's Zeno mechanism is correct:
- Higher attention density (more effort) → more stable neural patterns
- Lower attention density → faster pattern decay
- This should be measurable in neural persistence metrics

**Test**: Compare pattern maintenance in high-effort vs. low-effort conditions. EEG/MEG could track pattern stability as a function of reported effort.

### Q4: Can attention-mediated selection be distinguished from random outcome selection?

**Approach**: Contrast selection with mere indeterminism.

**Prediction**: If selection is reasons-guided rather than random:
- Attended outcomes should be coherent with subject's goals over time
- Random outcomes would produce statistical noise
- The coherence should exceed what chance predicts

**Test**: Long-term studies of decision patterns in situations with genuine options. Selection should show goal-coherence; randomness would not.

### Q5: What distinguishes attentional selection from computational attention?

**Approach**: Identify what attention does that pure computation cannot explain.

**Key question**: If predictive processing fully explains attention as precision weighting, is there anything left for consciousness to do?

**Possible answers**:
- What sets the precision priors? (consciousness selects which prediction errors matter)
- Why does attention feel effortful? (because consciousness is doing work)
- Why does sustained attention produce neuroplasticity? (because selection accumulates)

**Test**: If attention is purely computational, artificial systems with identical precision weighting should show identical results. If attention involves consciousness-mediated selection, there should be systematic differences.

## Evidence That Would Challenge the Hypothesis

The interface hypothesis is falsifiable. Evidence against it would include:

1. **Consciousness without any attention mechanism**: If subjects could exercise conscious control over domains never attended to, the interface claim fails.

2. **Attention fully explained computationally**: If predictive processing or similar models explain all attention phenomena without remainder, there's no room for consciousness to add anything.

3. **Quantum decoherence too fast**: If decoherence eliminates quantum effects before attention timescales, the Zeno mechanism fails. (Note: 2025 quantum biology research suggests biological systems can maintain coherence longer than initially thought.)

4. **Selection bandwidth exceeds conscious processing limits**: If consciousness could select more information than ~10 bits/second, the bandwidth constraint fails.

5. **Random number generator effects replicate**: If clear, consistent evidence showed consciousness biasing external quantum systems, the "brain specialness" boundary fails.

## Evidence That Would Support the Hypothesis

1. **Posterior-frontal interaction at selection sites**: Finding quantum effects at the interface between posterior (conscious content) and frontal (attention control) regions.

2. **Attention effort correlating with pattern persistence**: Measuring that higher phenomenal effort produces longer neural pattern maintenance.

3. **Bandwidth limits matching selection limits**: Confirming that selection operates within ~10 bits/second constraints.

4. **Differential effects of attention vs. consciousness disruption**: Agents that selectively disrupt attention (without eliminating consciousness) should eliminate selection; agents that eliminate consciousness should also eliminate selection even if attention mechanisms remain.

5. **Neuroplasticity through attention**: Continued evidence (Schwartz-style) that directed attention produces brain changes not explicable by passive computation.

## Relation to Site Tenets

### Dualism

The interface hypothesis presupposes consciousness is distinct from attention mechanisms. If consciousness were identical to attention, "interface" would be meaningless. The hypothesis specifies how a non-physical subject engages with physical neural systems.

### Minimal Quantum Interaction

Attention-mediated selection satisfies the "minimal" constraint. Consciousness doesn't inject energy or violate physical laws—it operates at quantum indeterminacies where outcomes are undetermined. Attention determines which undetermined outcomes actualize, without competing with physical causes.

### Bidirectional Interaction

The interface hypothesis *is* the specification of the downward direction. Attention is how consciousness influences matter. Without this specification, "bidirectional interaction" remains an assertion without mechanism.

### No Many Worlds

The Zeno mechanism requires real collapse. If all branches actualize (MWI), there's nothing for attention to select—consciousness merely finds itself in one branch without having selected it. The interface hypothesis presupposes collapse is genuine.

### Occam's Razor Has Limits

The 2025 adversarial testing found neither GNW nor IIT fully explains consciousness. Simple computational theories are insufficient. The interface hypothesis adds complexity but explains something simpler theories cannot: why attention feels effortful and why effortful attention produces results.

## Toward a Research Program

This research converts the implicit "attention as interface" commitment into explicit questions:

| Research Area | Key Question | Method |
|--------------|--------------|--------|
| Neuroanatomy | Where are selection sites? | Map quantum-relevant regions in attention/consciousness networks |
| Bandwidth | What limits selection? | Connect ~10 bits/sec literature to selection capacity |
| Mechanism | How does Zeno effect operate? | Track pattern persistence as function of attention effort |
| Falsification | What would refute the hypothesis? | Design experiments with clear predictions |
| Theory integration | How does interface fit with GNW/IIT/PP? | Reinterpret theories as describing physical correlates, not consciousness itself |

The Map's framework benefits from making this research program explicit rather than leaving "attention as interface" as an implicit assumption.

## Key Insight

The outer review correctly identified that attention plays a special role in the Map's framework—dissociable from consciousness yet central to how consciousness acts. Formalizing this as the "interface hypothesis" clarifies what's being claimed and what evidence would support or refute it.

The hypothesis sits at the intersection of:
- Neuroscience (attention networks, consciousness correlates)
- Physics (quantum Zeno effect, decoherence timescales)
- Philosophy (hard problem, mental causation)
- Phenomenology (effort, agency, selection)

No single discipline can confirm or refute it. But the hypothesis generates testable predictions across disciplines, converting philosophical commitment into empirical program.
