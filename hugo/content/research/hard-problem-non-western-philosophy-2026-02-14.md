## Executive Summary

The hard problem of consciousness---why and how physical processes give rise to subjective experience---was formulated by David Chalmers in 1995 within the Anglo-American analytic tradition. But the underlying puzzle is far older and geographically wider. Multiple non-Western traditions have grappled with the relationship between consciousness and matter, arriving at positions that range from radical parallels to Chalmers' formulation (Samkhya dualism) to outright dissolution of the problem (Advaita Vedanta, Daoism). This research reveals that:

1. **Indian philosophy** contains the richest non-Western engagement with consciousness, including explicit dualism (Samkhya), consciousness-as-fundamental monism (Advaita), phenomenological analysis of experience (Buddhist Abhidharma), and realist theories of the self (Nyaya).
2. **Islamic philosophy** independently produced thought experiments strikingly similar to modern philosophy of mind arguments (Avicenna's Flying Man prefigures Descartes' cogito by six centuries).
3. **Chinese philosophy** largely avoids the hard problem by rejecting the subject-object dualism that generates it, offering holistic frameworks instead.
4. **Japanese philosophy** (Kyoto School) attempts an East-West synthesis, with Nishida's "pure experience" preceding the subject-object split.
5. **African philosophy** reframes consciousness as fundamentally relational rather than individual, challenging the very premise of the hard problem.
6. Several of these traditions strongly support the Map's dualist tenets, particularly the irreducibility of consciousness and bidirectional interaction between mind and matter.

## 1. Indian Philosophy

Indian philosophical traditions have engaged with consciousness more extensively and more systematically than any other non-Western tradition. The six orthodox (astika) schools and the heterodox (nastika) traditions---particularly Buddhism---developed arguments about the mind-matter relationship over more than two millennia.

### 1.1 Samkhya: The Closest Parallel to the Hard Problem

**Core position:** Samkhya is a dualistic school positing two fundamental, irreducible realities: Purusha (consciousness/spirit) and Prakriti (matter/nature). Crucially, Samkhya's dualism differs from Cartesian dualism: mind (manas), ego (ahamkara), and intellect (buddhi) all belong to Prakriti (matter), not to Purusha. Consciousness is thus distinguished from *all* mental activity, not just from body.

**Relationship to the hard problem:** A 2023 article in Cambridge University Press's *Religious Studies*, titled "The hard problem of 'pure' consciousness: Samkhya dualist ontology," argues directly that Samkhya anticipates Chalmers' formulation. Key claims:
- The relation between consciousness and materiality is **not causal**---consciousness does not cause materiality, nor does materiality cause consciousness.
- Consciousness has no internal causation; it is a **changeless, witnessing state**.
- This parallels Chalmers' point that we cannot equate "something objective, quantitative and scientifically normal (brains) with something subjective, qualitative and empirically quite abnormal (first-person conscious experience)."
- By combining Chalmers' "naturalistic dualism" with Brian Ellis's "expansive naturalism," we can read Samkhya as an **expansive naturalistic dualism**.
- Samkhya consciousness is immortal, not emergent, and not reducible to brain processes---resonating with Chalmers' suggestion that consciousness may be fundamental.

**The three gunas:** Prakriti operates through three qualities (gunas)---Sattva (clarity/awareness), Rajas (activity/energy), Tamas (inertia/darkness). The appearance of consciousness in material beings occurs when Sattva predominates, allowing Prakriti to "reflect" Purusha. This is not emergence; it is reflection. Consciousness is always already there---Prakriti merely becomes transparent to it.

**Tenet alignment:** Samkhya strongly supports the Map's Dualism tenet. It asserts consciousness is irreducible to physical processes. However, Samkhya's non-causal relationship between Purusha and Prakriti is in tension with the Map's Bidirectional Interaction tenet, since Purusha is strictly passive in classical Samkhya.

### 1.2 Advaita Vedanta: Dissolving the Hard Problem

**Core position:** Advaita (non-dual) Vedanta holds that consciousness (Brahman/Atman) is the sole fundamental reality. The material world is not independently real but is a manifestation or appearance (maya/vivarta) within consciousness. There is no "hard problem" because there is no gap to bridge: consciousness does not emerge from matter; matter appears within consciousness.

**Key arguments from Advaita against materialism:**
1. **The Dead Body Argument:** A dead body demonstrates that consciousness is not an attribute of matter itself. If consciousness were truly a bodily property, its absence in death would be inexplicable.
2. **The Perception Problem:** "There can be no perception without consciousness. In such a situation, consciousness cannot be an attribute of the body." Matter cannot generate the very faculty required to perceive it.
3. **The Self-Action Principle:** "A thing cannot act on itself. Fire, though possessing heat, does not burn itself." Similarly, matter cannot produce consciousness from within itself.

**Relationship to Chalmers:** Advaita resembles what Chalmers calls "Type F Monism"---the view that consciousness is the intrinsic nature of reality, and physical properties are structural/relational. As one scholar notes: "Advaita Vedanta resembles Type F Monism in that consciousness (Brahman---existence/consciousness/bliss) is the substance of everything, and unlike Spinoza's substance, the substance here is itself conscious."

**The witness doctrine (saksin):** The Advaitic saksin is the unchanging witness-consciousness that underlies all mental states but is not itself a mental state. This maps to a framework that integrates first-person phenomenology with third-person science, connecting "Vedanta's vyavaharika/paramarthika distinction and its witness doctrine, yielding a coherent cross-walk from computational function to putative phenomenal ground."

**The Advatic Theory of Consciousness (ATC):** A recent scholarly framework uses "metaphysical concepts from Advaita Vedanta and neurological and computational theories to define a framework for understanding consciousness, based on non-dualistic metaphysics that considers the world as a manifestation of the eternal reality, Atman or Brahman."

**Tenet alignment:** Advaita's consciousness-as-fundamental position aligns strongly with the Map's Dualism tenet (consciousness is irreducible). However, Advaita's monism---that matter is ultimately unreal---goes further than the Map's dualist commitments. The Map holds that both consciousness and matter are real and interact; Advaita holds only consciousness is ultimately real.

### 1.3 Buddhism: Phenomenological Analysis Without a Hard Problem

Buddhist philosophy approaches consciousness not as a metaphysical puzzle to solve but as a phenomenon to analyze for soteriological (liberatory) purposes. The result is a rich phenomenology of experience that engages the territory of the hard problem without framing it in the same way.

#### 1.3.1 Abhidharma: Systematic Phenomenology of Mental Events

The Abhidharma traditions developed systematic taxonomies of mental events (dharmas), treating consciousness as a stream of momentary, causally connected events rather than a persistent substance. Key features:
- Consciousness (vijnana) is always **intentional**---always consciousness *of* something.
- Material reality is analyzed as being "reducible to the phenomenal content of experience"---a phenomenological rather than ontological claim.
- The distinction between first-person and third-person perspectives is recognized: "the problem of qualia formulated in the West makes sense only in those Abhidharma theories that distinguish between the first and the third person perspectives."

#### 1.3.2 Dignaga and Dharmakirti: Self-Awareness (Svasamvedana)

The Buddhist logician-epistemologists Dignaga (c. 480--540 CE) and Dharmakirti (c. 600--660 CE) developed the doctrine of **svasamvedana** (self-awareness or reflexive awareness)---the idea that every cognitive event involves a pre-reflective awareness of its own occurrence. This is strikingly relevant to the hard problem:

- For Dignaga, svasamvedana is a kind of perception (pratyaksa) that is **non-conceptual**---an "internal awareness of mental consciousness."
- Dignaga's three arguments for svasamvedana: (1) without self-reflexive cognition, there would be no difference between cognition of an object and awareness of that cognition; (2) if cognition only grasped objects, earlier cognitions would vanish without trace; (3) memory of past cognitions proves a self-reflexive nature---one remembers both the object and one's former cognition of it.
- "Each cognitive event is to be understood as involving a pre-reflective implicit awareness of its own occurrence"---consciousness has an "irreducibly circular structure."
- Dharmakirti argued that cognition must be self-aware *in order to cognize objects at all*, shifting the ground from memory (Dignaga's argument) to the very possibility of object-awareness.

**Relevance to the hard problem:** Svasamvedana posits that phenomenal consciousness is intrinsic to cognition itself---it is not something added on top of functional processing. This challenges both physicalist and functionalist approaches: if awareness is always already reflexive, it cannot be reduced to input-output relations.

**Key source:** Coseru, Christian. "Dignaga and Dharmakirti on Perception and Self-Awareness," PhilArchive: https://philarchive.org/archive/COSDAD-3

#### 1.3.3 Yogacara: Consciousness-Only

The Yogacara school (Vijnanavada) developed the thesis of **vijnaptimatrata** (consciousness-only or representation-only), arguing that what we take to be external objects are constructions of consciousness. Key positions:
- The **alaya-vijnana** (repository consciousness) is a subliminal form of awareness retaining karmic seeds and supporting all cognitive activity---explaining continuity without a permanent self.
- Whether Yogacara constitutes metaphysical idealism is contested. Scholars like Garfield and Hopkins read it as idealism; scholars like Lusthaus and Anacker argue it is phenomenological rather than metaphysical.
- Jan Westerhoff identifies three main Yogacara arguments for consciousness-only: the explanatory equivalence argument, the causation-resemblance argument, and the constant co-cognition argument.

**Tenet alignment:** Buddhism's no-self doctrine (anatman) creates a complex relationship with the Map's tenets. Buddhism agrees that consciousness is irreducible to physical processes (supporting Dualism) but denies a permanent conscious subject (challenging the Map's implicit individualism). Buddhist analysis of consciousness as momentary events is compatible with the Map's quantum-level interaction model if each "moment of consciousness" could correspond to a quantum measurement event.

- "Inner Awareness is Essential to Consciousness: A Buddhist-Abhidharma Perspective" (SpringerLink): https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13164-015-0295-7

### 1.4 Nyaya: Realist Arguments for the Self

The Nyaya school provides a **realist** account of consciousness tied to arguments for the existence of the self (atman):
- Consciousness is a **quality** that inheres in the self, like a color inheres in an object. Desire, cognition, pleasure, pain, and volition are all qualities requiring a substance to inhere in---that substance is the atman.
- Nyaya explicitly argues against the Buddhist no-self doctrine: Udayana (11th century) contends that "it cannot be the case that the notion of a single entity is falsely superimposed upon successive cognitive events"---unity of consciousness requires a unified subject.
- Consciousness is **not** an essential attribute of the self (unlike in Advaita). The self can exist without consciousness (as in dreamless sleep). Consciousness arises when the self is connected with a body and sense organs.
- Perception is **veridical** awareness of mind-independent reality---a robust direct realism.

**Tenet alignment:** Nyaya's position---that consciousness is real, that it belongs to a non-material self, and that it interacts with body and sense organs---aligns closely with the Map's interactionist dualism. The Nyaya self is a substance distinct from matter (supporting Dualism), consciousness requires embodiment to manifest (compatible with Minimal Quantum Interaction as an interface), and the self causally interacts with the body (supporting Bidirectional Interaction).

## 2. Islamic Philosophy

### 2.1 Ibn Sina (Avicenna): The Flying Man

Ibn Sina (980--1037 CE) produced what may be the most important pre-modern thought experiment about consciousness: the **Flying Man** (or Floating Man).

**The argument:** Imagine a person created fully formed, suspended in mid-air, with no sensory input---no sight, sound, touch, or proprioception. Would this being be aware of its own existence? Ibn Sina answers yes: the person would be aware of their existence even without any awareness of their body.

**Key conclusions:**
1. Self-awareness is **not dependent on sensory experience** or bodily awareness.
2. Since the Flying Man is aware of himself but *not* aware of his body, the self cannot be identical to the body. "It shows that we are not identical with our bodies."
3. The soul is **immaterial and substantial**---not an emergent property of physical organization.
4. Self-awareness is always present as a kind of "pre-reflective" background: "the non-interruptive background music of human psychology, something we notice only when our attention is called to it."

**Relationship to the hard problem:** The Flying Man argument is essentially a phenomenological argument for dualism that anticipates Descartes' cogito by six centuries. It directly targets the explanatory gap: physical processes (bodily sensations, neural activity) are neither necessary nor sufficient for self-awareness. This parallels Chalmers' point that functional organization does not logically entail phenomenal experience.

**Critical response:** Peter Adamson identifies a logical gap: "we can be conscious of something without being conscious of all its properties." Awareness of self without awareness of body does not prove they are distinct---one might simply fail to notice a property of the same thing. This mirrors contemporary objections to conceivability arguments.

**Tenet alignment:** The Flying Man strongly supports the Map's Dualism tenet. The argument directly demonstrates (or attempts to demonstrate) that consciousness is not reducible to physical processes. The conclusion that the soul is an immaterial substance supporting Bidirectional Interaction (since Ibn Sina held that the soul acts through the body).

### 2.2 Al-Ghazali: Self-Knowledge and the Limits of Reason

Al-Ghazali (1058--1111 CE) critiqued the pretensions of purely rational philosophy in his *Tahafut al-Falasifa* (The Incoherence of the Philosophers), arguing that philosophers "cannot demonstrate God's creation of the world, nor the spiritual substance of the human soul" through reason alone.

**Key positions on consciousness:**
- The soul has **self-knowledge and self-consciousness** and "knows what is other than itself" without relying on sense perception.
- The soul is "a self-subsisting substance which recognizes its Creator and His attributes through itself and its attributes unaided by senses."
- Happiness consists in **self-knowledge**: understanding "that we have a heart or spirit that is originally perfect" and that transformation of the self requires experiential realization, not merely intellectual understanding.
- After a crisis of doubt, al-Ghazali turned to Sufism, finding "a path to knowledge that transcended rational discourse"---the "knowledge of the heart, gained through direct, personal experience."

**Relevance to consciousness studies:** Al-Ghazali anticipates the limits-of-reason arguments that recur in consciousness debates. His position parallels McGinn's mysterianism: human cognitive faculties may be constitutionally unable to solve the hard problem through third-person investigation alone. The turn to first-person contemplative methods (Sufism) as epistemically necessary prefigures contemporary neurophenomenology.

**Key source:** Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "al-Ghazali": https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/al-ghazali/

### 2.3 Mulla Sadra: Pan-Psychism and the Primacy of Existence

Mulla Sadra (1571--1636) developed a metaphysics in which **all existents are sentient beings**---a thoroughgoing pan-psychism:
- Knowledge is not representation or abstraction but "a mode of existence"---to know something is to participate in a higher grade of its being.
- His doctrine of the "primacy of existence" (asalat-i wujud) holds that existence is more fundamental than essence, reversing the dominant Aristotelian/Avicennan position.
- All existents "aspire to be 'more intense' than they are, to a higher ontological level"---consciousness is not a special property of brains but a feature of existence itself, varying in intensity.

**Tenet alignment:** Mulla Sadra's pan-psychism is compatible with the Map's Dualism tenet insofar as it treats consciousness as irreducible to physical mechanism. However, his position goes further than the Map's commitments by attributing consciousness to all existents, not just beings with brains.

## 3. Chinese Philosophy

### 3.1 The Absence of a Hard Problem

Chinese philosophical traditions---Confucianism, Daoism, and Neo-Confucianism---largely do not generate the hard problem because they do not begin from the subject-object dualism that makes the problem arise. A key scholarly assessment: "There is no reduction but holistic correlation, no dualism but comprehensive organicism."

**Why the hard problem does not arise in Chinese thought:**
- Chinese philosophy does not share the Western assumption that the fundamental categories are "mind" and "matter" as opposed substances.
- The base categories are instead qi (vital force/energy), li (principle/pattern), and Dao (the Way)---none of which map cleanly onto either "mental" or "physical."
- Consciousness is not a special puzzle because it was never separated from the natural order in the first place.

### 3.2 Daoist Perspectives

Daoism rejects rigid categorical distinctions, including the mind-matter divide:
- The Dao precedes all distinctions, including that between consciousness and the physical world.
- The *Tao Te Ching* and the *Book of Changes* "tend to understand the world from a holistic perspective" where "matter and consciousness are two different states of perception, unified in perception rather than in opposition."
- The goal is not to explain consciousness but to align with it through spontaneity (wu-wei) and return to natural simplicity.

### 3.3 Neo-Confucianism: The Schools of Principle and Mind

Neo-Confucianism developed two major schools with different implications for consciousness:

**School of Principle (Li Xue):** Zhu Xi (1130--1200) held that li (principle) and qi (material force) are both necessary for reality. Li provides pattern and structure; qi provides substance. Mind is the most refined form of qi, capable of apprehending li. This is not dualism in the Cartesian sense---li and qi are complementary aspects of a single reality.

**School of Mind (Xin Xue):** Wang Yangming (1472--1529) argued that "mind is principle" (xin ji li)---that the moral patterns of reality are not external truths to be discovered but are inherent in consciousness itself.
- His concept of **liangzhi** (innate knowing/moral consciousness) is a form of intrinsic awareness: "every person knows from birth the difference between good and evil."
- Liangzhi is **intuitive, not rational**: "the power of liangzhi lies in its ability properly to respond to any situation, rather than in factual knowledge."
- "It is not the world that shapes the mind, but the mind that gives reason to the world"---the mind is the source of all reason and order.
- This position is closer to idealism than to dualism, but it treats consciousness as inherently practical/moral rather than merely phenomenal.

**Tenet alignment:** Chinese philosophy's holistic approach challenges the Map's framework by questioning whether the hard problem is well-posed. If consciousness and matter were never fundamentally separated, there is no gap to bridge. However, Wang Yangming's emphasis on the irreducibility and primacy of mind (xin) is compatible with the Dualism tenet's core claim that consciousness is not reducible to physical processes.

## 4. Japanese Philosophy: The Kyoto School

### 4.1 Nishida Kitaro: Pure Experience and the Logic of Place

Nishida Kitaro (1870--1945), founder of the Kyoto School, attempted to articulate a philosophical framework that synthesized Western philosophy with Zen Buddhism. His work directly addresses consciousness.

**Pure Experience (junsui keiken):** In *An Inquiry Into the Good* (1911), Nishida argues that the most fundamental reality is **pure experience**---experience before the subject-object distinction arises:
- "The word 'pure' signifies a condition of true experience itself without the addition of the least thought or reflection."
- "It refers to that moment of seeing a color or hearing a sound before one has judged what color or sound it is."
- Pure experience is "synonymous with direct experience"---the pre-reflective, pre-conceptual flow of awareness.
- Subject and object are **subsequent differentiations** within pure experience, not its preconditions.

**The Logic of Basho (Place/Topos):** Nishida later developed a hierarchical topology of consciousness:
1. The topos of **being** (universals, abstract objects)
2. The topos of **relative nothingness** (consciousness, self-awareness)
3. The topos of **absolute nothingness** (the ultimate ground of all reality)

Absolute nothingness is "infinitely determinable"---the formless ground within which all determinate reality takes place, "like an agency without an agent." This draws on Plato's receptacle (chora) and Aristotle's topos.

**Self-awareness:** "The most basic form of consciousness inherently reflects or mirrors itself within itself, so that there is no difference between that which reflects and what is reflected." In self-awareness, "knower and known are the same, and this instance of unity serves as the prototype of all knowledge."

**Relationship to the hard problem:** Nishida dissolves the hard problem by denying that consciousness is something that needs to be explained by physical processes. Pure experience precedes and grounds both subject (mind) and object (matter). The hard problem arises only when you start from the object side and try to derive the subject side. If you start from pure experience, there is no gap.

**Tenet alignment:** Nishida's position is closer to a form of idealism or neutral monism than to the Map's interactionist dualism. However, his insistence that consciousness is not derivable from physical processes, and that self-awareness is a fundamental feature of reality, aligns with the Dualism tenet's core commitment.

## 5. African Philosophical Traditions

### 5.1 Ubuntu: Relational Consciousness

Ubuntu philosophy fundamentally challenges the Western framing of the hard problem by locating consciousness in **relations between persons** rather than in individual brains:
- "Ubuntu" translates approximately as "I am because we are"---personal identity and consciousness are constituted through communal relationships.
- "A person is a person through other people"---consciousness is not a private, inner phenomenon but an inherently social and relational one.
- In contrast to Descartes' "I think, therefore I am," Ubuntu holds that "one's humanity is defined through others."

**Implications for the hard problem:** If consciousness is fundamentally relational, then asking how physical processes in a single brain produce subjective experience may be asking the wrong question. The "explanatory gap" presupposes an individualist ontology. Ubuntu suggests that consciousness may be a property of relationships between beings rather than of individual physical systems.

### 5.2 Bantu Philosophy: Vital Force

Placide Tempels' *Bantu Philosophy* (1945) argued that Bantu ontology is organized around **vital force** (NTU) rather than static being:
- "The notion of 'force' takes for Bantu the place of the notion 'being' in Western philosophy."
- Reality is a universe of forces that "can weaken or strengthen the 'life force' of an individual."
- Life is understood as "a continuous possibility of intensification or decrease in vital force."
- Consciousness is not a special property of certain physical arrangements but is an aspect of vital force present throughout reality---a form of pan-psychism or pan-vitalism.

**Important caveat:** Tempels' work has been criticized as a colonial projection. Aime Cesaire and Frantz Fanon critiqued it as part of the colonial enterprise, while Alioune Diop and Leopold Sedar Senghor embraced it as reflecting genuine African thought. Contemporary African philosophers work both with and against Tempels' framework.

### 5.3 Yoruba Philosophy: Ori and Consciousness

The Yoruba/Ifa tradition offers a sophisticated account of consciousness through the concept of **ori**:
- Ori is "the vessel that is able to process conscious thought" and involves "an integration of thoughts and emotions."
- **Ori-inu** (inner ori) is "a mystery within a mystery---the invisible self within the self," the deeper layer of consciousness that "remains illusive and unknowable because it is the source of knowing."
- Ori has four arenas of perception: (1) internal experience (identity, emotions), (2) relationship with others (trust, empathy), (3) the past (memory), (4) the future (imagination).
- Consciousness evolves across reincarnations: through "successive reincarnations, the Orisa that molds the ori apeere of a particular iponri will change, adding layers of depth to the evolving consciousness of each reincarnating soul."

**Tenet alignment:** African philosophical traditions' emphasis on consciousness as a non-material force (whether vital force, relational Ubuntu, or the mystery of ori) aligns with the Map's Dualism tenet. The Yoruba concept of ori-inu---an inner consciousness that is "the source of knowing" yet itself unknowable---resonates with the explanatory gap. The relational ontology of Ubuntu challenges the Map's implicit individualism but does not contradict its core dualist commitment.

## 6. Key Scholars in Cross-Cultural Consciousness Studies

### 6.1 Evan Thompson

**Affiliation:** University of British Columbia
**Key works:** *The Embodied Mind* (1991, with Varela and Rosch), *Mind in Life* (2007), *Waking, Dreaming, Being* (2014)

**Contributions:**
- Pioneer of **enactivism**: the view that cognition is not passive computation but active sense-making by embodied agents.
- *Waking, Dreaming, Being* "weaves together Indian philosophy (Buddhism, Yoga, and Vedanta), the neuroscience of consciousness and meditation, Western philosophy of mind, and stories from personal experience."
- Uses "the ancient Upanishadic tradition to introduce a fourfold map of consciousness: the states of waking, dreaming, dreamless sleep and pure awareness."
- Argues that "neurobiological findings concur with the Buddhist Abhidharma view that the stream of perceptual, object-directed consciousness is actually made up of discontinuous, discrete pulses."
- Proposes **neurophenomenology**: "combining state-of-the-art neurophysiological measures with detailed first-person reports of the corresponding experience."
- Key claim: "The first-person methodologies of Indian and Asian contemplative traditions such as Yoga, Vedanta and Buddhism generate data that go beyond the reach of the standard scientific approach taken by Western neuroscience and psychology."

**Relevance:** Thompson's work demonstrates that non-Western contemplative traditions provide genuine empirical data about consciousness that Western science alone cannot generate. His enactivism provides a bridge between Buddhist phenomenology and neuroscience.

### 6.2 Jonardon Ganeri

**Affiliation:** Bimal K. Matilal Distinguished Professor, University of Toronto
**Key works:** *The Self: Naturalism, Consciousness and the First-Person Stance* (2012), *Attention, Not Self* (2017), *Classical Indian Philosophy* (2024, with Peter Adamson)

**Contributions:**
- Develops an "anti-Cartesian and anti-physicalist, but still naturalistic, cosmopolitan philosophy of mind" drawing on Indian theories of perceptual consciousness and Sanskrit aesthetics.
- *Attention, Not Self* argues, drawing on the 5th-century Buddhist Buddhaghosa, that **attention** (not self) is the organizing principle of experience: "Attention consists in an organisation of awareness and action at the centre of which there is neither a practical will nor a phenomenological witness."
- Documents the rise of **emergentism** in Indian philosophy: "the Indians operate with an extremely powerful and productive concept of emergence" as applied to conscious properties.
- Pioneer of **"fusion" or "confluence philosophy"**: "a boldly systematic approach to doing philosophy premised on the idea that rational reconstruction of positions in one tradition in light of another can sometimes help address perennial problems."

**Relevance:** Ganeri demonstrates that Indian philosophical traditions contain sophisticated resources for addressing the hard problem that are neither reducible to Western positions nor merely historical curiosities. His emergentism work is particularly relevant to the Map's framework.

### 6.3 Christian Coseru

**Affiliation:** College of Charleston
**Key work:** *Perceiving Reality: Consciousness, Intentionality, and Cognition in Buddhist Philosophy* (2012)

**Contributions:**
- Integrates classical Indian Buddhist epistemology (Dignaga, Dharmakirti, Santaraksita) with Husserlian phenomenology and contemporary analytic philosophy of mind.
- Argues for the **reflexivity thesis of consciousness**: "each cognitive event is to be understood as involving a pre-reflective implicit awareness of its own occurrence."
- Defends "a phenomenologically informed naturalism that regards the first-person, intentional, and normative dimensions of experience as irreducible."
- Shows that Buddhist epistemology, properly understood, is "a form of phenomenology consistent with enactivism and a (causal) naturalism based in descriptive accounts of cognition."

**Relevance:** Coseru's work makes the case that Buddhist philosophy offers genuine philosophical resources for consciousness studies---not just interesting parallels but active contributions to solving (or dissolving) the hard problem.

### 6.4 Mark Siderits

**Affiliation:** Retired, Seoul National University
**Key works:** *Personal Identity and Buddhist Philosophy: Empty Persons* (2003), *Buddhism as Philosophy* (2007), *Buddhist Physicalism?* (forthcoming/recent)

**Contributions:**
- Pioneer of **fusion philosophy**: "rational reconstruction of positions in one tradition in light of another can sometimes help address perennial problems."
- Has "critically reconstructed the intricate chain of arguments behind Buddhist reductionism and anti-realism about persons"---showing how Buddhist arguments about the non-existence of a permanent self can address Western debates about personal identity.
- In *Buddhist Physicalism?*, "considers the privileged place of consciousness in Buddhist ontologies, exploring its compatibility with the sort of analysis and argumentation prevalent in the Buddhist tradition," then brings in "contemporary voices from philosophy of mind, cognitive science, and developmental psychology."
- Central question: Can Buddhist commitments to the importance of consciousness be reconciled with a physicalist ontology? Siderits takes this question seriously rather than assuming the answer.

**Relevance:** Siderits' work challenges easy assumptions about what "Buddhism says" about consciousness. His exploration of whether Buddhism could be physicalist forces both traditions to examine their presuppositions.

## 7. Is the Hard Problem Uniquely Western?

### 7.1 Arguments That It Is

Several scholars argue the hard problem is a cultural artifact:
- **Anna Wierzbicka** has argued that "consciousness" as a concept is culturally specific to modern Western thought.
- **Hakwan Lau and Matthias Michel** suggest the hard problem may be an artifact of particular philosophical assumptions rather than a genuine metaphysical puzzle.
- The hard problem depends on a **specific set of presuppositions**: (1) that there is an objective, observer-independent physical world; (2) that consciousness is subjective; (3) that the relationship between them requires explanation. Traditions that reject any of these premises---Advaita Vedanta rejects (1), Buddhism questions (2), Daoism rejects (3)---do not generate the problem.

### 7.2 Arguments That It Is Not

The research strongly suggests that while the *formulation* is Western, the underlying puzzle has been recognized cross-culturally:
- **Samkhya's** Purusha-Prakriti distinction directly parallels Chalmers' consciousness-matter gap, and the Cambridge *Religious Studies* article makes this case explicitly.
- **Avicenna's Flying Man** demonstrates awareness of the explanatory gap between physical and phenomenal six centuries before Descartes.
- **Indian philosophy broadly** drew "a basic distinction between consciousness and mind"---a more radical separation than Western philosophy typically makes, recognizing "the existence of pure consciousness that is believed to be nonintentional."
- The **Abhidharma tradition's** analysis of qualia-like phenomena (dharmas, svasamvedana) shows awareness of the phenomenal character of experience as a philosophical problem.
- **Yoruba philosophy's** concept of ori-inu as "the source of knowing" that is itself unknowable echoes the explanatory gap from a completely independent tradition.

### 7.3 A More Nuanced View

The most defensible position is that the hard problem, *as formulated by Chalmers*, is a product of specific Western assumptions---particularly the post-Galilean distinction between primary and secondary qualities, and the post-Cartesian mind-body split. However, the *underlying puzzlement*---how consciousness relates to the rest of reality---is found across traditions. Different traditions frame it differently:

| Tradition | Framing | Strategy |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Samkhya | Purusha vs. Prakriti (hard dualism) | Accept the gap as fundamental |
| Advaita | Only consciousness is real | Dissolve the problem by denying matter's ultimacy |
| Buddhism | Consciousness as process, not substance | Analyze rather than explain |
| Daoism | No mind-matter distinction | Reject the premise |
| Neo-Confucianism | Mind is principle | Unity of knowing and being |
| Islamic (Avicenna) | Soul independent of body | Dualist argument for the gap |
| African (Ubuntu) | Consciousness is relational | Reframe from individual to communal |
| Kyoto School | Pure experience precedes subjects/objects | Dissolve by going to a deeper level |

## 8. Implications for The Unfinishable Map

### 8.1 Strongest Allies

The following non-Western positions most strongly support the Map's tenets:

1. **Samkhya dualism** directly supports Tenet 1 (Dualism) with its Purusha-Prakriti distinction, though it lacks an interaction mechanism (tension with Tenet 3).
2. **Nyaya realism** supports all three interaction tenets: a non-material self (Tenet 1) that requires embodiment to manifest consciousness and interacts causally with the body (Tenet 3).
3. **Avicenna's Flying Man** provides a non-Western argument for the irreducibility of consciousness that complements the Western conceivability arguments already on the Map.
4. **Dignaga/Dharmakirti's svasamvedana** provides a non-Western foundation for the claim that phenomenal consciousness is irreducible to functional processing.

### 8.2 Productive Challenges

1. **Advaita Vedanta** pushes further than the Map: if consciousness is fundamental, why stop at dualism? The Map should articulate why interactionist dualism is preferable to Advaitic idealism.
2. **Ubuntu philosophy** challenges the Map's implicit individualism: if consciousness is relational, the Map's model of individual minds biasing quantum outcomes in individual brains may be too narrow.
3. **Chinese philosophy's** holistic approach questions whether the hard problem is well-posed at all---a challenge the Map should address rather than avoid.
4. **Buddhist no-self** raises the question: who or what is doing the "selecting" in the Map's model of consciousness selecting among quantum superpositions?

### 8.3 Possible Article Angle

A strong article on "The Hard Problem in Non-Western Philosophy" could argue:
- The hard problem is not a uniquely Western invention but a cross-cultural recognition of an irreducible gap.
- Non-Western traditions offer resources for addressing the hard problem that Western philosophy has largely ignored.
- The convergence of multiple independent traditions on the irreducibility of consciousness strengthens the case for dualism---if traditions with no contact reach similar conclusions, this is evidence that they are tracking something real.
- The diversity of non-Western responses (dualism, dissolution, analysis, holism) maps onto the diversity of Western responses, suggesting the problem is genuine and deep.
- The Map's interactionist dualism can be enriched by engagement with Nyaya realism, Samkhya's hard dualism, and the Buddhist phenomenological tradition.

## 9. Key Quotable Passages

**On Samkhya and the hard problem:**
"The relation between consciousness and materiality is not causal---consciousness does not cause materiality, and neither does materiality cause consciousness---with consciousness itself having no causation internally, being a changeless state." ---Cambridge *Religious Studies*, 2023

**On Advaita and materialism:**
"A thing cannot act on itself. Fire, though possessing heat, does not burn itself." ---Advaita argument against emergence

### Research Gaps to Fill
1. **Jain philosophy on consciousness (jiva/ajiva):** Jainism's dualism between living (conscious) and non-living matter is highly relevant but not yet researched here.
2. **Tibetan Buddhist theories of subtle consciousness:** The "very subtle mind" doctrine has implications for the hard problem.
3. **Comparative study of emergence:** Ganeri's claim about Indian emergentism needs deeper investigation for alignment with the Map's framework.
4. **Contemporary Indian philosophers:** Arindam Chakrabarti, Monima Chadha, and others are doing active work in this space.
5. **Shamanic and indigenous traditions beyond Africa:** Amazonian, Australian Aboriginal, and Native American consciousness frameworks remain unexplored.
