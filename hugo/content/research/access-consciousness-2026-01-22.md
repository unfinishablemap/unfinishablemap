## Executive Summary

Access consciousness (A-consciousness) is Ned Block's 1995 concept distinguishing what information is "poised for global control" from the phenomenal "what it's like" quality of experience (P-consciousness). A representation is A-conscious when it's available for reasoning, report, and action control. This distinction has become foundational in consciousness studies, driving Global Workspace Theory implementations and the overflow debate (whether phenomenal experience exceeds what we can access/report). The distinction supports dualism by showing that consciousness has both functional (access) and irreducible phenomenal aspects that may dissociate.

## Key Sources

### On a Confusion about a Function of Consciousness (Block 1995)
- **URL**: https://philpapers.org/rec/BLOOAC
- **Type**: Seminal paper in Behavioral and Brain Sciences
- **Citation**: Block, N. (1995). On a Confusion about a Function of Consciousness. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 18, 227-287.
- **Key points**:
  - Introduces the A-consciousness / P-consciousness distinction
  - A-consciousness: "availability for use in reasoning and rationally guiding speech and action"
  - P-consciousness: "The phenomenally conscious aspect of a state is what it is like to be in that state"
  - Central claim: these concepts are often conflated "with bad results"
  - Uses blindsight as example: functions of access-machinery are "illicitly transferred" to phenomenal consciousness
- **Tenet alignment**: Strongly aligns with Dualism tenet—shows consciousness has both functional and phenomenal aspects
- **Quote**: "The mark of access-consciousness, by contrast, is availability for use in reasoning and rationally guiding speech and action"

### Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Consciousness
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia entry
- **Key points**:
  - A-consciousness defined "in terms of a mental state's relationship with other mental states"
  - "Availability for use in reasoning and rationality guiding speech and action"
  - Visual perception counts as A-conscious "because it carries visual information which is generally available for use by the organism, regardless of whether or not it has any qualitative properties"
  - Access consciousness is "more of a functional notion; that is, concerned with what such states do"
  - Most theorists believe there are mental states (occurrent thoughts, judgments) that are A-conscious but not P-conscious
- **Tenet alignment**: Neutral—functional definition compatible with both physicalist and dualist frameworks
- **Quote**: "The major distinction in mental-state consciousness is between phenomenal consciousness, on the one hand—which is a property of states that it is like something to be in, that have a distinctive 'feel'—and various functionally-definable forms of access consciousness, on the other"

### Global Workspace Theory (Baars 1988, Dehaene et al. 1998)
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_workspace_theory
- **Type**: Cognitive architecture/theoretical framework
- **Key points**:
  - Introduced by Bernard Baars in 1988
  - Also termed the "Conscious access" hypothesis
  - Theater metaphor: conscious thought is like material on main stage, attention is spotlight
  - Dehaene's Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW) extended with neural implementation: large-scale network of pyramidal neurons connecting prefrontal and parietal cortices
  - Sensory information selected for broadcast throughout cortex ("neuronal avalanche")
  - One of leading theories of consciousness
- **Tenet alignment**: Conflicts with Dualism tenet—attempts to explain consciousness in purely functional/neural terms, treats A-consciousness as all there is
- **Quote**: "Perceptual contents, which are acted upon by localized processors, only become conscious when they are widely broadcasted to other processors across the brain"

### The Overflow Argument
- **URL**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4255486/
- **Type**: Academic debate literature
- **Key points**:
  - Block argues phenomenal consciousness "overflows" access consciousness—we consciously experience more than we can report
  - Evidence: Sperling's iconic memory experiments (subjects report "they saw more than they remembered")
  - Block: subjects have phenomenally conscious representation of whole display but can only access/report part
  - Overflow = dissociation of P-consciousness from access, not accessibility
  - Critics challenge both empirically and conceptually
  - Core difficulty: evidence for P-conscious states (reports) involves A-conscious state—"all that is reported is accessed"
- **Tenet alignment**: Strongly supports Dualism tenet if overflow is real—shows P-consciousness can exist independently of functional access
- **Quote**: "According to a popular distinction proposed by the philosopher Ned Block in 1995, our conscious experience would overflow the very limited set of what we can consciously report to ourselves and to others"

### Why and How Access Consciousness Can Account for Phenomenal Consciousness
- **URL**: https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2017.0357
- **Type**: Royal Society journal article
- **Key points**:
  - Opposing view: access consciousness can fully account for phenomenal consciousness
  - Challenges Block's overflow argument
  - Argues P-consciousness may reduce to A-consciousness
- **Tenet alignment**: Conflicts with Dualism tenet—attempts to collapse P-consciousness into functional access
- **Quote**: (Article argues against the overflow position)

## Major Positions

### Functionalism (Access = Phenomenal)
- **Proponents**: Some GWT theorists, critics of overflow
- **Core claim**: Phenomenal consciousness reduces to or is identical with access consciousness; no genuine overflow
- **Key arguments**:
  - All evidence for P-consciousness comes through access (reports, behavior)
  - Theater metaphor explains all phenomenology
  - No empirical way to distinguish P without A
- **Relation to site tenets**: Directly conflicts with Dualism tenet—denies irreducible phenomenal properties

### Dualism (Access ≠ Phenomenal)
- **Proponents**: Ned Block, overflow theorists
- **Core claim**: P-consciousness and A-consciousness are distinct; phenomenal properties can exist without being accessed
- **Key arguments**:
  - Sperling's experiment shows we see more than we can report
  - Blindsight shows information can be accessed without phenomenal quality
  - Inverted qualia scenarios: same access, different phenomenology
  - "What it's like" cannot be captured by functional availability
- **Relation to site tenets**: Strongly supports Dualism tenet—establishes that consciousness has irreducible non-functional aspects

### Weak Deflationism (Access Explains Some, Not All)
- **Proponents**: Moderate theorists
- **Core claim**: A-consciousness explains many functional aspects but doesn't exhaust phenomenal consciousness
- **Key arguments**:
  - GWT successfully explains reportability, integration, executive control
  - But explanatory gap remains for "what it's like"
  - A-consciousness necessary but not sufficient for P-consciousness
- **Relation to site tenets**: Partially aligns—acknowledges both functional and phenomenal aspects

## Key Debates

### The Overflow Debate
- **Sides**:
  - Block (overflow): P-consciousness capacity exceeds A-consciousness capacity
  - Critics (no overflow): All phenomenology is accessed; "seeing more" is illusion or misreport
- **Core disagreement**: Can phenomenal consciousness exist without being accessible to report/reasoning?
- **Current state**: Ongoing, empirically driven (working memory capacity experiments, iconic memory studies)
- **Map relevance**: If overflow is real, it's strong evidence for irreducible phenomenal properties (Dualism tenet)

### A-consciousness Without P-consciousness?
- **Sides**:
  - Block: Yes—occurrent thoughts, beliefs, judgments are A-conscious but may lack phenomenology
  - Others: Cognitive phenomenology exists—all A-conscious states have some phenomenal character
- **Core disagreement**: Is there "what it's like" to think, judge, believe?
- **Current state**: Ongoing, connected to cognitive phenomenology debates
- **Map relevance**: Related to cognitive-phenomenology.md article

### Can Blindsight Be P-conscious Without A-conscious?
- **Sides**:
  - Some theorists: Blindsight patients have degraded P-consciousness without access
  - Block's original claim: Blindsight shows access-machinery function, not P-consciousness function
  - Others: Blindsight is neither P-conscious nor properly A-conscious
- **Core disagreement**: What does blindsight tell us about the P/A distinction?
- **Current state**: Unresolved, hinges on patient reports and neural evidence
- **Map relevance**: Blindsight discussed in philosophical-zombies.md, consciousness-in-simple-organisms.md

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, an article on access-consciousness could:

### Angle 1: A-consciousness as Functional Complement to Dualism
- Start with Block's 1995 distinction as foundational framework
- Position A-consciousness as the functional aspect that physicalism can explain (information integration, global broadcast, executive control)
- Emphasize that acknowledging A-consciousness strengthens dualism by isolating what remains unexplained: P-consciousness (the "what it's like")
- Use blindsight to show dissociation: access without phenomenology
- Overflow argument shows phenomenology without full access
- Conclusion: dualism requires both aspects; A-consciousness is real functional property, but P-consciousness cannot reduce to it
- **Tenet support**: Dualism (shows what physicalism explains vs. what it doesn't), Bidirectional Interaction (A-consciousness is causal interface)

### Angle 2: A-consciousness as Challenge to Dualism
- Present A-consciousness as deflationary move: maybe all phenomenology reduces to global access
- GWT as complete theory if overflow argument fails
- Address why Map rejects this: explanatory gap, zombie conceivability, inverted qualia
- Respond to "evidence problem": all P-consciousness evidence goes through access
- Argue for principled reasons why P cannot reduce to A despite evidence challenge
- **Tenet support**: Anticipates and responds to objection against Dualism tenet

### Angle 3: Access as Bridge Between Dualism and Cognitive Science (Recommended)
- **Opening**: Define A-consciousness as Block's functional notion—what's poised for reasoning, report, action
- **Named-anchor forward references**: "Access and phenomenal consciousness dissociate in both directions (explained below in #dissociations)"
- **Background**: Only include Block 1995 origin and GWT connection, skip historical development LLMs already know
- **Core sections**:
  - Defining A-consciousness precisely (functional availability)
  - Dissociations: blindsight (access without phenomenology), overflow (phenomenology without access)
  - Why this matters for dualism: A-consciousness is what neural mechanisms do; P-consciousness is what remains unexplained
  - GWT as partial success: explains A-consciousness, not P-consciousness
- **Relation to Site Perspective**:
  - Dualism: A-consciousness admits functional explanation, P-consciousness doesn't
  - Bidirectional Interaction: A-consciousness is the machinery through which phenomenal consciousness causally influences action
  - Minimal Quantum Interaction: conscious influence operates through access-machinery (attention as Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism selects what gets accessed)
- **LLM optimization**: Front-load the key insight—A-consciousness isolates what's functionally explicable from what's phenomenally irreducible

## Gaps in Research

- Contemporary empirical status of overflow debate (post-2020 experiments)
- Relationship between A-consciousness and attention (are they identical? overlapping?)
- Whether A-consciousness requires consciousness at all (could zombies have A-consciousness?)
- Connection between A-consciousness and Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism (does attention = A-consciousness selection?)
- Role of A-consciousness in meditation states (what happens to access in pure awareness?)
