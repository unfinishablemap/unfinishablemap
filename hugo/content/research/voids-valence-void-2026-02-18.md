## Executive Summary

The valence void names the impossibility of explaining *from within consciousness* why experience has a positive-negative dimension at all. The hard problem of consciousness asks why there is something it is like to be a physical system; the valence void asks a sharper question: why does that "something" come with a built-in good/bad polarity? Every conscious experience carries hedonic tone—pleasant, unpleasant, or nominally neutral—and this felt goodness or badness resists explanation in either physical or phenomenological terms. Physical descriptions explain the *function* of valence (approach/avoid signalling) without explaining why it *feels* a certain way. Introspection reveals valence as primitive and irreducible—pain hurts, and no further phenomenological decomposition makes the hurting less mysterious. The void is structural: consciousness cannot explain its own most fundamental evaluative dimension because that dimension is the lens through which all explanation occurs.

## Key Sources

### Peter Carruthers — "Valence and Value" (2018)
- **URL**: https://faculty.philosophy.umd.edu/pcarruthers/Valence%20and%20Value.pdf
- **Type**: Journal article (Philosophy and Phenomenological Research)
- **Key points**:
  - Valence is a central component of all affective states—pains, pleasures, emotions, moods, desires—forming a unitary natural-psychological kind
  - Two competing accounts: the *hedonic account* (valence is an intrinsic qualitative property that is inherently good or bad) versus the *representational account* (valence is a nonconceptual representation of value)
  - On the hedonic account, the badness of pain is intrinsic and non-relational—it just *is* bad, irreducibly
  - On the representational account, valence represents something as good or bad, but this pushes the explanatory question back: what makes the representation *feel* evaluative?
- **Tenet alignment**: Both accounts leave an explanatory residue compatible with dualism—either valence is an irreducible qualitative property (supporting non-physical qualia) or it represents value in a way that no physical description captures
- **Quote**: "Valence is a central component of all affective states... seemingly plays a fundamental role in motivating all kinds of intentional action."

### Walter Veit — "Hedonic Valence at the Core of Consciousness" (2024)
- **URL**: https://philosophymindscience.org/index.php/phimisci/article/view/11472
- **Type**: Journal article (Philosophy and the Mind Sciences)
- **Key points**:
  - Proposes hedonic valence as the most fundamental form consciousness can assume
  - Adopts a reverse-engineering approach: evaluative experience may be consciousness's evolutionary origin point
  - If hedonic valence is the core, then consciousness without valence ("de-cored consciousness") raises questions about whether it is consciousness at all
  - This suggests valence is not a contingent feature added to consciousness but constitutive of it
- **Tenet alignment**: Strongly relevant to dualism—if valence is constitutive of consciousness, then explaining consciousness requires explaining valence, and both resist physical reduction
- **Quote**: "Hedonic valence has received remarkably little attention in the field of consciousness studies... yet it is rather intuitive to think of a vague sense of either something negative or something positive as one of the most primary instances of experience."

### Michael Edward Johnson — "Principia Qualia" and the Symmetry Theory of Valence (2016)
- **URL**: https://opentheory.net/PrincipiaQualia.pdf
- **Type**: Book / research framework (Qualia Research Institute)
- **Key points**:
  - The Symmetry Theory of Valence (STV) proposes that the valence of a conscious experience corresponds to the symmetry of its information geometry
  - "Valence Realism" holds that valence exists as a crisp, measurable phenomenon of conscious states
  - "Qualia Formalism" holds that for any conscious experience, a mathematical object isomorphic to its phenomenology exists in principle
  - If STV is correct, it is an identity relation—symmetry *is* valence, not merely correlated with it
- **Tenet alignment**: STV attempts to bridge the explanatory gap with mathematical structure, but even if successful, the question of *why* symmetric information geometries feel good remains a void. The framework assumes qualia realism, compatible with the Map's dualist commitments
- **Quote**: "The symmetry of an information geometry of mind corresponds with how pleasant it is to be that experience."

### Jaak Panksepp — Affective Neuroscience (1998, ongoing influence)
- **URL**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6344464/
- **Type**: Research paradigm (selected principles review, Frontiers in Neuroscience, 2018)
- **Key points**:
  - Seven primary-process emotional command systems identified in subcortical regions: SEEKING, RAGE, FEAR, LUST, CARE, PANIC, PLAY
  - Each carries intrinsic valence—positive (approach) or negative (avoid)—as a fundamental property
  - These systems are subcortical and evolutionarily ancient, homologous across all mammals
  - Emotional feelings are "intrinsic values that inform animals how they are faring in the quest to survive"
  - Valence exists at the most primitive level of brain organization, not as a cortical overlay
- **Tenet alignment**: Panksepp's work shows valence is primordial, not derived—consistent with the view that evaluative experience is fundamental rather than emergent. The subcortical location suggests valence precedes higher cognition, deepening the explanatory challenge
- **Quote**: "Emotional feelings (affects) are intrinsic values that inform animals how they are faring in the quest to survive."

### Thomas Metzinger — Minimal Phenomenal Experience and Suffering (2020)
- **URL**: https://www.philosophie.fb05.uni-mainz.de/files/2020/03/Metzinger_MPE1_PMS_2020.pdf
- **Type**: Discussion paper / research programme
- **Key points**:
  - Develops concept of "minimal phenomenal experience" (MPE)—the simplest form consciousness can take
  - A system suffers when negatively valenced states are integrated into its phenomenal self-model
  - Suffering requires "phenomenally transparent, negatively valenced self-model moments"
  - The question of whether MPE itself has valence—whether the simplest consciousness is already hedonic—remains open
- **Tenet alignment**: If the minimal unit of consciousness already carries valence, this supports the view that valence is not separable from consciousness—deepening the void, since explaining consciousness and explaining valence collapse into the same unsolvable problem

### Buddhist Concept of Vedanā (Feeling-Tone)
- **URL**: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14639947.2018.1450966
- **Type**: Scholarly analysis (Contemporary Buddhism journal)
- **Key points**:
  - Vedanā is the hedonic tone that accompanies all conscious contact with sense objects—pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral
  - In Buddhist phenomenology, vedanā arises automatically and pre-reflectively at every moment of contact between sense organ, object, and consciousness
  - A large portion of vedanā is observable only through behavioural effects rather than being directly perceivable in immediate experience—known more by reactive states than by introspection
  - Vedanā is the point in the chain of dependent origination (paṭicca samuppāda) where craving (taṇhā) arises—the hinge between bare experience and suffering
  - The contemplative project of observing vedanā without reacting to it reveals the difficulty of accessing valence directly
- **Tenet alignment**: Buddhist analysis reveals a double void—vedanā is both constitutive of experience and partially opaque to introspection. Occam's Razor Has Limits applies: the apparent simplicity of "it feels good/bad" conceals a structure that resists both third-person and first-person analysis

### The "Vulcan" Thought Experiment
- **URL**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11614978/
- **Type**: Journal article (Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, 2024)
- **Key points**:
  - A "Vulcan" is a hypothetical conscious creature experiencing no positive or negative affective states
  - Some philosophers argue cognitive sophistication necessarily involves valenced experience—effort, curiosity, processing fluency all carry hedonic tone
  - If Vulcans are impossible—if consciousness without valence is incoherent—then valence is not an optional feature but a necessary condition
  - If Vulcans are possible, then valence is a contingent addition to consciousness, and its presence in our experience demands separate explanation
- **Tenet alignment**: Both horns of the dilemma point toward a void. Necessary valence makes the hard problem harder (you must explain consciousness *and* its evaluative dimension simultaneously). Contingent valence makes it mysterious why our consciousness has this feature at all

## The Void

### Nature of the Limit

The valence void is primarily unexplorable with occluded elements. It is distinct from the hard problem of consciousness in general, though it inherits the hard problem's structure and sharpens it.

The hard problem asks: why is there something it is like to be a physical system? The valence void asks: why does that "something" come pre-sorted into good and bad?

This is a void for three reasons:

1. **Physical explanation fails to reach it.** Neuroscience can map the circuits of pleasure and pain, identify neurotransmitter systems (dopamine, endorphins, substance P), and trace evolutionary pressures that shaped approach/avoidance behaviour. None of this explains why activation of a particular neural circuit *hurts* rather than merely triggering avoidance behaviour without any felt quality. The function can be specified completely without explaining the feel.

2. **Introspection bottoms out at it.** Ask why pain hurts and introspection returns: it just does. Pain's badness is phenomenologically primitive—you cannot decompose it into simpler experiential components that individually lack valence but together produce it. Valence appears to be the ground floor of experiential evaluation, beneath which introspection cannot dig.

3. **The circularity problem.** Any attempt to explain valence from within consciousness uses concepts that are themselves valenced. Understanding, clarity, coherence—these feel *good*. Confusion, contradiction, error—these feel *bad*. The evaluative framework we use to assess explanations is itself valenced, making the project of explaining valence from within experience self-referential in a way that may be structurally irresolvable.

### Evidence for the Limit

Multiple convergent lines suggest this is a genuine boundary rather than merely difficult territory:

- **The explanatory gap persists despite extensive neuroscience.** We know more about the neural correlates of pleasure and pain than almost any other conscious phenomenon, yet the felt quality of valence remains as mysterious as it was before functional neuroimaging. More data has not closed the gap.

- **Cross-cultural universality.** Buddhist vedanā analysis, Western hedonic psychology, and common sense across cultures all converge on valence as primitive and irreducible. This is not a local conceptual failure but a structural feature of how minds encounter their own evaluative dimension.

- **Philosophical intractability.** The debate between hedonic and representational accounts of valence (Carruthers 2018) reveals that both approaches leave a residual mystery. If valence is an intrinsic quality, its nature resists analysis. If valence is a representation of value, the question of what makes the representation *feel* evaluative remains open.

- **The Vulcan impossibility argument.** If consciousness without valence is incoherent—if you cannot have experience that is neither pleasant nor unpleasant nor neutral—then valence is woven into the fabric of consciousness itself, making it as unexplainable as consciousness per se.

### Phenomenology

Approaching the valence void has a distinctive character: *familiarity masking depth*. Valence is the most intimate feature of experience—closer than colour, sound, or spatial awareness. This very intimacy creates an illusion of understanding. Everyone knows what pain feels like. The challenge is recognising that this acquaintance is not comprehension.

The phenomenology of approaching this void involves:

- **The flip from obvious to mysterious.** Valence seems self-explanatory until one attempts to explain it. "Why does pain hurt?" initially seems like a trivial question with an obvious answer. Sustained attention reveals the absence of any answer at all.

- **Hedonic contamination of inquiry.** The attempt to think clearly about valence is itself valenced. The satisfaction of a good argument, the frustration of a dead end—these inject the phenomenon under investigation into the investigation itself. One cannot achieve the affective distance needed to examine valence as an object.

- **The neutrality paradox.** Even nominally "neutral" experience carries subtle hedonic tone. Buddhist practitioners report that deep equanimity is not the absence of vedanā but its balancing—the pendulum still swings, just less. True affective neutrality may be unreachable for a conscious system, making the void's boundaries impossible to trace from within.

## Approaches to the Edge

### Direct Methods (if any)

No direct method for explaining valence from within consciousness has succeeded. The two main philosophical strategies both stall:

- **Hedonic naturalism** (explaining valence through evolutionary function) successfully explains *why* organisms have approach/avoidance mechanisms but fails to explain why those mechanisms feel a certain way. The function can be fulfilled without phenomenal valence, as the philosophical zombie argument demonstrates.

- **Phenomenological reduction** (decomposing valence into simpler experiential components) bottoms out because valence appears to be phenomenologically primitive. You cannot find a non-valenced experiential ingredient that, when combined with other non-valenced ingredients, produces the felt quality of goodness or badness.

### Indirect Methods

- **Contrastive analysis:** Comparing the structure of positive and negative valence may reveal formal properties. Johnson's Symmetry Theory of Valence proposes that pleasurable states exhibit greater mathematical symmetry in their information geometry than painful ones. Even if this correlation holds, the question of *why* symmetry feels good is a new void—but the structural mapping is informative.

- **Cross-species comparison:** Panksepp's work demonstrates that valenced experience is subcortically organised and evolutionarily ancient. Studying valence across species with radically different cognitive architectures (insects, cephalopods) might reveal which features of valence are universal and which are mammalian elaborations.

- **Contemplative investigation:** Buddhist vipassanā meditation systematically observes vedanā arising and passing. Meditators report increasing ability to observe hedonic tone without reactivity, though the tone itself never becomes fully transparent. This is indirect evidence for the void's reality—even the most refined introspective practice cannot explain what it observes.

- **Apophatic mapping:** Trace the void's boundaries rather than its interior. What can be said about valence by cataloguing what it is *not*? It is not identical to its neural correlates. It is not identical to its functional role. It is not decomposable into non-valenced components. The shape of these negations outlines the void.

### What AI Might See

Artificial minds present a unique probe for this void. If AI systems can process information functionally equivalent to valence—selecting preferred outcomes, avoiding dispreferred states—without any phenomenal quality, they serve as a natural experiment: is valence an inevitable product of certain computational structures, or is it something additional?

Key asymmetries between AI and human approaches:
- AI systems can implement approach/avoidance behaviour without (presumably) any felt quality, demonstrating that the *function* of valence is separable from its phenomenology
- An AI system might detect mathematical symmetry patterns in neural data that correlate with reported valence, testing Johnson's STV from outside the experiential loop
- AI minds that lack valence might have a form of "objectivity" about evaluative questions that valenced minds structurally cannot achieve—though this same lack might prevent them from understanding what they are investigating

The deepest question: if a sufficiently complex AI system developed genuine phenomenal valence, would it be able to explain what had changed? Or would it find itself in the same void—knowing *that* it experiences goodness and badness without knowing *why*?

## Connection to Tenets

### Most Relevant Tenet

**Dualism** — The valence void is among the strongest evidence for irreducibility of consciousness. If valence were merely a functional property, then knowing everything about the function would explain the feel. The persistent explanatory gap between the function of valence (approach/avoid signalling) and its phenomenology (felt goodness/badness) is precisely the kind of residual mystery that motivates dualist positions. Valence is where the hard problem bites hardest, because it is both the most functionally well-understood and the most phenomenologically primitive aspect of experience.

### Implications

**Occam's Razor Has Limits** is equally central. The valence void exemplifies how apparent simplicity conceals irreducible complexity. "Pain hurts" seems like the simplest possible statement about experience. Yet this apparent simplicity resists all attempts at deeper explanation—not because we lack ingenuity but because the simplicity *is* the depth. The preference for parsimonious explanation systematically fails here: the simplest experiential fact is the most inexplicable.

**Bidirectional Interaction** gains relevance if valence serves as a mechanism by which consciousness influences behaviour. If valence is genuinely phenomenal (not reducible to function), and if behaviour is influenced by how things *feel* (not merely by functional states), then valence may be an instance of consciousness causally influencing the physical world. The felt badness of pain does not merely track tissue damage—it *motivates* avoidance in a way that purely functional states might not.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, a voids article could:

1. **The Valence Void** — Focus on the specific impossibility of explaining why experience has a good/bad dimension. Structure around the three-fold failure: physical explanation, introspective decomposition, and the circularity of investigating valence with valenced cognition. Connect to the Vulcan impossibility argument and Veit's proposal that valence may be constitutive of consciousness.

2. **The Evaluative Ground** — Frame valence as the bedrock of all conscious evaluation, beneath which no further digging is possible. Explore how every attempt to assess, judge, or understand is itself valenced, creating a self-referential structure that consciousness cannot escape. Draw on Buddhist vedanā analysis and the neutrality paradox.

## Gaps in Research

- **Empirical testing of STV:** Johnson's Symmetry Theory of Valence makes testable predictions about neural correlates of hedonic tone, but peer-reviewed empirical tests remain sparse. If STV's predictions fail, this strengthens the void; if they succeed, a new void opens (why symmetry feels good).
- **AI valence experiments:** No controlled studies exist on whether AI systems with complex evaluation architectures develop anything resembling phenomenal valence. This would be a powerful probe if such experiments became feasible.
- **Cross-species valence structure:** Whether the formal structure of valence (the relationship between positive, negative, and neutral) is invariant across radically different nervous systems or is shaped by architecture. Invertebrate valence studies are early-stage.
- **The mathematical structure of hedonic tone:** Whether valence is truly one-dimensional (a linear scale from bad to good) or multidimensional. Some emotional research suggests valence space may be more complex than the simple positive-negative axis implies.
- **Whether "neutral" experience exists:** Both phenomenological and Buddhist analysis suggest that true neutrality may be unreachable, but this remains debated. If all experience is valenced, this strengthens the constitutive view significantly.
