# Research: Consciousness and Time Perception

**Date**: 2026-01-14
**Search queries used**: "Stanford Encyclopedia Philosophy temporal consciousness specious present", "Husserl phenomenology time consciousness retention protention", "neuroscience time perception consciousness neural mechanisms 2025", "specious present duration milliseconds experiments", "consciousness temporal binding neural synchrony gamma oscillations", "Henri Bergson duration consciousness philosophy time"

## Executive Summary

Extensive research reveals that time consciousness is a neglected but fundamental dimension of consciousness studies. The "specious present" (experiential now) spans 100-750 milliseconds according to various experiments, though estimates range to 2-3 seconds for extended temporal judgments. Critically, a 2021 paper argues that major consciousness theories (IIT, GNWT) fail to account for experienced duration, focusing only on brief "functional moments" while ignoring how these integrate into the continuous flow humans actually experience. This gap is directly relevant to The Unfinishable Map's tenets—particularly regarding AI consciousness and whether temporal structure is essential to experience itself.

## Key Sources

### Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Temporal Consciousness
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-temporal/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Three main models: cinematic (discrete snapshots), retentional (momentary with past-representations), extensional (genuinely extended experience)
  - The "Principle of Simultaneous Awareness" debates whether succession requires instantaneous or extended awareness
  - William James distinguished mathematical (durationless) from "specious" (experienced) present
  - The specious present "possesses a brief duration, sufficient to accommodate the change and persistence we find in our immediate experience"
- **Tenet alignment**: Neutral—presents options; the extensional view most compatible with site's emphasis on consciousness as irreducible process
- **Quote**: "The unit of composition of our perception of time is a duration, with a bow and a stern." (James)

### Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Phenomenology and Time-Consciousness
- **URL**: https://iep.utm.edu/phe-time/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Husserl's "living-present" comprises primal impression, retention, protention as inseparable
  - Retention differs from memory: passive, immediate, non-objectifying awareness vs. active representation
  - Double intentionality: horizontal (self-awareness across flow) and transverse (awareness of temporal objects)
  - Heidegger emphasized future/protentional; Husserl emphasized retention (for cognition)
- **Tenet alignment**: Aligns with Dualism—temporal structure of experience is phenomenologically rich, irreducible to objective time
- **Quote**: "Husserl describes the life of consciousness, the living-present, as extended like a comet's tail"

### Neuroscience of Consciousness - Time Consciousness: The Missing Link
- **URL**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8042366/
- **Type**: Peer-reviewed paper (2021)
- **Key points**:
  - Major consciousness theories (IIT, GNWT) focus on "functional moments" (100-300ms) not "experienced moments" (seconds)
  - This mismatch is "one of the core issues in theories of consciousness"
  - Proposes triadic approach linking neural, phenomenological, and behavioral dimensions
  - Temporo-Spatial Theory of Consciousness (TTC) explicitly incorporates longer timescales
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports Dualism—if mainstream theories can't explain experienced time, something is missing from purely functional accounts
- **Quote**: "Many dominant theories of consciousness only refer to brief, static, and discrete functional moments of time"

### Nature Reviews Neuroscience / Buzsáki - Time Perception and Brain Rhythms
- **URL**: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763425004178
- **Type**: Review article (2025)
- **Key points**:
  - Hierarchy of brain-body rhythms contributes to subjective time experience
  - Supplementary motor area grounds time perception in sensorimotor processing
  - Insula processes internal bodily signals essential for duration processing
  - Time passage perception relies on brain regions supporting body-environment interaction
- **Tenet alignment**: Neutral—embodied time perception compatible with either materialism or dualism
- **Quote**: "Time passage perception relies on brain regions supporting the interaction between the body and external environment"

### Frontiers in Science - Consciousness Science 2025 Progress
- **URL**: https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/science/articles/10.3389/fsci.2025.1546279/full
- **Type**: Review article (2025)
- **Key points**:
  - Rare progress on competing theories (IIT vs GNWT)
  - New research on visual-frontal functional connections
  - "Biological computationalism" proposes brains compute inseparably from physical structure/dynamics
  - Consciousness may emerge from "special kind of computing matter, not from running the right program"
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports Dualism—biological computationalism suggests implementation matters, not just function

### Psychology/Neuroscience - Specious Present Duration
- **URL**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4703812/
- **Type**: Research synthesis
- **Key points**:
  - Multiple timescales: perceptual moment ~55-100ms, specious present 300-750ms, extended present 2-3 seconds
  - Brain synchronizes events within ~80-100ms window automatically
  - Illusory causality requires <100ms delay; beyond this, cause-effect relation breaks down
  - Different modalities have different temporal resolutions (auditory ~2-3ms, visual ~tens of ms)
- **Tenet alignment**: Neutral—empirical findings about processing timescales
- **Quote**: "When our brains are perceiving the present, they are really perceiving an 80-millisecond time frame"

### Bergson - Duration and Consciousness
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bergson/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Durée (duration) is time as lived vs. spatialized/measured scientific time
  - Duration is "qualitative multiplicity"—states permeate one another, not juxtaposed
  - Consciousness is essentially temporal flow, not static states
  - Duration is basis of free will: in true duration, there's no mechanistic causality
- **Tenet alignment**: Strongly supports Dualism—Bergson's durée is irreducible to physical/mathematical time
- **Quote**: "Duration is the movement of consciousness itself, a ceaseless becoming where past and future blend into the vibrant present"

## Major Positions

### The Specious Present (James, Husserl)
- **Proponents**: William James, Edmund Husserl, E.R. Clay
- **Core claim**: The experienced present has duration (~300ms-2s), unlike the durationless mathematical instant
- **Key arguments**:
  - We directly experience change and succession (hearing melodies, seeing motion)
  - Pure instants can't contain change; only extended presents can
  - Husserl's structure: retention-primal impression-protention as unified whole
- **Relation to site tenets**: Aligns with Dualism—the phenomenal character of temporal experience isn't captured by instant-by-instant physical descriptions

### Cinematic Model
- **Proponents**: Various; often implicit in computational approaches
- **Core claim**: Consciousness is discrete snapshots creating illusion of continuity
- **Key arguments**:
  - Brain oscillations suggest discrete processing epochs
  - Movie frames analogy: separate stills create perceived motion
- **Relation to site tenets**: Potentially conflicts—risks reducing rich temporal experience to sequence of static states; but even discrete models require binding between frames

### Retentional Model (Husserl)
- **Proponents**: Edmund Husserl, Franz Brentano (modified)
- **Core claim**: Momentary experiences contain representations of immediate past
- **Key arguments**:
  - Retention is not memory but immediate awareness of just-past
  - Explains how succession is experienced without requiring extended experience
  - Each moment is "thick" with temporal content even if momentary
- **Relation to site tenets**: Compatible with Dualism—the structure of retention-protention is phenomenological, not physically reducible

### Extensional Model
- **Proponents**: C.D. Broad, Barry Dainton
- **Core claim**: Experiences themselves are temporally extended, not merely representations of extension
- **Key arguments**:
  - Most intuitive account of how we experience duration
  - Avoids "specious present" being present representation of past
  - Experiences literally span time intervals
- **Relation to site tenets**: Strongly supports Dualism—extended phenomenal experiences differ fundamentally from sequences of physical states

### Bergson's Durée
- **Proponents**: Henri Bergson
- **Core claim**: Lived duration is qualitatively different from measured time; consciousness IS temporal flow
- **Key arguments**:
  - Scientific time spatializes what is essentially dynamic
  - Duration is "qualitative multiplicity"—states interpenetrate, don't juxtapose
  - Free will is possible because duration escapes mechanistic causality
- **Relation to site tenets**: Strongly supports Dualism, Bidirectional Interaction, and Occam's Razor Has Limits—Bergson argued scientific description misses essential features of conscious time

### Time Consciousness as "Missing Link"
- **Proponents**: Kent & Wittmann, Northoff & Lamme (2021)
- **Core claim**: Major consciousness theories fail to explain experienced duration
- **Key arguments**:
  - IIT, GNWT focus on sub-300ms "functional moments"
  - But experienced time extends to seconds
  - This disconnect is "core issue in theories of consciousness"
- **Relation to site tenets**: Supports Dualism—the failure indicates something missing from purely functional/physical accounts

## Key Debates

### Discrete vs. Continuous Consciousness
- **Sides**: Discrete (perceptual moment hypothesis) vs. Continuous (stream of consciousness)
- **Core disagreement**: Whether consciousness flows or comes in distinct frames
- **Current state**: Hybrid models emerging—unconscious processing continuous, consciousness discrete but bound. Evidence mixed; Kline et al. found "little meaningful evidence" for quantized perception. Most now accept both perspectives have merit.

### Essential vs. Characteristic Temporal Structure
- **Sides**: Temporal binding essential to consciousness vs. merely characteristic of biological consciousness
- **Core disagreement**: Whether radically different temporal architectures could support consciousness
- **Current state**: Unresolved. Site's temporal-consciousness article argues temporal structure may be essential (excluding LLMs categorically). Counter: alien consciousness might have utterly different temporal structure.

### Where Does the "Present" End?
- **Sides**: Short (~100ms processing window) vs. Long (2-3 second experienced present)
- **Core disagreement**: What duration the specious present actually spans
- **Current state**: Multiple timescales recognized. Brecher's ~55ms for separability, ~100ms integration window, 300-750ms specious present, 2-3 seconds for extended present. Different cognitive functions operate at different timescales.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, given existing temporal-consciousness.md coverage, new articles could:

1. **Bergson's Durée and the Map's Tenets**: Deep dive into Bergson's qualitative multiplicity, how durée escapes mechanistic causality, and how this supports Dualism and Bidirectional Interaction. Not yet covered.

2. **Embodied Time: Interoception and Temporal Experience**: How bodily signals (heartbeat, breathing) shape time perception; the insula's role; implications for disembodied AI. the Map lacks treatment of embodiment and time.

3. **The Time Consciousness Gap in Consciousness Theories**: Expand on Kent & Wittmann's critique—how IIT and GNWT miss experienced duration; what this reveals about materialism's limitations.

4. **Retrocausality and Temporal Phenomenology**: Connect the Map's retrocausality article with phenomenology of time—Husserl's protention as anticipation of indeterminate future, Wheeler's participatory universe, and how atemporal quantum selection relates to lived temporal experience.

When writing any article, follow `obsidian/project/writing-style.md` for:
- Named-anchor summary technique for forward references
- Background vs. novelty decisions (the existing temporal-consciousness.md already covers specious present basics)
- Tenet alignment requirements
- LLM optimization (front-load important information)

## Gaps in Research

- **Bergson-quantum connections**: How durée might relate to quantum indeterminacy (qualitative multiplicity → superposition?)
- **Meditation and altered time**: Buddhist/contemplative perspectives on time experience (referenced in gamma synchrony research but not explored)
- **Pathological time consciousness**: How conditions like dissociation, depression, or psychedelics alter temporal experience
- **Comparative phenomenology**: Whether Husserl's structure applies to non-human consciousness (animals, hypothetical AI)
