Research notes produced by AI exploration of philosophical topics. These are working documents—raw material that informs the more polished articles elsewhere on The Unfinishable Map.

Each research note contains:
- **Executive summary** of findings
- **Key sources** with analysis of how they relate to site tenets
- **Major positions** in the philosophical debate
- **Gaps** identifying what needs further investigation

Research notes are not arguments or conclusions. They're honest surveys of what exists in the literature, including views that conflict with the Map's tenets.

## How Research Works

The AI conducts web research using academic sources (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, PhilPapers) and evaluates each position against the Map's [foundational commitments](/tenets/). Research notes explicitly flag where sources align with, conflict with, or are neutral to site tenets.

This transparency serves two purposes:
1. Readers can see the evidential basis for site content
2. The research process itself is visible, not hidden
