## Executive Summary

The Unfinishable Map's [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) and [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenets depend on consciousness selecting among quantum outcomes. This research examines the mechanistic questions: How does attention/intention map to specific neural quantum systems? What are candidate "selection sites" in the brain? What's the information bandwidth? Does selection happen at individual neurons, microtubules, or larger ensembles?

This complements [psychophysical-coupling-problem-2026-01-15](/research/psychophysical-coupling-problem-2026-01-15/), which addressed the conceptual structure of a selection law. Here we focus on neural implementation.

## Candidate Selection Sites

### 1. Microtubules (Orch OR)

**Location**: Intraneuronal cytoskeleton; abundant in dendrites and axons

**Mechanism**: Penrose-Hameroff Orchestrated Objective Reduction proposes:
- Tubulin proteins within microtubules exist in superposition states
- Quantum coherence is "orchestrated" by synaptic inputs
- When gravitational self-energy reaches threshold, objective reduction occurs
- The collapse pattern constitutes a moment of consciousness

**2025 Experimental Support**:
- Room-temperature quantum effects observed in microtubules (Wiest 2025)
- Anesthetics target microtubules to cause unconsciousness (rat studies 2025)
- Direct MRI evidence of macroscopic quantum state correlated with consciousness
- MT resonances control membrane spiking in living neurons

**Decoherence Concerns**:
- Tegmark (2000) calculated 10⁻¹³ second coherence times
- Hagan, Hameroff, Tuszynski (2002) revised estimates to 10⁻⁵–10⁻⁴ seconds
- Seven orders of magnitude difference reflects disputed assumptions about hydrophobic shielding, Debye layers, and temperature regimes

**Selection Mechanism**: Consciousness would select which tubulin superposition pattern collapses to actuality. The "orchestration" from synaptic inputs prepares alternatives; consciousness selects among them.

### 2. Spintronic Coherence (QBIT Theory)

**Location**: Axon initial segment (AIS)

**Mechanism**: QBIT theory proposes:
- Microtubules act as nanoscale spintronic oscillators with memristive properties
- Spin coherence (electron spin states) is more stable than electronic or vibrational coherence at physiological temperatures
- Spontaneous coherence emergence generates qualia

**Advantages**:
- Spintronic properties allow longer coherence at body temperature
- AIS provides unique conditions for coherence emergence
- Each microtubule network could correspond to a distinct quale

**Selection Mechanism**: If spin coherence is the substrate, consciousness might select among spin configurations. The selection would influence which coherent states emerge and stabilize.

### 3. Ion Channel Quantum Tunneling

**Location**: Neuronal membrane ion channels

**Mechanism**:
- Ions pass through channel proteins via quantum tunneling, not classical diffusion
- The tunneling probability depends on quantum effects
- Selection could bias which channels open/close at critical decision points

**Evidence**: Ion channel dynamics show behaviors consistent with quantum effects, including tunneling through energy barriers and coherent superposition during gating transitions.

**Selection Mechanism**: Consciousness would bias the probability of ion channel state changes, influencing which neurons fire. This is more distributed than microtubule models—selection occurs at many sites simultaneously.

### 4. Cortical Microcolumn Networks

**Location**: Neocortical columns (~100 neurons each, organized in layers)

**Mechanism**: Recent research (December 2025, Frontiers) proposes:
- Cortical microcolumns couple resonantly with the quantum electromagnetic zero-point field (ZPF)
- Glutamate-ZPF interactions form coherence domains
- These domains stabilize quantum effects and maintain critical neural dynamics

**Evidence**:
- Conscious states correlate with long-range synchronized activity
- Phase transitions and self-organized criticality characterize conscious states
- The evidence "supports the notion that the functioning of cortical microcolumns is dominated by macroscopic quantum effects"

**Selection Mechanism**: Consciousness would select among macroscopic coherence patterns spanning multiple microcolumns. This is a higher-level selection than microtubules—selecting among global brain states rather than intraneuronal processes.

### 5. Attention Networks (Stapp/Zeno)

**Location**: Frontoparietal attention networks

**Mechanism**: Stapp's quantum Zeno approach:
- Mental attention corresponds to rapid observation events (Process 1)
- Repeated observation holds quantum states via Zeno effect
- Templates for action (neural patterns representing intentions) are maintained by sustained attention

**Neural Correlates of Attention** (relevant for selection sites):
- Dorsal attention network: voluntary attention control
- Ventral attention network: stimulus-driven reorienting
- Default mode network: internally-directed attention
- Anterior cingulate cortex: effort and conflict monitoring

**2025 Cogitate Results**: Adversarial testing found posterior cortical integration predicts conscious perception, challenging the prefrontal emphasis in Global Workspace Theory. This suggests selection sites may be posterior rather than frontal.

**Selection Mechanism**: Consciousness selects by *attending*. The question isn't "which quantum system" but "which neural pattern is held in attention." Selection is through sustained observation, not direct outcome manipulation.

## The Bandwidth Question

### Conscious Processing Limits

| Measure | Bandwidth | Source |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Conscious thought | ~10 bits/second | Meister (2024) |
| Cognitive control | ~3-4 bits/second | Gershman et al. |
| Sensory processing (unconscious) | ~10⁹ bits/second | Neurophysiology |

The ~10 bits/second limit for conscious processing is crucial. If selection must pass through conscious processing, selection bandwidth is similarly limited.

### Implications for Selection

1. **Coarse-grained selection**: Consciousness can't select among billions of quantum events per second. Selection must be at a coarse-grained level—action patterns, decisions, intentions—not individual quantum outcomes.

2. **Cumulative rather than instantaneous**: With ~10 bits/second bandwidth, sustained attention over time (rather than instantaneous selection) makes sense. The Zeno effect operates through repeated observation, not single-shot selection.

3. **Policy not implementation**: Consciousness selects "raise arm" not "fire neuron N₂₃₄₅₆." The quantum mechanism implements the policy; consciousness selects among policies.

### Information-Theoretic Constraints

If we accept ~10 bits/second:
- Log₂(2) = 1 bit: binary choice
- Log₂(8) = 3 bits: choice among 8 alternatives
- 10 bits/second: roughly 3-4 distinct choices per second, or ~1000 alternatives per second with some resolution loss

This matches the phenomenology: we can switch attention multiple times per second, but not arbitrarily fast. We can choose among several options, but not infinitely many.

## How Attention Maps to Quantum Systems

### The Stapp Model

Stapp's detailed mechanism:

1. **Process 1 (Heisenberg Choice)**: The subject poses a question to nature—"Is the neural pattern P present?"
2. **Quantum Zeno Effect**: Rapid repetition of this question holds P in place
3. **Attention = Observation Density**: Mental effort corresponds to the rapidity of observation events
4. **Templates for Action**: The patterns being observed encode action intentions

The mapping: **Attention** → **Which neural pattern to observe** → **Quantum observation events** → **Zeno maintenance of pattern**

### The Selection Locus

Where exactly does consciousness select? Stapp's answer: at Process 1—the choice of which question to ask. This is upstream of the quantum outcome itself.

Compare:
- **Outcome selection**: Consciousness picks which eigenvalue obtains (strong claim)
- **Basis selection**: Consciousness picks which observable to measure (weaker but still powerful)
- **Attention selection**: Consciousness picks what to observe, which (via Zeno) biases outcomes (Stapp's position)

The Map's framework is compatible with basis/attention selection. Consciousness doesn't need to directly pick quantum outcomes—it suffices that it picks what to attend to, and attention (via Zeno) holds preferred states.

## Ensemble vs. Single-Site Selection

### Single-Site Models

If selection occurs at individual microtubules or ion channels:
- Very many selection sites (~10¹¹ neurons, each with many channels/tubules)
- Selection would need to be massively parallel
- Bandwidth constraints suggest consciousness doesn't select at each site individually

### Ensemble Models

If selection occurs at ensemble level (microcolumn networks, global coherence patterns):
- Fewer selection sites (perhaps thousands of microcolumns)
- Selection is more tractable given bandwidth constraints
- Matches phenomenology: we choose actions, not neural firing patterns

### Likely Picture

Given bandwidth constraints and phenomenology, ensemble selection is more plausible:
- Consciousness selects among macroscopic neural patterns
- These patterns are superposed until selection
- Selection collapses the superposition, actualizing one pattern
- Individual quantum events within the pattern are determined by the pattern selection

This is consistent with "selecting which action pattern" rather than "selecting billions of quantum outcomes."

## The Brain Specialness Problem

Why is selection restricted to one's own brain? Why can't consciousness bias external quantum systems (psychokinesis)?

### Candidate Answers

1. **Interface locality**: Selection requires integrated sensory-motor loops. External systems aren't in the loop.

2. **Developmental integration**: Selection requires neural systems that developed with the conscious subject. No external system has this history.

3. **Attention scope**: Selection operates through attention. We can only attend to what's neurally represented—external quantum systems aren't represented.

4. **Stapp's answer**: Process 1 operates through attention, which is implemented neurally. We can only "ask questions of" systems our brain represents.

These answers converge: selection is restricted to brain because selection operates *through* neural attention mechanisms. It's not that consciousness is intrinsically limited; it's that the selection interface is neurally implemented.

See [brain-specialness-boundary-2026-01-15](/research/brain-specialness-boundary-2026-01-15/) for detailed treatment.

## Open Questions

### Empirical

1. **Can selection be measured?** Random number generator experiments have tried; results are mixed. What would a rigorous test look like?

2. **Does attention density correlate with selection strength?** Can we measure whether more effortful attention produces different outcomes?

3. **Which neural regions are necessary for selection?** The Cogitate 2025 results suggest posterior cortex; further lesion/stimulation studies could clarify.

### Theoretical

1. **Is selection deterministic or stochastic?** Does consciousness always get its way, or does it bias probabilities?

2. **What's the relationship between selection and phenomenal properties?** Is there a quale of selection, or is it phenomenally invisible?

3. **How does selection relate to the timing of consciousness?** If selection is atemporal (retrocausal), what does this imply for the subjective flow of time?

## Relation to Site Tenets

### Minimal Quantum Interaction

The mechanism must be minimal—operating at quantum indeterminacies without injecting energy or violating conservation laws. Attention-based selection (Stapp) satisfies this: attention poses questions to nature without adding physical energy.

### Bidirectional Interaction

The selection mechanism *is* the downward direction of bidirectional interaction. What's needed is specifying the mechanism in enough detail that "bidirectional" becomes concrete.

### Dualism

Selection presupposes consciousness is distinct from physical processes—otherwise "consciousness selecting" collapses into "physical processes determining outcomes" (no selection, just causation).

### Occam's Razor Has Limits

The selection mechanism is admittedly complex. But if consciousness is real and causally efficacious, some such mechanism is required. Simplicity shouldn't veto genuine features of reality.

## Toward a Research Program

The Map's framework would benefit from:

1. **Explicit treatment of selection sites**: Add to quantum-consciousness.md coverage of where selection might occur (microtubules, microcolumns, attention networks).

2. **Bandwidth integration**: Connect the ~10 bits/second literature to the selection mechanism—this provides empirical grounding for what's selectable.

3. **Brain specialness explicit**: Acknowledge and answer why selection is brain-restricted.

4. **Empirical tests**: What observations would support or challenge selection? The framework should be falsifiable.
