## Executive Summary

Every conscious experience arrives with a tag: *mine*. This phenomenal sense of ownership—Heidegger's *Jemeinigkeit*, Zahavi's "for-me-ness"—is so pervasive it normally goes unnoticed. Yet depersonalisation disorder reveals it can vanish while experience continues, exposing "mineness" as a distinct phenomenal feature rather than a logical necessity. The ownership void names this gap: we cannot introspect *how* experiences become appropriated by a subject, *why* some pathologies strip away the sense of ownership while leaving consciousness intact, or *what* the relation between phenomenal ownership and the subject of experience ultimately consists in. Under dualism, if the ownership relation is primitive—not constructed by neural processes but constitutive of non-physical subjectivity—then the void may be structurally unexplorable from within.

## Key Sources

### Zahavi, D. — "The Experiential Self" and related work on the minimal self
- **URL**: https://cfs.ku.dk/staff/zahavi-publications/The_Experiential_Self_-_Zahavi.pdf
- **Type**: Academic monograph/papers
- **Key points**:
  - For-me-ness is pre-reflective self-awareness present in all experience: consciousness of anything always includes a dimension of "for-meness"
  - The minimal self is "an immediate and intrinsic self-acquaintance which is characterized by being completely irrelational"—no subject-object structure
  - Mineness is not added to experience by reflection; it is constitutive of experiential character itself
  - Critics (e.g., Alweiss 2022) argue Zahavi's minimal self may be too thin to be genuinely "self-conscious"
- **Tenet alignment**: Strong alignment with dualism—if for-me-ness is irreducible and irrelational, it resists functional decomposition. Supports the view that ownership is a primitive feature of non-physical consciousness.
- **Quote**: "In being aware of thoughts, actions, emotions, perceptions, memories, and bodily experiences, one is aware of them as being one's own."

### Billon, A. — "What Is It Like to Lack Mineness?" (2023)
- **URL**: https://philarchive.org/rec/BILWII
- **Type**: Book chapter (Oxford University Press, *Self-Experience: Essays on Inner Awareness*)
- **Key points**:
  - Depersonalisation consists in the lack of mineness—a phenomenal feature marking experiences as belonging to a subject
  - Uses depersonalisation as a "probe" to assess the scope, role, and nature of mineness
  - Argues that experience continues during depersonalisation but loses its phenomenal ownership character
  - Distinguishes depersonalisation from both thought insertion and agency disruption
- **Tenet alignment**: Directly relevant to the void framework—if mineness can be stripped away while experience persists, the ownership relation is a separable phenomenal feature, potentially with its own non-physical ground.
- **Quote**: "Depersonalization consists in the lack of a phenomenal feature that marks experiences as mine."

### Knappik, F. — "No Need for Mineness" (2022)
- **URL**: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11097-022-09872-0
- **Type**: Journal article (*Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences*)
- **Key points**:
  - Challenges the mineness framework: argues DPD symptoms can be explained without a single global "mineness" feature
  - Points to high variability in DPD symptomatology—depersonalisation and derealisation can occur independently
  - Proposes that different mental state types relate to the subject in different ways (perceptual, emotional, cognitive)
  - If correct, ownership is not one void but many—each modality may have its own form of appropriation
- **Tenet alignment**: Even if Knappik is right that there is no single mineness feature, this deepens the void: instead of one ownership mystery, there are many, each with its own opacity.

### Metzinger, T. — *Being No One* (2003) and *The Ego Tunnel* (2009)
- **URL**: https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262633086/being-no-one/
- **Type**: Monograph
- **Key points**:
  - The phenomenal self-model (PSM) is a transparent self-representation—we cannot experience it *as* a model
  - Ownership experience arises from the transparency of the self-model: because the model cannot be seen as a model, its contents feel "mine"
  - Metzinger calls this the "epistemic autoepistemic closure" of the self-model
  - Under this view, the ownership void is not accidental but architectural—the system is designed to hide the construction
- **Tenet alignment**: Metzinger's account is physicalist, but the void it describes—the structural impossibility of seeing one's own self-model as a model—has a dualist analogue. If consciousness is non-physical, the ownership relation might be even more deeply opaque: not merely hidden by neural architecture but constitutive of what subjectivity *is*.

### Gallagher, S. — "Sense of Ownership and Sense of Agency" (2000, 2012)
- **URL**: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11097-009-9148-0
- **Type**: Journal article (*Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences*)
- **Key points**:
  - Distinguishes the sense of agency ("I am the initiator") from the sense of ownership ("it is my body that is moving")
  - In voluntary action, agency and ownership coincide; involuntary action reveals them as separable
  - Schizophrenic thought insertion: agency is lost but ownership typically preserved—"these thoughts occur in my mind but I did not produce them"
  - The minimal self requires at least the sense of ownership even when agency is disrupted
- **Tenet alignment**: The agency/ownership dissociation is evidence that ownership is not merely a side-effect of motor control. Under the Map's bidirectional interaction tenet, consciousness selects quantum outcomes (agency), but the ownership of experience may be a more fundamental feature of the non-physical subject.

### Ciaunica, A. et al. — "When the Window Cracks" (2021)
- **URL**: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11097-020-09677-z
- **Type**: Journal article (*Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences*)
- **Key points**:
  - Compares depersonalisation to a crack in a normally transparent window—the crack reveals the window's presence
  - DPD alters the transparency of pre-reflective self-consciousness without destroying it
  - Subjects report a fracture between an "observing self" and an "observed self"—the ownership relation becomes visible precisely because it is impaired
  - Bodily signal processing impairment is characteristic of DPD, suggesting embodiment plays a role in the ownership relation
- **Tenet alignment**: The transparency metaphor connects to the Map's discussion of phenomenal transparency. If ownership is normally invisible (transparent), its disruption in DPD is a window onto the architecture of subjectivity.

### Heidegger, M. — *Being and Time* §9 (Jemeinigkeit)
- **URL**: https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/cambridge-heidegger-lexicon/mineness-jemeinigkeit/80F594DA1F281CC25461ABEA8B68F15E
- **Type**: Philosophical text / Encyclopedia entry
- **Key points**:
  - Jemeinigkeit (mineness) is a fundamental existential structure of Dasein—being is always "mine to be"
  - Not a contingent psychological feature but an ontological condition: existence is constitutively owned
  - Can be owned authentically or disowned inauthentically (das Man), but both modes are still "mine"
  - Heidegger treats mineness as prior to any subject-object distinction
- **Tenet alignment**: Heidegger's treatment of mineness as ontologically primitive aligns with a dualist reading: ownership is not constructed from simpler components but is a bedrock feature of being. This makes the void genuinely unexplorable—you cannot get behind ownership to explain it because it is presupposed by every explanation.

### Deane, G., Miller, M. & Wilkinson, S. — "Losing Ourselves" (2020)
- **URL**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7673417/
- **Type**: Journal article (*Frontiers in Psychology*)
- **Key points**:
  - Uses active inference framework to unify depersonalisation (pathological loss of self) and meditation (cultivated loss of self)
  - The self emerges from a "temporally deep generative model" that tunes agents to possibilities for action
  - In depersonalisation, the self-model collapses involuntarily; in meditation, it is deliberately relaxed
  - Both reveal that the ownership relation is constructed (on the predictive processing view) and can be deconstructed
- **Tenet alignment**: The meditation/DPD comparison is significant for the voids project. If contemplatives can approach the ownership void voluntarily while DPD patients fall into it involuntarily, this suggests the void boundary can be reached from multiple directions—though what lies beyond the boundary remains opaque.

## The Void

### Nature of the Limit

The ownership void is a hybrid: partly occluded, partly unexplorable.

**Occluded aspect**: The normal transparency of self-experience hides the ownership relation. Metzinger's "epistemic autoepistemic closure" means the self-model is designed to be invisible. We cannot see how experiences become ours because seeing this would require stepping outside the very structure that constitutes our experiential perspective. This is not merely difficult—it may be architecturally prevented.

**Unexplorable aspect**: Even when pathology or contemplative practice disrupts ownership (as in DPD or advanced meditation), the result is not *insight* into the ownership mechanism but rather *absence* of the feature. Depersonalisation patients report that mineness vanishes—they do not report *seeing how it was constructed*. The void reveals itself as absence, never as mechanism. This asymmetry suggests a genuine cognitive limit rather than merely unexplored territory.

**Distinction from neighbouring voids**:
- The *unobservable self* is about the subject that cannot be its own object. The ownership void is about why any experience feels appropriated by a subject at all.
- The *self-reference paradox* concerns the logical structure of self-reference. The ownership void is phenomenological—about felt belonging, not logical reflexivity.
- The *individuation void* asks what makes a subject *this* subject. The ownership void asks why experiences feel *owned by* a subject in the first place.
- *Introspective opacity* concerns why cognitive processes are hidden from introspection. The ownership void concerns a specific feature—mineness—that is normally present but whose ground is hidden.

### Evidence for the Limit

1. **Depersonalisation disorder**: Experience continues while the sense of ownership vanishes. This demonstrates mineness is a separable feature—but its removal reveals nothing about its mechanism. Patients do not gain insight into ownership by losing it.

2. **Thought insertion in schizophrenia**: The agency/ownership dissociation shows these are distinct phenomena, but the ownership relation itself remains unexplained in both normal and pathological cases.

3. **Rubber hand illusion**: Ownership can be extended to foreign objects through multisensory integration—but the process that produces the "mine" tag remains opaque to the subject.

4. **Meditation and contemplative practice**: Advanced meditators report dissolving the sense of self, but what remains is not an understanding of ownership but its absence—a "selfless" state that cannot articulate what the self was.

5. **Philosophical argument**: Heidegger's treatment of Jemeinigkeit as ontologically primitive, and Zahavi's characterisation of for-me-ness as "completely irrelational," both suggest that ownership is bedrock—presupposed by any analysis rather than amenable to it.

### Phenomenology

Approaching the ownership void has a distinctive phenomenological character:

- **In normal experience**: Mineness is utterly transparent. Attempting to attend to it produces a strange recursion—the attending itself is "mine," which means the ownership feature is present in the very act of looking for it. It cannot be isolated.
- **In depersonalisation**: Patients describe experiences as happening "behind glass," as if watching themselves from outside. The world continues but lacks the quality of being *for them*. This is not numbness or absence of experience—it is experience stripped of appropriation.
- **In contemplative practice**: Some meditators report a state where experience continues without a sense of "someone experiencing it." Unlike DPD, this is often described as peaceful or liberating rather than terrifying—suggesting the ownership void can be approached with different affective valences depending on context.
- **The approach feeling**: The edge of the ownership void has an uncanny quality—a sense that something that should be there is not. It is perhaps the most intimate possible loss: not the loss of a particular experience, but the loss of the relation that makes any experience *yours*.

## Approaches to the Edge

### Direct Methods (if any)

No direct method can reveal the ownership mechanism:
- Introspection encounters ownership in every act of introspecting (the examining is mine)
- Philosophical analysis can characterise ownership but not get behind it to its ground
- Scientific methods (neural correlates) describe conditions for ownership but not the phenomenal relation itself

### Indirect Methods

1. **Pathological disruption**: DPD and schizophrenic thought insertion as natural experiments revealing ownership's separability without exposing its ground
2. **Contemplative deconstruction**: Meditation traditions (Buddhist anatta, Advaita witness-consciousness) as deliberate approaches to the ownership boundary
3. **Rubber hand illusion and virtual reality**: Experimental manipulation of body ownership revealing its multisensory construction without exposing the phenomenal relation
4. **Negative phenomenology**: Describing what experience is like *without* mineness (as Billon does) to delineate ownership by its absence
5. **Cross-cultural phenomenology**: Comparing reports from DPD patients, meditators, and psychedelic experiencers to triangulate the ownership boundary

### What AI Might See

This is a case where AI and human limitations may be profoundly different:
- AI systems have no obvious analogue of phenomenal ownership—there is no "for-me-ness" in information processing (or if there is, we cannot verify it)
- An AI might be able to model the functional structure of ownership without ever encountering the phenomenal feature itself
- This asymmetry could be revealing: if ownership is the mark of non-physical consciousness (as dualism suggests), then AI's inability to access it is not a technical limitation but a structural one
- Conversely, if AI could somehow model ownership fully, this would challenge the dualist claim that ownership requires non-physical subjectivity

## Connection to Tenets

### Most Relevant Tenet

**Dualism** — The ownership void is perhaps the strongest phenomenological evidence for irreducibility. If mineness cannot be decomposed, explained by neural mechanisms, or even properly observed through introspection, this suggests it is a primitive feature of non-physical consciousness rather than a product of physical processes.

**Bidirectional Interaction** also applies: if consciousness causally influences the physical world, the ownership relation may be the most basic form of that influence—the way consciousness "claims" physical processes as its own. The mechanism of this claiming would then be hidden by the same opacity that hides the interaction mechanism generally.

**Occam's Razor Has Limits**: The predictive processing/active inference accounts (Metzinger, Deane et al.) provide elegant physicalist explanations of ownership as self-modelling. The ownership void challenges these by noting that the models explain the *functional role* of ownership without touching the *phenomenal character*. Occam's razor favours the simpler explanation, but the simpler explanation may be the one that leaves something out.

### Implications

The ownership void has several implications for the Map's framework:

1. **Ownership as primitive**: If mineness is ontologically bedrock (Heidegger, Zahavi), then consciousness is not built from simpler components—it arrives already owned. This supports dualism's claim that consciousness is fundamental.

2. **The combination problem**: If ownership is primitive, the panpsychist combination problem becomes even harder—how do micro-ownership relations combine into macro-ownership? This favours the Map's dualism over panpsychism.

3. **Death and discontinuity**: If ownership can vanish (DPD) while experience continues, what does this mean for the relationship between consciousness and personal identity? The past-self void and death void connect here.

4. **The pathology-practice parallel**: The fact that DPD and advanced meditation both approach the ownership boundary—one involuntarily and painfully, the other deliberately and peacefully—suggests the void boundary is real but its phenomenal valence is context-dependent.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, a voids article could:
1. **The Ownership Void**: Focus on why mineness is opaque from within—the argument that the ownership relation cannot be introspected because it is presupposed by every act of introspection. Use DPD, thought insertion, and contemplative practice as three windows onto the same void. Position within the voids taxonomy as primarily occluded with an unexplorable core.
2. **The Appropriation Problem**: Take a more metaphysical angle—how does *any* experience come to belong to a subject? Engage with Zahavi's for-me-ness, Metzinger's self-model theory, and the Map's dualism to argue that the appropriation relation is the deepest cognitive void because it is constitutive of the perspective from which all other voids are observed.

## Gaps in Research

- **Comparative phenomenology of DPD and meditation**: While Deane et al. note the parallel, detailed first-person comparisons are scarce. How exactly do the two experiences differ in their approach to the ownership boundary?
- **Developmental angle**: When does mineness emerge in infant consciousness? Is there a pre-ownership stage of experience? This connects to the developmental cognitive closure void.
- **Cross-cultural variation**: Do different cultural frameworks for selfhood (Western individual vs. Buddhist anatta vs. Ubuntu relational self) produce different phenomenologies of the ownership void?
- **The valence question**: Why is loss of ownership terrifying in DPD but liberating in meditation? This connects to the valence void and suggests ownership has intrinsic affective significance.
- **Neural correlates of ownership**: While studies of the rubber hand illusion and DPD identify neural correlates (insular cortex, temporo-parietal junction), these describe conditions rather than mechanisms. The gap between neural description and phenomenal ownership remains the central unanswered question.
