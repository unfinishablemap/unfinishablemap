## Executive Summary

Research reveals deep connections between attention and motor planning that support the Map's framework for consciousness operating through the quantum Zeno mechanism. The premotor theory of attention proposes that attention and motor preparation share neural substrates—attention shifts are essentially motor plans. Neural competition models show that multiple action representations exist simultaneously in premotor cortex, competing until one reaches decision threshold. This architecture provides precise candidate loci where quantum effects might influence action selection. Timing constraints are critical: 300ms for willed attention/action deployment, 10-100μs revised decoherence estimates, and millisecond-scale neural processes. The affordance competition hypothesis, basal ganglia selection mechanisms, and beta oscillation dynamics all identify specific windows where consciousness might bias selection among neural options.

## Major Positions

### Stapp's Quantum Zeno Attention-Motor Framework
- **Proponents**: Henry Stapp, Jeffrey Schwartz, Mario Beauregard
- **Core claim**: Mental effort/attention holds neural patterns through quantum Zeno effect; applies to both attention and motor selection
- **Key arguments**:
  - Von Neumann formulation allows observer boundary within brain
  - Ion channels narrow enough for quantum uncertainty principle to apply
  - Mental effort = rapidity of observation events
  - OCD neuroplasticity evidence shows directed attention changes brain structure
- **Relation to site tenets**: Strong alignment with all five tenets; most developed coupling mechanism

### Affordance Competition Model
- **Proponents**: Cisek, Kalaska
- **Core claim**: Action selection occurs through parallel specification of multiple affordances competing until threshold
- **Key arguments**:
  - Neural populations encode multiple options simultaneously
  - Competition biased by contextual/motivational factors
  - Decision when one population reaches threshold
  - Explains reaction time distributions, decision dynamics
- **Relation to site tenets**: Compatible—provides precise locus for quantum selection at threshold crossing

### Premotor Theory of Attention (PMTA)
- **Proponents**: Rizzolatti, Umiltà
- **Core claim**: Attention and motor preparation share neural substrates; attention IS motor planning
- **Key arguments**:
  - Attention shifts preceded by motor activation
  - Same fronto-parietal circuits for overt and covert attention
  - Microstimulation of motor regions affects visual processing
  - Eye movement preparation = spatial attention orientation
- **Relation to site tenets**: Aligns strongly—unifies attention and motor under single selection mechanism

### Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch OR)
- **Proponents**: Penrose, Hameroff
- **Core claim**: Consciousness emerges from quantum computations in microtubules, collapsing via objective reduction
- **Key arguments**:
  - Microtubule quantum coherence at gamma (~40Hz) timescales
  - OR collapse influenced by spacetime geometry (non-computable)
  - Can account for discrete perception, free will
  - Explains anesthesia mechanism (tubulin detuning)
- **Relation to site tenets**: Partially aligned—shares quantum mechanism, differs on collapse trigger and locus

### Decoherence Objection
- **Proponents**: Tegmark, critics
- **Core claim**: Quantum effects decohere too rapidly in warm wet brain for any functional role
- **Key arguments**:
  - Original estimates: 10^-13 seconds decoherence time
  - Neural processes operate at millisecond scales
  - Nine orders of magnitude gap
- **Relation to site tenets**: Direct challenge; Map relies on revised estimates and post-decoherence selection response

## Key Debates

### Attention-Motor Unified Substrate vs Independent Systems
- **Sides**: PMTA (Rizzolatti) vs traditional cognitive psychology
- **Core disagreement**: Whether attention is fundamentally motor preparation or separate cognitive system
- **Current state**: Evidence favors substantial overlap but full equivalence contested; "biased competition" model may integrate both views

### Decoherence Timescale Viability
- **Sides**: Tegmark vs Hameroff/Stapp
- **Core disagreement**: Whether quantum coherence persists long enough in brain to matter
- **Current state**: Revised estimates (10-100 μs) more favorable; 2025 evidence of macroscopic quantum effects in conscious state formation emerging

### Libet Interpretation
- **Sides**: Traditional (brain decides first) vs Schurger (RP is noise)
- **Core disagreement**: Whether readiness potential reflects unconscious decision or stochastic accumulation
- **Current state**: Schurger model widely accepted; Libet's challenge to free will substantially weakened; SMA resection evidence (Sjöberg 2024) supports noise interpretation

### Where Quantum Selection Occurs
- **Sides**: Ion channels (Stapp) vs microtubules (Penrose-Hameroff) vs synaptic vesicle release (Eccles)
- **Core disagreement**: Physical locus of consciousness-quantum interface
- **Current state**: Multiple candidate sites; Stapp's ion channel proposal has advantage of specifying mechanism (Zeno effect); microtubule proposal has revised decoherence support

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, an article could:

1. **Attention-Motor Quantum Interface** (strongest angle for tenets)
   - Unify PMTA with Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism
   - Argument: if attention IS motor planning (PMTA), and attention operates through quantum Zeno (Stapp), then motor selection occurs through same mechanism
   - Leverage: 280ms commitment timing matches willed attention 300ms deployment
   - Leverage: parallel neural signatures (frontal theta) in both domains
   - Strong alignment with Bidirectional Interaction and Minimal Quantum Interaction

2. **Neural Competition and Quantum Threshold Crossing**
   - Focus on affordance competition as selection locus
   - Multiple action representations exist simultaneously (quantum superposition analog)
   - Threshold crossing = selection/collapse
   - Basal ganglia brake-release provides precise mechanism
   - Connect to Map's emphasis on selection among options

3. **Timing Windows for Quantum Motor Selection**
   - Integrate timescale evidence: 10-100 μs coherence, 280ms commitment, 300ms willed deployment
   - Show how different scales might interact
   - Beta oscillation preparation state as "coherence maintenance" phase
   - Commitment point as "collapse" moment

When writing the article, follow `obsidian/project/writing-style.md` for:
- Named-anchor summary technique for forward references
- Background vs. novelty decisions (PMTA, affordance competition well-known; unified quantum framework novel)
- Tenet alignment requirements (strong for all five tenets)
- LLM optimization (front-load the unified mechanism claim)

## Gaps in Research

- **Specific neural populations**: Which specific cell types in PMd/M1 undergo quantum selection?
- **Ion channel specification**: Which ion channels in motor circuits are narrow enough for quantum effects?
- **Beta-quantum connection**: Does beta desynchronization reflect changed coherence properties?
- **Basal ganglia quantum**: Any quantum proposals specific to striatal selection mechanisms?
- **Timing precision**: Exact timescales within the 280ms commitment window
- **Cross-modal coordination**: How do attention and motor quantum selection coordinate when both required?
