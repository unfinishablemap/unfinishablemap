## Executive Summary

Consciousness presents itself as richly detailed and complete — we feel we see the whole room in full colour, hear every instrument in the orchestra, experience an unbroken stream of awareness. Extensive evidence from change blindness, inattentional blindness, saccadic suppression, and blind spot filling-in suggests this sense of plenitude is at least partly illusory. The Plenitude Void is the impossibility of determining, from within experience itself, whether experience is genuinely rich or systematically sparse. The assessment tool (introspection) is implicated in the very illusion it would need to detect, creating a void that may be structurally irresolvable.

## Key Sources

### Alva Noë (ed.) — *Is the Visual World a Grand Illusion?* (2002)
- **URL**: https://journalpsyche.org/articles/0xc0cf.pdf
- **Type**: Edited volume / Journal of Consciousness Studies
- **Key points**:
  - The "grand illusion" debate: change blindness and inattentional blindness suggest we do not enjoy perceptual experiences representing the environment in rich detail
  - The question is whether consciousness constructs a rich picture or operates with sparse representations supplemented by the environment itself
  - Noë's own position (with O'Regan): we do not need rich internal representations because the world serves as its own "outside memory"
- **Tenet alignment**: Occam's Razor Has Limits — the apparent simplicity of visual experience conceals complex machinery
- **Quote**: The grand illusion is "provoked by recent work in psychology on change blindness, inattentional blindness, and related phenomena" which "calls into question whether we really enjoy perceptual experiences which represent the environment in rich detail."

### Daniel Dennett — "The Grand Illusion" and *Consciousness Explained* (1991/2001)
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness_Explained
- **Type**: Book / Essay
- **Key points**:
  - Our brains hold only a few salient details about the world; this sparsity is functional, not a deficiency
  - The brain does not "fill in" the blind spot or saccadic gaps — it simply never notices they need filling ("finding out" vs "filling in")
  - There is no Cartesian Theatre where completed experience is displayed; the Multiple Drafts Model replaces it with parallel discriminations
  - The sense of rich visual detail is itself the illusion — not a representation of richness but a false belief about richness
- **Tenet alignment**: Challenges the Map's dualism directly — Dennett sees the illusion as undermining the reality of phenomenal consciousness. But from a dualist perspective, the illusion itself requires explanation: if experience is sparse, why does it feel rich?
- **Quote**: "We log what has changed and assume the rest has stayed the same, with the result that we miss some details."

### Ned Block — The Overflow Argument (1995, 2007)
- **URL**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6074085/
- **Type**: Multiple papers
- **Key points**:
  - Distinguishes phenomenal consciousness (P-consciousness: what it is like) from access consciousness (A-consciousness: available for reasoning, report, action)
  - The "overflow" argument: phenomenal consciousness is richer than what we can access and report — Sperling experiments show iconic memory contains more than working memory can extract
  - This reverses the grand illusion: experience is not poorer than it seems but richer than we can report
  - The debate between Block and Dennett/Blackmore represents the core tension of the plenitude void
- **Tenet alignment**: Strong alignment with Dualism — Block's overflow argument supports the existence of phenomenal consciousness that exceeds functional/physical access
- **Quote**: "Phenomenal content such as visual iconic memory has rich contents that overflow the sparse system that cognitively accesses perception."

### Susan Blackmore — "The Grand Illusion: Why Consciousness Exists Only When You Look For It" (2002)
- **URL**: https://www.susanblackmore.uk/journalism/the-grand-illusion-why-consciousness-exists-only-when-you-look-for-it/
- **Type**: Article / Lectures
- **Key points**:
  - There is no stream of rich, detailed consciousness — this is the grand illusion
  - When we ask "Am I conscious now?", a retrospective story is concocted, creating the appearance of a stream that was never there
  - Both the stream of consciousness and the self experiencing it are illusory
  - Experience does not have the richness it seems to; the seeming richness is itself the illusion
- **Tenet alignment**: Directly opposes Dualism — but her position faces a self-undermining problem: if consciousness is an illusion, what is being deceived?
- **Quote**: "Every so often something happens to create what seems to have been a stream... a retrospective story is concocted about what was in the stream of consciousness a moment before."

### Eric Schwitzgebel — "The Unreliability of Naive Introspection" (2008)
- **URL**: https://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Naive.htm
- **Type**: Journal article (Philosophical Review)
- **Key points**:
  - We are prone to gross error about our own ongoing conscious experience, even under ideal conditions
  - Introspective reports about basic features of experience (emotional valence, peripheral visual detail, phenomenology of thought) are systematically unreliable
  - Key sources of unreliability: conscious states are fleeting, introspection is theory-laden, the act of introspecting changes what is introspected
  - We cannot determine whether introspection underestimates or overestimates the richness of experience — both directions of error are possible
- **Tenet alignment**: Occam's Razor Has Limits — if introspection is unreliable, simple theories about consciousness based on introspective evidence may be systematically wrong
- **Quote**: "We fail not just in assessing the causes of our mental states... but in assessing even the most basic features of our experience."

### O'Regan & Noë — "A Sensorimotor Account of Vision and Visual Consciousness" (2001)
- **URL**: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12239892/
- **Type**: Journal article (Behavioral and Brain Sciences)
- **Key points**:
  - Seeing is not constructing internal representations but mastering sensorimotor contingencies — patterns of how sensory input changes with action
  - The world serves as its own "outside memory" — no need for rich internal pictures
  - The feeling of visual richness arises from our knowledge that details are accessible through eye movements, not from stored internal detail
  - This explains change blindness: without the right sensorimotor probe, details do not enter experience
- **Tenet alignment**: Challenges simple dualism — but compatible with a view where consciousness uses the body-world loop as its instrument. The non-physical mind might require physical sensorimotor engagement to access detail.

### Michael Tye — "The Grand Illusion" (response essay)
- **URL**: https://inference-review.com/article/the-grand-illusion
- **Type**: Essay
- **Key points**:
  - Defends the richness of visual experience against Dennett and Blackmore
  - If consciousness is an illusion, then nothing appears any way at all — the concept of illusion presupposes appearances, which presuppose consciousness
  - The "transparency" of experience: introspecting an experience reveals qualities of the represented object, not qualities of the experience itself
  - Consciousness must be taken seriously as genuinely rich, not dismissed as confabulation
- **Tenet alignment**: Strong alignment with Dualism — Tye argues that experience is real and rich, and reductive explanations that deny this are self-undermining

### Jesse Prinz — *The Conscious Brain* (2012) / AIR Theory
- **URL**: https://ndpr.nd.edu/reviews/the-conscious-brain-how-attention-engenders-experience/
- **Type**: Book
- **Key points**:
  - Consciousness arises when intermediate-level perceptual representations are modulated by attention (AIR: Attended Intermediate-level Representations)
  - Conscious content is "rich with surface details, located in depth, and presented from a particular point of view"
  - Occupies a middle ground: consciousness is richer than Dennett/Blackmore allow but more constrained than naive introspection suggests
  - Attention is the gateway to consciousness — unattended representations may be processed but not experienced
- **Tenet alignment**: Partial alignment — consciousness has genuine content (supports Dualism) but is constrained by attention (limits Bidirectional Interaction)

### Saccadic Suppression and Blind Spot Research
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccadic_masking
- **Type**: Empirical research (multiple studies)
- **Key points**:
  - During saccadic eye movements (3-4 per second), visual processing is actively suppressed — we are effectively blind for significant portions of waking life
  - The blind spot (where the optic nerve exits the retina) is never experienced as a gap; the brain fills it with surrounding context
  - The brain constructs apparent visual continuity from fundamentally discontinuous input
  - Saccadic suppression begins before the eye movement, indicating central (not retinal) origin — the brain anticipates and pre-emptively suppresses
- **Tenet alignment**: Bidirectional Interaction — if consciousness contributes to the construction of experienced continuity, this is a case of mind shaping what it receives from the physical

## The Void

### Nature of the Limit

The Plenitude Void is a second-order epistemic limit: not merely a gap in what we can experience, but a gap in our ability to assess the completeness of our own experience. It operates at the intersection of the unexplorable and the occluded.

The core problem: consciousness cannot step outside itself to compare its own representations against what it represents. Every introspective assessment of experiential richness occurs within the very system whose richness is in question. The assessor and the assessed are the same.

This creates what might be called **the plenitude paradox**: if experience is sparse but presents itself as rich, we cannot detect the sparsity from within. And if experience is genuinely rich but introspection can only access a fraction of it (Block's overflow), we also cannot detect the richness from within. Both scenarios produce the same introspective result — a sense of fullness that may or may not correspond to actual fullness.

### Evidence for the Limit

**Change blindness**: Subjects fail to notice large changes in visual scenes (people swapping mid-conversation, objects appearing or disappearing) when a brief disruption masks the change. This demonstrates that what feels like a complete visual representation lacks the detail it seems to contain.

**Inattentional blindness**: The invisible gorilla paradigm shows that salient, fully visible objects can be entirely absent from conscious experience when attention is engaged elsewhere. The absence is not registered as a gap.

**Saccadic suppression**: We make 3-4 saccadic eye movements per second, during each of which visual processing is actively suppressed. We experience none of these interruptions. The brain constructs seamless continuity from fundamentally broken input.

**Blind spot filling-in**: The ~6° gap in each eye's visual field where the optic nerve exits is never experienced as a void. The brain extrapolates surrounding information to create an impression of continuous seeing.

**Peripheral vision poverty**: We feel we see colour and detail across the visual field, but high acuity is confined to the foveal ~2°. Peripheral vision is blurry, colour-poor, and low-resolution — yet experience presents a uniformly detailed scene.

### Phenomenology

What approaching this void feels like:

**The check-and-find illusion.** Every time you check whether your experience is detailed, you find detail — because the act of checking directs attention, which generates detail. You can never catch your experience being sparse, because looking creates what was absent. This is not merely a practical difficulty but a structural one: the verification procedure produces the evidence it seeks.

**The completeness confidence.** There is a pervasive sense that everything visible is seen, everything audible is heard, that experience covers the territory without gaps. This confidence persists despite intellectual knowledge of change blindness and peripheral poverty. Knowing about the illusion does not dispel it.

**The retrospective confabulation.** When asked what you just experienced, the report feels authoritative. But change blindness studies show these reports are often wrong about specifics that were fully "visible." The confabulation is not lying — it is the normal mode of introspective report.

**The unbridgeable assessment gap.** Trying to determine whether experience is "really" rich or "really" sparse produces philosophical vertigo. The question seems like it should have a clear answer, but every method of answering it is compromised by the very phenomenon under investigation.

## Approaches to the Edge

### Direct Methods (if any)

The plenitude void resists direct approaches because direct observation generates the plenitude it seeks to test. However:

**Rapid probing:** Change blindness paradigms probe the void indirectly by testing whether supposedly experienced details are actually registered. The results suggest sparsity, but Block objects that failure to report does not prove absence of experience.

**Sperling partial report:** George Sperling's experiments (1960) showed that more information is present in iconic memory than can be extracted into working memory. This is Block's key evidence for overflow — experience is richer than reportable. But the interpretation remains contested.

### Indirect Methods

**Behavioural inconsistency:** If experience were as rich as it seems, subjects should detect large visual changes. They do not. This asymmetry between felt richness and behavioural poverty is indirect evidence that the feeling of richness is inaccurate.

**Neural correlates comparison:** Comparing neural activation during "seen" versus "unseen" stimuli can identify where consciousness begins and ends in neural processing — but interpreting what this means for phenomenal richness requires already knowing whether phenomenal consciousness equals neural activation (the hard problem again).

**Third-person probing of first-person reports:** Schwitzgebel's method — carefully testing introspective reports against behavioural and physiological measures — reveals systematic discrepancies. People are wrong about their emotional experiences, their peripheral vision, their inner speech. These errors map the contours of the plenitude void.

### What AI Might See

AI systems offer a unique asymmetric probe for the plenitude void:

**No plenitude illusion?** An AI processing visual data has determinate access to its own representations. It can compare its representation of a scene against the scene itself. It does not suffer from the illusion that it sees more than it processes. This might make the plenitude void *visible* to AI in a way that it cannot be visible to human consciousness.

**But also no phenomenal experience.** If the plenitude void is specifically about the gap between phenomenal seeming and actual phenomenal content, a system without phenomenal experience cannot encounter it. The void might be exclusively a feature of consciousness, invisible precisely to any system that could objectively assess it.

**The diagnostic paradox.** An AI can detect that humans exhibit change blindness, measure their reporting failures, and catalogue their introspective errors. But it cannot determine whether the human *experienced* the gorilla and failed to report it, or genuinely did not experience it. Block's overflow question remains unresolvable from the outside.

## Connection to Tenets

### Most Relevant Tenet

**Occam's Razor Has Limits** is most directly implicated. The plenitude void demonstrates that the simplest theory about experience — that it is what it seems to be — may be deeply wrong, but the most parsimonious alternative (eliminativism) may also be wrong in the opposite direction. The true situation may be irreducibly complex: experience is neither as rich as it seems nor as sparse as eliminativists claim, and no simple theory captures the actual structure.

### Implications

**Dualism**: The plenitude void provides an unexpected argument for taking phenomenal consciousness seriously. Both Dennett and Blackmore deny the richness of experience, but their arguments depend on a physicalist framework where consciousness reduces to information processing. From a dualist perspective, the *felt quality of completeness* is itself a phenomenal property requiring explanation. Why does sparse processing feel like rich experience? A purely physical system need not feel anything at all — so the fact that incomplete processing generates an illusion of completeness suggests something beyond the physical is involved in constructing the felt quality.

**Bidirectional Interaction**: If consciousness contributes to constructing the sense of plenitude (rather than merely receiving it from neural processing), then the plenitude illusion is itself an instance of mind-brain interaction. Consciousness does not passively receive sparse data and misinterpret it; it actively constructs the sense of fullness, which then influences behaviour (confidence in visual experience, willingness to act on perceived detail). The illusion is a case of consciousness shaping its own input.

**No Many Worlds**: The plenitude void is indexical — it is my experience that seems complete to me. The question of whether my visual experience is rich or sparse cannot be answered from a view from nowhere. This indexicality connects to the No Many Worlds tenet: there is a fact of the matter about what *this* consciousness experiences, not an ensemble of parallel experiences.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, a voids article could:

1. **The Plenitude Void as self-concealing void** — Frame the plenitude illusion as the paradigmatic occluded void: a cognitive limit that actively hides its own existence. Unlike the intrinsic nature void (where we know we don't know), the plenitude void conceals that there is anything to know. Every check confirms plenitude because checking creates it.

2. **The measurement problem of inner experience** — Frame the void through the analogy to quantum measurement: introspection, like measurement, disturbs what it observes. Just as the act of measuring collapses superposition, the act of introspecting generates the experienced detail that was absent before introspection. This creates a structural parallel between the quantum measurement problem and the consciousness assessment problem.

## Gaps in Research

- **The debate remains genuinely unresolved**: Block's overflow argument and Dennett's sparsity argument have not been reconciled. The empirical evidence supports both interpretations depending on what counts as "consciousness."
- **Cross-modal plenitude**: Most research focuses on vision. Whether the plenitude illusion operates similarly for audition, touch, emotion, and thought remains underexplored.
- **Contemplative perspectives**: Whether meditative practices can reveal the plenitude illusion from within — experienced meditators report altered relationship to the sense of experiential fullness, but systematic study is limited.
- **The developmental question**: Do infants experience plenitude, or does the illusion of completeness develop with cognitive maturity? This might distinguish between structural and learned aspects of the void.
- **The evolutionary function**: If the plenitude illusion is universal, it was presumably selected for. What survival advantage does false confidence in experiential completeness provide? This remains speculative.
