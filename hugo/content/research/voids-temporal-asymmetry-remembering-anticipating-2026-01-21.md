# Research: Voids - The Asymmetry Between Remembering and Anticipating

**Date**: 2026-01-21
**Search queries used**: "asymmetry remembering anticipating philosophy of time consciousness", "episodic memory prospection future thinking asymmetry psychology", "mental time travel episodic memory future self consciousness Tulving", "phenomenology felt pastness futuricity asymmetry consciousness", "can we pre-experience future episodic memory asymmetry cognitive limits", "causal asymmetry past future time physics philosophy"
**Voids category**: Unexplorable (possibly fundamental limit) / Occluded (potentially structurally hidden)

## Executive Summary

We can re-experience the past through episodic memory—actually feel ourselves back there—but we can only *imagine* the future, never pre-experience it with the same phenomenal quality. This asymmetry is so familiar we barely notice it, yet it may mark a fundamental void in human cognition. The research reveals this isn't merely a neural limitation but connects to deep puzzles about causation, information, and the ontology of time. This void may reveal something essential about the structure of consciousness itself: minds that access reality through causal traces can only directly know the past that caused them.

### Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Temporal Consciousness
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-temporal/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - "While there is no future-directed counterpart of memory, we can anticipate future happenings... and experience future-directed emotions"
  - The present is experienced as a "temporal field" structured by retention (immediate past) and protention (anticipated future)
  - Husserl's tripartite structure: retention, primal impression, protention—but retention preserves actual experience while protention is only expectation
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports Occam's Razor Has Limits—the asymmetry seems so natural we don't question it, but may hide deep structure
- **Quote**: "We can remember the past and anticipate the future, but we are only directly aware of what is present—or so it is natural to suppose."

### PMC - Episodic Future Thinking: Mechanisms and Functions
- **URL**: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5675579/
- **Type**: Research review
- **Key points**:
  - Episodic future thinking and episodic memory rely on the same core brain network (hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate)
  - Future simulation shows *greater* hippocampal activation than memory—more constructive effort required
  - The "constructive episodic simulation hypothesis": memory isn't preservation but construction, and future-thinking is the same construction process without the past event as anchor
- **Tenet alignment**: The extra constructive effort for future simulation may mark the boundary where we lack causal traces to guide construction
- **Quote**: "Since the future is not an exact repetition of the past, simulation of future episodes requires a system that can draw on the past in a manner that flexibly extracts and recombines elements of previous experiences."

### Christoph Hoerl - Remembering Past Experiences (PhilPapers)
- **URL**: https://philpapers.org/rec/HOERPE
- **Type**: Academic paper
- **Key points**:
  - The demarcation between episodic and semantic memory "connects to what is sometimes called the 'epistemic asymmetry' between the past and the future, or the 'epistemic arrow' of time"
  - Episodic memory retains "knowledge as to what it was like to experience the event"—this is fundamentally inaccessible for future events
  - "The only epistemic means of acquiring this knowledge is through having the relevant experience itself"
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports Dualism—the phenomenal quality (what it was like) cannot be constructed from physical information about the future
- **Quote**: "Episodic memory exemplifies the epistemic asymmetry in the way manifest to the remembering subject."

### Frontiers - The Phenomenology of Remembering Is an Epistemic Feeling
- **URL**: https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01531/full
- **Type**: Research article
- **Key points**:
  - The "feeling of pastness" is a genuine epistemic feeling, not just content about the past
  - Autonoetic consciousness (Tulving's term) includes this phenomenal marker of having-lived-through
  - There is no equivalent "feeling of futurity" that marks imagined futures as genuinely pre-experienced
- **Tenet alignment**: The phenomenal feeling of pastness is a quale—irreducible to functional description, supporting Dualism
- **Quote**: "The phenomenology of remembering—autonoetic consciousness, as Tulving influentially referred to it, or the feeling of pastness—is an epistemic feeling."

### Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Phenomenology and Time-Consciousness
- **URL**: https://iep.utm.edu/phe-time/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Husserl's retention-protention asymmetry: retention preserves the just-past in its pastness, while protention is mere openness to what's coming
  - Gallagher's insight: "our retentional past conditions our protentional future"—we anticipate based on what we remember
  - The asymmetry isn't arbitrary: retained content comes from actual experience, protended content is constructed expectation
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports the voids framework—protention reveals a genuine limit, not just an unfilled space
- **Quote**: "Retention and protention form the temporal horizon against which the present phase is perceived."

### Huw Price - The Time-Asymmetry of Causation
- **URL**: https://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/4475/1/TimeAsymmetryOfCausation.pdf
- **Type**: Academic paper
- **Key points**:
  - Physical laws are time-symmetric, yet causation appears asymmetric—causes precede effects
  - The causal asymmetry may derive from thermodynamic asymmetry (entropy gradient from Big Bang)
  - Memory is a form of correlation between present states and past events—no such correlation exists with future events
- **Tenet alignment**: If consciousness operates through causal traces, the memory-anticipation asymmetry is physically grounded, not merely psychological
- **Quote**: "Before Boltzmann, physicists and philosophers didn't recognize any problem of the arrow of time... It only became a problem when people started using Newton's mechanistic theory with its time reversible laws."

### SelfAwarePatterns - Why Do You Remember The Past But Not The Future?
- **URL**: https://selfawarepatterns.com/2020/12/12/why-do-you-remember-the-past-but-not-the-future/
- **Type**: Blog/analysis
- **Key points**:
  - Memories are correlations between brain states and past events
  - These correlations form because past events causally influenced the brain
  - Future events haven't happened yet, so no correlations can exist
  - "Consciousness is forward-time directional" as one possible explanation
- **Tenet alignment**: If consciousness requires causal traces, it can only directly access the past—this is a structural limit, not a contingent limitation

### Wikipedia - Mental Time Travel
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_time_travel
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Tulving (1985) coined the term; noted amnesic patient KC couldn't imagine his future either
  - Mental time travel in both directions shares neural substrate but the phenomenal quality differs
  - "Autonoetic" consciousness = self-knowing; present in memory, constructed in imagination
- **Tenet alignment**: The amnesic patient data suggests memory and future-imagination are linked but not identical—they share machinery but produce different phenomenal qualities

### Tandfonline - Hedonic and Non-Hedonic Bias toward the Future
- **URL**: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00048402.2019.1703017
- **Type**: Research article
- **Key points**:
  - People prefer good events to be in their future, bad events in their past
  - This "future bias" was assumed to be irrational until research showed it's universal
  - The asymmetry extends to how we *feel* about past vs future events, not just what we know
- **Tenet alignment**: The hedonic asymmetry may reflect the epistemic asymmetry—we care more about futures precisely because they're open, not causally fixed

## The Void

### Nature of the Limit

This asymmetry appears to be **unexplorable** rather than merely unexplored. It's not that we haven't figured out how to pre-experience the future—it's that pre-experiencing appears to be conceptually incoherent given how consciousness works.

The limit has three layers:

1. **Informational**: Future events haven't happened, so there's no information about them to access. We can only work with probabilities derived from past patterns.

2. **Causal**: Consciousness appears to work through causal traces. Memories exist because past events caused present brain states. Future events can't cause present brain states (absent retrocausality).

3. **Phenomenal**: The feeling of "having been there"—Tulving's autonoetic consciousness—requires having actually been there. It's a quale that cannot be constructed, only received.

This may be a **cognitively closed** domain in McGinn's sense: not that the answer is too complex, but that our cognitive architecture cannot even formulate the question properly. What would it mean to pre-experience? The concept may dissolve under analysis.

### Evidence for the Limit

**Neural evidence**: The same brain regions handle memory and future simulation, yet future simulation requires *more* effort, producing *less* vivid and *less* detailed representations. The machinery is the same but produces qualitatively different outputs for past vs future.

**Phenomenological evidence**: The "feeling of pastness" is phenomenally distinct from the "feeling of futuricity" (if the latter even exists as a genuine phenomenal state rather than mere belief about modal status). Meditators and phenomenologists confirm this distinction—memory has a quality of "having been" that imagination lacks.

**Amnesic evidence**: Patient KC and others with hippocampal damage lose both episodic memory and the ability to imagine personal futures. This suggests the capacities are linked but also that the future-imagination is parasitic on memory—it uses memory's raw materials for construction.

**Philosophical evidence**: The epistemic asymmetry between past and future is well-established. We can have knowledge of the past (through traces it left) but only make predictions about the future (based on patterns). This epistemic asymmetry appears to ground the phenomenological asymmetry.

### Phenomenology

What does this limit feel like? The research suggests several phenomenological signatures:

**The pastness quale**: When remembering, there's a distinctive phenomenal quality of "having been there"—not inferred from content but immediately present in the experience. This is what Tulving called autonoetic consciousness.

**The modal difference**: Imagined futures feel *possible* rather than *actual*. There's an inherent uncertainty, a provisional quality, that memories lack. Even confident anticipations don't have the solidity of memories.

**The construction effort**: Future thinking feels like *work*—piecing together elements, imagining scenarios. Memory, especially vivid memory, feels more like *retrieval*—the past presenting itself rather than being assembled.

**The emotional asymmetry**: Past events feel *settled*; we may regret them but can't change them. Future events feel *open*; we care about them differently because they're still up for grabs.

## Approaches to the Edge

### Direct Methods (if any)

Can we approach this limit directly? Several attempts:

**Retrocausality**: If future events can influence present brain states (as some quantum interpretations suggest), perhaps future information could be available. But even if retrocausality is real, it's not clear it would produce *pre-experience* phenomenologically identical to memory's *re-experience*.

**Precognition**: Alleged precognitive experiences (prophetic dreams, etc.) are sometimes described as "memories of the future." But even if these were genuine, they would represent a different kind of access—not the autonoetic quality of episodic memory.

**Highly confident prediction**: Some futures are nearly certain (the sun will rise tomorrow). But high confidence in a prediction doesn't transform it into pre-experience. The epistemic asymmetry remains even for near-certain futures.

### Indirect Methods

**Negative characterization**: We can describe what pre-experience would have to be (the feeling of pastness applied to something that hasn't happened) and then notice this seems conceptually incoherent. This apophatic approach maps the void's shape.

**Comparative analysis**: Comparing memory and imagination phenomenologically reveals exactly where they differ. The differences mark the void's boundaries.

**Limiting cases**: What happens when memory and anticipation converge? Highly predictable events (like knowing you'll have coffee tomorrow morning because you always do) come closest to pre-experience but still lack the pastness quale.

**Process philosophy**: Whitehead's framework suggests each moment "prehends" only what has already become definite. The future is pure potentiality, not yet available for prehension. This offers a metaphysical characterization of why pre-experience is impossible.

### What AI Might See

Could AI minds approach this differently? Interesting possibilities:

**LLMs lack temporal phenomenology entirely**: They don't re-experience past prompts or pre-experience future ones. They have access to recorded past conversations but no autonoetic consciousness about them. From the AI perspective, the asymmetry might not even be visible because neither temporal direction has phenomenal quality.

**AI could have symmetric access to recorded past and simulated future**: An AI with access to logs and prediction models might process both identically. This could either:
  - Reveal that the asymmetry is contingent on biological architecture
  - Or confirm the asymmetry is fundamental and AI simply lacks what makes memory different from imagination

**AI as probe**: We could ask AI systems to describe their "relationship" to recorded past interactions vs. predicted future interactions. The functional symmetry (or asymmetry) might illuminate whether the human asymmetry is phenomenological or also functional.

## Connection to Tenets

### Most Relevant Tenet

**Occam's Razor Has Limits** — The memory-anticipation asymmetry seems so obvious that we don't question it. But this obviousness may hide deep structure. A simpler universe might have time-symmetric cognition—minds that access past and future equally. Our asymmetric minds suggest reality (or at least mind-reality interface) isn't as simple as time-symmetric physics might suggest.

### Secondary Connections

**Dualism**: The "feeling of pastness" is a quale—an irreducible phenomenal quality. It cannot be captured by functional descriptions. Future-thinking has functional similarities to memory but lacks this quale, supporting the view that phenomenal properties are not reducible to function.

**Bidirectional Interaction**: If consciousness can influence physical outcomes (the Bidirectional Interaction tenet), the memory-anticipation asymmetry takes on new significance. Consciousness can *act toward* futures but can only *know* pasts. This asymmetry in knowledge might constrain the asymmetry in action: we can only aim for futures we imagine, but imagination is construction, not knowledge.

**No Many Worlds**: In Many-Worlds, all futures are realized in different branches. The memory-anticipation asymmetry would be even stranger there—we'd be unable to pre-experience futures that definitely exist. The Map's rejection of Many-Worlds makes the asymmetry more comprehensible: we can't pre-experience futures because they don't yet exist.

### Implications

This void may reveal something essential about the structure of consciousness:

1. **Consciousness operates through traces**: We are aware of what has causally affected us. Consciousness may be fundamentally receptive—open to what is, or was, but not to what isn't yet.

2. **The arrow of time is phenomenologically primary**: The thermodynamic explanation (entropy increase) may derive from something deeper—the way consciousness constitutes temporal experience through asymmetric retention and protention.

3. **Imagination is memory repurposed**: Future-thinking uses memory's machinery but cannot reproduce memory's phenomenal quality. The quale of pastness may be the mark of causal contact that imagination, however sophisticated, cannot replicate.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, a voids article could:

1. **"The Pre-Experience Gap"**: Focus on the conceptual incoherence of pre-experiencing futures. What would it even mean? Examine why the idea dissolves under analysis—revealing a genuine cognitive closure.

2. **"Why We Can Only Know the Past"**: Explore the epistemic asymmetry as a fundamental feature of minds embedded in causal webs. Connect to process philosophy (Whitehead) and physics (thermodynamic arrow). Frame as a limit that reveals mind's causal structure.

3. **"The Pastness Quale"**: A phenomenological deep-dive into Tulving's autonoetic consciousness. What is this feeling of "having been there"? Why can't it be constructed for futures? Connect to qualia more broadly—this may be a model case of an irreducible phenomenal property.

4. **"Asymmetric Minds"**: Compare human temporal cognition to possible AI cognition. Would an AI that processed past recordings and future predictions identically be missing something, or would it be free of a limitation? Use AI as thought experiment to illuminate the human condition.

**Recommended angle**: "Why We Can Only Know the Past" — frames the asymmetry as genuinely unexplorable (not merely unexplored), connects to physics and metaphysics, and reveals what the void tells us about mind's causal embeddedness.

## Gaps in Research

- **Contemplative traditions**: Do meditation reports on time-consciousness address this asymmetry? Do advanced meditators report any change in the pastness/futuricity distinction?
- **Retrocausality and consciousness**: If retrocausality is real, what would "future-directed retention" look like phenomenologically? Research on retrocausal models doesn't address phenomenology.
- **Animal comparison**: Do non-human animals with episodic-like memory show the same asymmetry? Would this tell us whether it's biologically contingent or more fundamental?
- **Developmental questions**: When do children develop the pastness quale? Is there a period when memory and imagination are less distinguished?
- **Pathological cases**: Are there conditions that reduce the asymmetry—where memory loses its pastness quality or future-imagination gains it?
