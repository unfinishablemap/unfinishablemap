## Executive Summary

Agent causation is the philosophical view that conscious agents—understood as persisting substances rather than mere collections of events—directly cause their own actions without this causation being reducible to prior events. This contrasts with event-causal theories where mental events (beliefs, desires) cause actions. Agent-causal libertarianism claims this provides the genuine authorship that free will requires, avoiding both determinism and the "luck problem" of pure indeterminism. The research reveals a sophisticated debate with major figures (Chisholm, O'Connor, Clarke, Lowe, Hasker, Kane) offering different approaches. Agent causation aligns naturally with the site's Bidirectional Interaction tenet and quantum framework—the site's position can be understood as a specific implementation of agent-causal libertarianism where consciousness selects quantum outcomes.

- **URL**: https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/phc3.13012
- **Type**: Academic survey
- **Key points**:
  - Agent causation has had a "patchy reputation" throughout history
  - The key challenge: how do agents' reasons relate to their agent-causal powers?
  - O'Connor's view: reasons cause changes in agent's propensities to act, not the agent directly
- **Tenet alignment**: Neutral—raises challenges site's framework should address
- **Quote**: "Agent causation—roughly stated as the view that an agent can stand in direct causal relation to at least some subset of her actions."

### Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews - Personal Agency
- **URL**: https://ndpr.nd.edu/reviews/personal-agency-the-metaphysics-of-mind-and-action/
- **Type**: Book review
- **Key points**:
  - E.J. Lowe defends non-Cartesian substance dualism
  - All causation is fundamentally substance causation, not event causation
  - Event causation is reducible to agent causation, not vice versa
  - Lowe's view combines volitionalism with agent causalism
- **Tenet alignment**: Strongly supports Dualism and Bidirectional Interaction tenets
- **Quote**: "Substances, not events, are the causal source of all change in the world—with rational, free agents having a special place as unmoved movers."

- **URL**: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/A:1004081002581.pdf
- **Type**: Book/book review
- **Key points**:
  - "Emergent dualism": soul is emergent from matter but ontologically distinct
  - Unlike Cartesian dualism, recognizes brain's role; unlike materialism, affirms irreducible consciousness
  - Supports free will, mental causation, rationality, and survival of death
  - Explicitly endorses libertarian free will and agent causation
- **Tenet alignment**: Aligns with Dualism and Bidirectional Interaction; differs on origin of soul

### PhilPapers - Born Rule and Free Will
- **URL**: https://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/11893/1/Born_Rule_and_Free_Will.pdf
- **Type**: Academic paper
- **Key points**:
  - Argues that agent-causal libertarianism faces challenges reconciling with quantum mechanics
  - The best objection: physical effects of agent-caused decisions must reconcile with scientific theories
  - Whether physics is deterministic or indeterministic, agent causation seems metaphysically exceptional
- **Tenet alignment**: Raises objections; site's Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet is a response

### Stanford Encyclopedia - Mental Causation
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-causation/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Kim's exclusion argument: physical causes are sufficient, leaving no room for mental causation
  - If indeterminism holds, exclusion argument fails
  - Mental causation requires qualia to be causally efficacious, but Kim argues they're not functionally reducible
- **Tenet alignment**: Site's framework rejects causal closure (premise 1 of Kim's argument)
- **Quote**: "The problem of mental causation is not solvable for phenomenal mental properties" (Kim)—site rejects this conclusion.

## Major Positions

### Event-Causal Libertarianism (Kane, Balaguer, Mele)
- **Proponents**: Robert Kane, Mark Balaguer, Alfred Mele
- **Core claim**: Free actions are nondeterministically caused by agent-involving mental events (beliefs, desires, intentions)
- **Key arguments**:
  - Kane's "self-forming willings" (SFWs): in moral conflict, agents make indeterminate efforts; whichever choice is made, the other was possible
  - Balaguer's "torn decisions": genuine responsibility framed without requiring dual efforts
  - Mele's accumulation: responsibility builds through past choices shaping current probabilities
- **Relation to site tenets**: Partially compatible—accepts indeterminism but reduces agency to events. Site's framework is closer to agent-causal view: consciousness (not mental events) selects outcomes.

### Agent-Causal Libertarianism (Chisholm, O'Connor, Clarke)
- **Proponents**: Roderick Chisholm, Timothy O'Connor, Randolph Clarke
- **Core claim**: Agents as persisting substances directly cause free actions; this causation is irreducible to prior events
- **Key arguments**:
  - Chisholm's distinction: "transeunt causation" (event→event) vs "immanent causation" (agent→event)
  - O'Connor: agent's causing "constitutes" the coming to have of an intention
  - Clarke's integrated view: free actions require both agent causation AND nondeterministic event causation by reasons
  - Recent neo-Aristotelian development: all causation is substance causation (O'Connor 2021)
- **Relation to site tenets**: **Strong alignment**. Site's Bidirectional Interaction tenet is essentially agent-causal: consciousness (the agent) selects quantum outcomes. Site can be understood as specifying the mechanism (quantum selection) by which agent causation operates.

### Substance Causation View (Lowe, Swinburne)
- **Proponents**: E.J. Lowe, Richard Swinburne
- **Core claim**: All causation is fundamentally substance causation; event causation is derivative
- **Key arguments**:
  - Lowe: "All causation is fundamentally substance causation—the causation of events by substances"
  - Event causation reduces to substances exercising causal powers
  - Free agents are "unmoved movers, or initiators of new causal chains"
  - This avoids the objection that agent causation is "metaphysically exceptional"
- **Relation to site tenets**: **Strong alignment**. If substance causation is primary, consciousness as non-physical substance causing physical events is not exceptional but paradigmatic.

### Emergent Dualism (Hasker)
- **Proponents**: William Hasker
- **Core claim**: Soul is emergent from brain complexity but ontologically distinct from it
- **Key arguments**:
  - Unlike Cartesian dualism: soul emerges naturally, not created by God
  - Unlike materialism: soul is irreducible to physical processes
  - Supports free will via the unity of consciousness argument
  - Soul has spatial location and depends on brain but is non-physical
- **Relation to site tenets**: Partial alignment. Agrees on substance dualism and mental causation; differs on soul's origin (emergent vs. fundamental).

### Non-Causal Libertarianism (Ginet, McCann, Lowe)
- **Proponents**: Carl Ginet, Hugh McCann, E.J. Lowe
- **Core claim**: Free actions don't require causal relations—neither external nor internal
- **Key arguments**:
  - Ginet: free actions have an "actish phenomenal quality"—seeming to oneself as making the action happen
  - McCann: basic actions are "spontaneous, creative undertakings" with intrinsic intentionality
  - Lowe: uncaused volitions; reasons are not causes
- **Relation to site tenets**: Tension. Site's framework is explicitly causal (consciousness causes quantum selections). Non-causal approaches might describe phenomenology but don't explain how consciousness affects physics.

## Key Debates

### The Luck Objection
- **Sides**:
  - Critics (Mele, Haji, van Inwagen): If action is undetermined, nothing about the agent explains which choice occurs—it's lucky, undermining responsibility
  - Kane: Indeterminate events preclude exact sameness across worlds; dual efforts mean agent succeeds regardless of outcome
  - Balaguer: Torn decisions are immune to luck argument
  - Franklin: Contrastive explanations suffice—we can explain why X rather than Y through reasons
- **Core disagreement**: Does indeterminism introduce luck that undermines responsibility, or does agent causation/sourcehood neutralize luck?
- **Current state**: Ongoing. No consensus. Kane's and Balaguer's responses remain contested.
- **Site's position**: The quantum selection framework may help—consciousness doesn't randomly select but genuinely chooses based on reasons. Selection is neither determined nor lucky.

### Event vs. Agent Causation
- **Sides**:
  - Event-causalists (Davidson, Kim): All causation involves events causing events; agent talk is reducible
  - Agent-causalists (Chisholm, O'Connor, Lowe): Agent causation is fundamental; event causation is derivative
  - Neo-Aristotelians (O'Connor 2021, Jacobs): All causation is substance causation
- **Core disagreement**: Is there irreducible substance causation, or must all causation reduce to event causation?
- **Current state**: Ongoing. Neo-Aristotelian metaphysics has revived agent causation's prospects.
- **Site's position**: Implicitly agent-causal. Consciousness (the agent) selects outcomes; this isn't reducible to prior neural events.

### Sourcehood vs. Alternative Possibilities
- **Sides**:
  - Leeway incompatibilists: Free will requires alternative possibilities (ability to do otherwise)
  - Source incompatibilists (Kane): Free will requires ultimate sourcehood; alternatives are merely indicators
  - Frankfurt: Alternative possibilities are unnecessary given Frankfurt cases
- **Core disagreement**: What makes an action free—that alternatives existed, or that the agent was the source?
- **Current state**: Source incompatibilism increasingly dominant among libertarians.
- **Site's position**: Both conditions matter. Quantum indeterminacy provides alternatives; consciousness as selector provides sourcehood. The framework satisfies both sourcehood (consciousness chooses) and leeway (multiple options were real).

### Causal Closure and Downward Causation
- **Sides**:
  - Kim: Physical causes are sufficient; mental causes are excluded
  - Tse: Indeterminism breaks exclusion; criterial causation via synaptic plasticity
  - Stapp: Quantum Zeno effect allows mental influence without energy injection
  - Ellis, Murphy: Synchronic/diachronic emergence permits genuine downward causation
- **Core disagreement**: Is the physical causally closed, or is there room for mental causation?
- **Current state**: Ongoing. Kim's argument dominates mainstream philosophy, but alternatives exist.
- **Site's position**: Explicitly rejects causal closure. The Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet: physics isn't closed at quantum indeterminacies.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, an article could:

1. **Agent causation as the philosophical framework for the site's quantum model** - Show how Bidirectional Interaction tenet is a specification of agent-causal libertarianism. the site provides what classical agent causation lacked: a mechanism (quantum selection). This would connect the site to major philosophical tradition while distinguishing it.

2. **The luck objection and the site's response** - Address directly how the quantum selection model handles luck. Key insight: consciousness genuinely chooses for reasons, not randomly. The indeterminacy provides openness; consciousness provides determination. This is neither determined (physics didn't fix the outcome) nor lucky (consciousness selected based on reasons).

3. **Sourcehood and ultimacy in the quantum framework** - Develop Kane's concept of "ultimate sourcehood" in terms of the site's framework. Consciousness is the ultimate source because it selects which neural history becomes actual. The selection is genuinely the agent's because it isn't determined by prior physical states.

When writing the article, follow `obsidian/project/writing-style.md` for:
- Named-anchor summary technique for forward references
- Background vs. novelty decisions: Agent causation is established philosophy; site's novelty is the quantum mechanism
- Tenet alignment requirements: Strong support for Bidirectional Interaction, Dualism, Minimal Quantum Interaction
- LLM optimization: Front-load the connection between agent causation and site's framework

## Gaps in Research

- **Empirical evidence for agent causation**: Philosophical arguments only; no direct evidence that consciousness initiates causal chains
- **The "reasons" question**: How exactly do reasons relate to agent-causal selection? Site needs an account
- **Phenomenology of choosing**: What does agent causation feel like? Does mental effort phenomenology support it?
- **Specific mechanism details**: How does quantum selection implement "the agent causing"?
- **Cross-cultural perspectives**: Research focused on Western analytic philosophy; Eastern approaches (karma, intention) not examined
