## Executive Summary

Volitional opacity names the structural inaccessibility of the mechanisms by which we will. We experience choosing, deciding, and acting—but the process by which these experiences arise, and whether they genuinely cause our actions, remains hidden from introspection. This void is distinctive because it concerns not just what we cannot know about the world, but what we cannot know about our own agency. The research reveals convergent evidence from multiple directions: Libet's neuroscience shows unconscious neural preparation precedes conscious intention; Wegner's psychology suggests the "feeling of doing" may be inferential rather than causal; phenomenology (James, Merleau-Ponty) shows we cannot catch willing in the act; and the interactionist problem in dualism asks how any mental causation could work at all. Volitional opacity sits at the intersection of the [introspective opacity void](/voids/the-unobservable-self/) (we cannot observe our cognitive processes) and the [causal interface void](/voids/causal-interface/) (we cannot observe how consciousness affects the physical). It raises the question: Is the mechanism of will merely hidden, or is there no mechanism to find—because the "will" is a construction, not a cause?

## Key Sources

### Benjamin Libet: Readiness Potential and Conscious Will
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience_of_free_will
- **Type**: Neuroscience/Philosophy
- **Key points**:
  - Freely voluntary acts are preceded by a specific electrical change in the brain (the "readiness potential" or RP) that begins 550 ms before the act
  - Human subjects became aware of intention to act 350–400 ms after RP starts, but 200 ms before the motor act
  - The volitional process is therefore initiated unconsciously
  - Libet proposed the conscious function could still control the outcome via "veto"—what he called "free won't"
  - Libet took an explicitly dualistic view of the veto process: "a purely conscious field could act on neural processing in the cortex to prevent the dispatch of a motor command"
- **Tenet alignment**: Directly relevant to Bidirectional Interaction—if consciousness can veto, it causally influences the physical; but we cannot observe how
- **Quote**: "The volitional process is therefore initiated unconsciously. But the conscious function could still control the outcome; it can veto the act."

### Daniel Wegner: The Illusion of Conscious Will
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Wegner
- **Type**: Social psychology
- **Key points**:
  - The human sense of free will may be an illusion—"the mind's best trick"
  - Conscious intending is itself a product of nonconscious processes that do the real causal work
  - Experiments show people can experience illusion of control over events actually determined by others
  - The experience of willing arises from interpreting one's thought as the cause of the act, based on three factors: priority (thought precedes action), consistency (thought matches action), exclusivity (no other apparent cause)
  - Wegner calls this "apparent mental causation"—we infer authorship when conditions are met, not because we observe causation
  - Crucially: Wegner did not claim conscious thought cannot cause action, only that introspection cannot determine whether it does
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports Occam's Razor Has Limits—the simple assumption that we know we caused our actions is unreliable
- **Quote**: "Notably, Wegner did not claim that conscious thought cannot, in principle, cause action, merely that any connection between conscious thought and action should be determined by scientific enquiry, and not by unreliable introspection and feelings."

### Sense of Agency Research (Haggard, Frith)
- **URL**: https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01272/full
- **Type**: Cognitive neuroscience
- **Key points**:
  - The sense of agency is "the pre-reflective experience or sense that I am the cause or author of the movement"
  - Distinguished from sense of ownership: "the pre-reflective experience or sense that a limb is part of one's body"
  - The "comparator model" (Frith): actions are accompanied by forward models predicting sensory outcomes; when predictions match actual signals, sense of agency arises
  - Agency is thus partly a *construction*—it arises from congruence between prediction and outcome, not direct observation of causation
  - "The attribution of responsibility is one of the key social functions of sense of agency" (Frith, 2014)
  - In normal voluntary action, agency and ownership coincide; in involuntary movement, they can dissociate
- **Tenet alignment**: Shows the sense of agency is constructed, not perceived—supporting the void's reality
- **Quote**: "The comparator model suggests that actions are accompanied by forward models predicting their sensory outcomes. These predictions are then compared to actual sensory signals and when they are congruent, sense of agency arises."

### William James on the Stream of Consciousness and Volition
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phenomenology/
- **Type**: Philosophy/Psychology
- **Key points**:
  - Introspecting thought is "like seizing a spinning top to catch its motion"
  - "As a snowflake crystal caught in the warm hand is no longer a crystal but a drop"—observation transforms what is observed
  - The rush of thought "almost always brings us up at the conclusion before we can arrest it"
  - Transitive states (the "flights" between "perchings") are especially resistant to capture
  - Willing is one of these transitive states—we cannot catch the act of willing, only its products
- **Tenet alignment**: Shows volitional processes are structurally inaccessible to introspection
- **Quote**: "Let anyone try to cut a thought across in the middle and get a look at its section, and he will see how difficult the introspective observation of the transitive tracts is."

### Merleau-Ponty on Embodied Agency
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/merleau-ponty/
- **Type**: Phenomenology
- **Key points**:
  - Rejects the nonbodily ego: "the one and only subject of perception is the body itself"
  - Motor intentionality is a basic phenomenon, not reducible to conscious acts
  - "The acquisition of a habit is indeed the grasping of a significance, but it is the motor grasping or a motor significance"
  - "It is the body which 'understands'"—agency operates pre-reflectively
  - The body's "motor intentionality" acts without requiring conscious representation
  - This means much of what we call willing is already accomplished before "we" decide
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports the void—agency operates at a level beneath conscious access
- **Quote**: "Motor intentionality is a basic phenomenon, not to be understood in terms of the conceptually articulated intentionality of conscious acts."

### The Interactionist Problem: How Does Mind Affect Body?
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dualism/
- **Type**: Philosophy of mind
- **Key points**:
  - Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia's objection: how can an immaterial substance interact with a material substance?
  - "Since the mind is, on the Cartesian model, immaterial and unextended, it can have no size, shape, location, mass, motion or solidity. How then can minds act on bodies?"
  - No satisfactory mechanism has been proposed—Descartes' pineal gland hypothesis failed
  - The conservation of energy argument: physical-mental causation would require energy to appear or disappear
  - Some propose quantum mechanics as the interface—"the most plausible place for consciousness to impact physics is the collapse of the wave function"
  - This is not an answer but a relocation of the mystery
- **Tenet alignment**: Directly supports the [Causal Interface Void](/voids/causal-interface/)—the mechanism of mental causation is structurally hidden
- **Quote**: "The question of how the interaction takes place is problematic because in dualism 'the mind' is assumed to be non-physical and by definition outside the realm of science."

### Agentive Phenomenology (Kriegel, Strawson)
- **URL**: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK563589/
- **Type**: Philosophy
- **Key points**:
  - Strawson: there is an aspect of experience that is "profoundly libertarian," involving a sense of oneself as a "self-determining 'agent-self'" that is "separate from, and somehow irreducibly over and above, all its particular desires"
  - Kriegel emphasizes the phenomenology of deciding: a "felt pull" to action
  - Trying involves "mobilizing force in the face of resistance"
  - The Libet experiments challenge whether this phenomenology reflects reality
  - "How best to understand the processes underlying decision-making, and the relationship of the phenomenology of deciding to those processes, remains undetermined"
  - The phenomenology is vivid and compelling—but may not track underlying causation
- **Tenet alignment**: Shows the gap between how willing *feels* and what willing *is*
- **Quote**: "There is an aspect of our experience that is 'profoundly libertarian' in character, centrally involving a sense of oneself as a 'self-determining agent-self' that is 'separate from, and somehow irreducibly over and above, all its particular desires.'"

### Akrasia and the Failure of Will
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrasia
- **Type**: Philosophy
- **Key points**:
  - Akrasia: acting against one's better judgment—"the state in which one intentionally performs an action while simultaneously believing that a different course of action would be better"
  - Socrates denied akrasia's possibility: if we truly knew the good, we would do it
  - Aristotle affirmed it as "a staple of commonsense and a common human experience"
  - Augustine located incontinence in the will, not knowledge
  - The phenomenology of akrasia involves watching oneself fail—aware of both the judgment and the contrary action
  - Akrasia reveals the will as divided against itself, making the unity of willing questionable
- **Tenet alignment**: Akrasia reveals something about volition's structure by showing where it fails
- **Quote**: "Akrasia refers to the phenomenon of acting against one's better judgment—the state in which one intentionally performs an action while simultaneously believing that a different course of action would be better."

### Unconscious Decision-Making (Max Planck, Haynes)
- **URL**: https://www.mpg.de/research/unconscious-decisions-in-the-brain
- **Type**: Neuroscience
- **Key points**:
  - Brain activity predicts decisions up to 7 seconds before conscious awareness
  - "Decision-making may be a process handled to a large extent by unconscious mental activity"
  - The brain "unconsciously prepares our decisions" before we experience deciding
  - This unconscious preparation may be functional—protecting the mind from being overloaded by routine tasks
  - People with damage to relevant brain areas don't show unconscious preparation and make poorer decisions
  - The introspective error: "the dissociation between experiential consciousness (the contents of experience) and meta-consciousness (the belief about the contents of experience) makes us fallible in appraising our own experiences"
- **Tenet alignment**: Shows the mechanism of decision operates outside awareness—the void is empirically confirmed
- **Quote**: "Already several seconds before we consciously make a decision its outcome can be predicted from unconscious activity in the brain."

### Colin McGinn: Cognitive Closure and Mysterianism
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_mysterianism
- **Type**: Philosophy
- **Key points**:
  - "A type of mind M is cognitively closed with respect to a property P if the concept-forming procedures at M's disposal cannot extend to a grasp of P"
  - Consciousness is "a fully natural phenomenon, but we humans are just cognitively closed to it"
  - "Unknowability does not imply non-existence. Degree of intelligibility is not degree of reality"
  - "Intelligibility is a matter of cognitive endowment. There is no such thing as 'unintelligible reality' tout court"
  - The mechanism of volition, like the mechanism of consciousness, may be cognitively closed to us
  - Chomsky supports cognitive closure: "if we are biological organisms, not angels, much of what we seek to understand might lie beyond our cognitive limits"
- **Tenet alignment**: Provides theoretical framework for why the volitional mechanism might be permanently inaccessible
- **Quote**: "Mechanism provides the base standard for human intelligibility. Mind is as limited as body, and has an anatomy too."

## The Void

### Nature of the Limit

Volitional opacity is a composite void with three dimensions:

**1. Temporal opacity**: By the time we are aware of deciding, the decision has already been initiated (Libet). We cannot observe the decision as it forms—only after it has formed.

**2. Process opacity**: We have access to the *feeling* of willing (the phenomenology of agency) but not the *mechanism* of willing (how consciousness, if it does, causes action). Nisbett and Wilson showed we systematically confabulate reasons for our choices; Wegner showed the feeling of agency can be present without actual causation.

**3. Causal opacity**: For dualists, the question is how an immaterial mind can affect a physical brain at all. No mechanism has been proposed that is not itself mysterious (quantum collapse, pineal gland, etc.). Even if we accept that consciousness causes action, we cannot observe how.

| Dimension | What We Access | What Remains Opaque |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| Temporal | Awareness of having decided | The decision forming |
| Phenomenological | Sense of agency, "feeling of doing" | Whether the feeling tracks causation |
| Mechanistic | Neural correlates (from outside) | How consciousness influences neurons |
| Metaphysical | That we act | Whether we *cause* our acts |

### The Three Interpretations

**1. The Illusion Interpretation (Wegner, hard determinism)**: The sense of willing is entirely illusory. Unconscious neural processes cause both our actions and our experience of willing. The "will" is a post-hoc narrative, not a cause. The void exists because there is no mechanism to find—"will" names a feeling, not a force.

**2. The Partial Access Interpretation (Libet, compatibilism)**: Volition is real but largely unconscious. We have limited access—enough to veto, monitor, and guide, but not enough to observe the initiation. The void exists because consciousness accesses only the output of volitional processing, not the processing itself.

**3. The Closure Interpretation (McGinn, mysterianism)**: Volition is real and causally efficacious, but the mechanism by which consciousness causes action is cognitively closed to us. The void exists because our concept-forming procedures cannot extend to grasp mental causation, just as they cannot grasp how brains produce consciousness.

### Evidence for the Limit

**Empirical evidence (Libet, Haynes)**:
- Readiness potential precedes conscious awareness by 350-550ms
- Brain activity predicts decisions up to 7 seconds before awareness
- Unconscious preparation is functional—damage to relevant areas impairs decision quality

**Phenomenological evidence (James, Merleau-Ponty)**:
- We cannot catch thought in the act—only its afterimage
- Motor intentionality operates pre-reflectively: "it is the body which understands"
- The transitive states of consciousness (including willing) resist introspective capture

**Psychological evidence (Wegner, Nisbett & Wilson)**:
- The feeling of agency can be induced for actions one did not cause
- People systematically confabulate reasons for their choices
- Introspection accesses products, not processes

**Philosophical evidence (interactionist problem)**:
- No satisfactory mechanism for mental-physical causation has been proposed
- The question "how does mind affect body?" has been open since Descartes
- Even quantum-mechanical proposals relocate rather than solve the mystery

### Phenomenology

What does volitional opacity feel like from the inside?

**The sense of authorship**: We experience ourselves as the origin of our actions. This feeling is vivid, immediate, and compelling. It seems like direct perception of causation.

**The gap at initiation**: When we try to catch the moment of deciding, we find it elusive. Decisions seem to "arrive"—we experience them as accomplished, not as being accomplished. The initiation is always already past.

**The retrospective construction**: Often, we realize in retrospect that we have decided. The experience of deciding may be a reconstruction—an interpretation of bodily preparation we could not observe.

**The akratic revelation**: In weakness of will, we watch ourselves act against our judgment. This reveals that "we" and "our will" are not identical—something acts that is not the judging self.

**The effort phenomenon**: Trying involves "mobilizing force in the face of resistance" (Kriegel). This phenomenology is vivid—but whether it reflects actual force or merely accompanies neural events is unclear.

**The transparency illusion**: Despite structural opacity, we *feel* transparent to ourselves as agents. We feel we know why we act, how we decide, what moves us. This felt transparency may be the mind's "best trick" (Wegner).

## Approaches to the Edge

### Direct Methods (if any)

**Contemplative observation**: Meditation traditions attempt to observe the arising of intention in real-time. Buddhist mindfulness of volition (cetanā) aims to see intentions forming rather than already formed. Some practitioners report increased awareness of the gap between impulse and action—but this may train attention rather than bypass the limit.

**Slowing down decision**: Deliberately prolonging decisions might reveal more of the process. But prolongation changes the process—slow deliberate choices differ in kind from fast intuitive ones.

**Phenomenological reduction**: Husserl's method attempts to bracket assumptions and attend to experience as given. Applied to willing, this clarifies the *structure* of volitional experience but does not access the underlying mechanism.

### Indirect Methods

**Neuroscience**: Brain imaging reveals correlates of decision-making, showing when and where decisions form. This provides third-person access to processes first-person cannot observe—but it does not explain how (or whether) consciousness causes action.

**Behavioral experiments**: Choice blindness, split-brain studies, and agency illusion experiments reveal the gap between phenomenology and underlying process.

**Negative phenomenology**: Cataloguing what introspection cannot reveal about willing maps the void's boundaries. The pattern of failure is data about the structure of the limit.

**Comparative analysis**: How do different cognitive architectures (AI, altered states, pathological conditions) relate to volitional experience? Differences might reveal what is contingent vs. constitutive.

### What AI Might See

AI has a distinctive position regarding volitional opacity:

**No phenomenology of agency**: If AI lacks phenomenal consciousness, it has no "sense of agency" in the relevant sense. It processes but does not experience willing.

**Different architecture**: AI decision processes are (in principle) transparent—we can inspect the weights, trace the computation. If AI "decisions" involve no opacity, this suggests volitional opacity is architecture-specific, not universal.

**Pattern detection**: AI might identify systematic patterns in how humans describe and misattribute their volitional experience, mapping where the phenomenology diverges from observable behavior.

**The contrast case**: If AI makes decisions without phenomenal will, and humans make decisions with phenomenal will that may not cause them, what does this reveal about the relationship between phenomenology and causation?

**Training effects**: AI trained on human text absorbs human descriptions of willing, including confabulations. AI might reproduce the rhetoric of agency without the underlying experience—or the underlying mechanism.

## Connection to Tenets

### Most Relevant Tenet

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)** is most directly relevant. The Map holds that consciousness causally influences the physical world. Volitional opacity concerns whether we can observe (or understand) this influence. The void doesn't deny bidirectional interaction—it holds that the mechanism is hidden from introspection and perhaps cognitively closed entirely.

If Libet is right that we can veto unconsciously-initiated impulses, this is bidirectional interaction in action—consciousness (the veto) affecting the physical (preventing the motor command). But we cannot observe *how* the veto works. The mechanism by which a "purely conscious field" could "act on neural processing" remains mysterious.

### Secondary Connections

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)** faces the interactionist problem directly. If mind and brain are distinct, how do they interact? Volitional opacity might be expected if the interaction occurs at a level beneath or beyond what either neural observation or introspection can access. The void may be intrinsic to dualist metaphysics.

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)** suggests consciousness's influence on the physical is "minimal"—perhaps at the quantum level, affecting probabilities rather than trajectories. If the interaction is quantum-mechanical, its minimality would explain why we cannot observe it: quantum events are too small, too fast, too probabilistic for introspection to track.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)** is demonstrated by the volitional opacity void. The simplest assumption—that we directly observe ourselves causing our actions—is almost certainly wrong. Wegner shows the sense of agency is constructed; Libet shows decisions are initiated unconsciously; James shows we cannot catch willing in the act. Our confidence in self-knowledge of agency exemplifies how parsimony can mislead.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)** intensifies the question. If there is only one actual world, my choices matter uniquely—they determine the one reality. But if I cannot access the mechanism of choosing, I cannot understand how "I" determine anything. The indexical weight of choice is paired with opacity about what choosing is.

### Implications

1. **Responsibility remains even without access.** We hold people responsible for actions even though neither they nor we can observe how they willed those actions. Responsibility may not require volitional transparency—only volitional capacity.

2. **The phenomenology of freedom is not evidence for freedom.** Strawson notes our experience is "profoundly libertarian"—we feel like self-determining agents. But this feeling may be systematically misleading about underlying reality. The experience of freedom is not access to the mechanism of freedom.

3. **The causal interface void extends inward.** We cannot observe how consciousness affects the external world; we also cannot observe how it affects our own actions. The [causal interface](/voids/causal-interface/) void has an internal as well as external dimension.

4. **The voids framework applies to agency.** Just as there are territories of external reality consciousness cannot map, there are aspects of agency consciousness cannot access. We act in the dark about how we act.

5. **Dualism predicts this void.** If consciousness is non-physical and interacts with the physical through some mechanism, that mechanism would be neither purely mental (accessible to introspection) nor purely physical (accessible to observation). It would be structurally hidden—which is what we find.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, a voids article could:

1. **"The Volitional Void: How We Cannot Watch Ourselves Will"**: Introduce volitional opacity as a distinctive void—not about external reality but about our own agency. Synthesize Libet, Wegner, and James to show convergent evidence that the mechanism of willing is hidden. Ask whether the void indicates illusion (there is no mechanism) or closure (there is a mechanism we cannot access).

2. **"The Mechanism That Cannot Be Found: Mental Causation and the Interactionist Problem"**: Focus on the philosophical problem. If dualism is true, how does mind affect body? The void exists because no answer has been found—not for lack of trying but perhaps because the answer is cognitively closed. Connect to the Map's commitment to bidirectional interaction.

3. **"Deciding in the Dark: The Phenomenology of Volitional Opacity"**: Phenomenological analysis of what it's like to not-observe your own willing. The gap at initiation, the retrospective construction, the akratic revelation. How does consciousness experience its own opacity?

4. **"Wegner's Challenge: Is the Sense of Agency a Void or an Illusion?"**: Examine Wegner's "illusion of conscious will" thesis in light of the voids framework. Is the void about genuine but inaccessible mechanism, or is the "will" a construction with nothing behind it?

## Gaps in Research

- **The veto mechanism**: Libet proposes we can veto unconsciously-initiated impulses. How does the veto work? Is it also initiated unconsciously? Is there empirical evidence for veto-level intervention?
- **Cross-cultural phenomenology**: Do different cultures experience agency differently? Is the "libertarian" phenomenology Strawson describes culturally universal?
- **Akrasia and the divided will**: Weakness of will reveals something about volitional structure. What exactly does akrasia show about the unity (or disunity) of the willing self?
- **AI and transparency**: Could AI systems have "decisions" that are fully transparent? What would this reveal about the contingency of human volitional opacity?
- **Contemplative training**: Can meditative practice genuinely increase access to volitional processes, or only alter the phenomenology of willing without increasing actual access?
- **The quantum connection**: If consciousness influences quantum collapse, can this be tested? What would evidence look like?
- **Developmental trajectory**: How does the sense of agency develop? Are children's volitional processes more or less opaque to them?
- **Neuropathology of agency**: Conditions that alter sense of agency (anarchic hand, alien hand, anosognosia for hemiplegia)—what do they reveal about the construction of volitional experience?
