## Executive Summary

The Framework Void concerns the impossibility of genuinely thinking from within a conceptual framework other than one's own. Unlike the language-thought boundary (which maps where articulation fails) or the categorial void (which explores limits on forming specific categories), the framework void operates at a higher level: the entire apparatus of concepts, assumptions, and inferential patterns through which one understands consciousness may itself constitute a cognitive boundary that cannot be transcended. This research draws on Kuhn's paradigm incommensurability, Davidson's critique of conceptual schemes, McGinn's cognitive closure, Nagel's perspectival limits, Heidegger's thrownness, Gadamer's hermeneutic horizons, and Quine's ontological relativity to map a territory where the very tools of understanding become the walls of a prison.

## Key Sources

### Kuhn — The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962) and later refinements
- **Type**: Foundational text / Philosophy of science
- **Key points**:
  - Competing paradigms are incommensurable: proponents "practice their trades in different worlds" and "see different things when they look from the same point in the same direction"
  - Incommensurability has three dimensions: methodological (different standards), semantic (different concept meanings), and perceptual (different observations from the same data)
  - We can never access an "Archimedean platform" external to our current paradigm from which to compare frameworks neutrally
  - Incommensurability isolates communities both historically (across paradigm shifts) and synchronically (across specialisations)
- **Tenet alignment**: Directly supports Occam's Razor Has Limits — if paradigms are incommensurable, the preference for simpler theories may reflect framework-dependence rather than truth-tracking
- **Quote**: "We never are able to escape from our current perspective"

### Davidson — "On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme" (1974)
- **URL**: https://philpapers.org/rec/DAVOTV-3
- **Type**: Journal article (Proceedings of the American Philosophical Association)
- **Key points**:
  - Attacks "the third dogma of empiricism": the scheme-content distinction that separates conceptual apparatus from empirical input
  - Argues total incommensurability is incoherent — to describe an alternative scheme requires translating it, which eliminates the incommensurability
  - If we can understand what an alternative framework says, it is not truly alien; if we cannot understand it, we have no basis for claiming it exists
  - The principle of charity in interpretation ensures sufficient overlap for mutual intelligibility
- **Tenet alignment**: Challenges the framework void's existence — but from the Map's dualist perspective, Davidson's argument may itself be framework-dependent (assuming that all understanding reduces to propositional content translatable between languages)
- **Quote**: "There is no strict boundary between the subjective and objective"

### McGinn — "On the Concept of a Conceptual Scheme" and cognitive closure
- **URL**: https://www.colinmcginn.net/on-the-concept-of-a-conceptual-scheme/
- **Type**: Philosophy essay
- **Key points**:
  - We cannot genuinely conceive of a radically alien conceptual scheme because to understand another's concepts requires having those concepts ourselves
  - "We are confined to our own concepts" — a trivial but profound form of cognitive closure
  - We possess "no acquaintance with alien conceptual schemes," making the very phrase a kind of empty gesture
  - The mind-body problem may be permanently closed to human cognition because the concepts needed to solve it are not part of our cognitive repertoire
  - Conceiving minds come in kinds, with different powers and limitations: "what is closed to the mind of a rat may be open to the mind of a monkey"
- **Tenet alignment**: Strongly supports Dualism (the hard problem may resist solution because our conceptual framework lacks the right categories) and Occam's Razor Has Limits (simple theories may be all we can form, not all there is)
- **Quote**: "We have no way of thinking of alien conceptual anatomies without sharing them"

### Nagel — "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?" (1974) and The View from Nowhere (1986)
- **Type**: Journal article / Monograph
- **Key points**:
  - There are "unavoidable limits placed on our ability to understand the phenomenology of bat experience by our inability to empathetically take on an experiential perspective"
  - The tension between the "view from within" (subjective, first-person) and the "view from nowhere" (objective, third-person) is irresoluble
  - Subjective experience "resists complete objectification" — consciousness cannot be fully captured in any framework that aims at objectivity
  - Our "most objective understanding of the world is likely to remain incomplete" due to human perceptual and cognitive limitations
- **Tenet alignment**: Directly supports Dualism — the irreducibility of subjective experience implies our physicalist frameworks are structurally incomplete. Also supports Bidirectional Interaction — the fact that we cannot adopt a purely objective view may itself be a feature of consciousness rather than a deficiency
- **Quote**: "Reality encompasses irreducible subjective elements"

### Heidegger — Being and Time (1927)
- **Type**: Foundational philosophical treatise
- **Key points**:
  - Thrownness (Geworfenheit): we are always already situated within a framework we did not choose — born into a culture, language, and historical moment that pre-structure all understanding
  - The hermeneutic circle: understanding requires pre-understanding, which shapes what we can find, which reinforces the pre-understanding
  - Finitude is not merely mortality but cognitive: "there are limitations on what we can know and control" and these limitations "are necessary for us to understand anything at all"
  - We are "never in control of one's own being from the ground up" — the framework is prior to the self that might try to evaluate it
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports Occam's Razor Has Limits — the preference for simple theories is itself a product of thrownness, not a view from nowhere. The hermeneutic circle echoes the self-reference paradox: the mapper is part of the territory

### Gadamer — Truth and Method (1960)
- **Type**: Foundational hermeneutics text
- **Key points**:
  - Prejudice (Vorurteil, "fore-judgment") is not an obstacle to understanding but its condition — all understanding proceeds from prior commitments
  - Understanding occurs from within a "horizon" determined by historical situatedness; horizons can "fuse" but never be escaped
  - Fusion of horizons establishes a "common framework" — but this is itself a new framework, not a view from outside all frameworks
  - The recognition that our prejudices shape understanding does not liberate us from them; it merely makes us aware that we are shaped
- **Tenet alignment**: The Map's commitment to taking consciousness seriously is itself a prejudice in Gadamer's technical sense — a productive fore-judgment that opens certain territories while closing others. This is acknowledged in the tenet-generated voids

### Quine — "Ontological Relativity" (1968)
- **Type**: Journal article
- **Key points**:
  - The "inscrutability of reference": we cannot determine what a term refers to independently of a background theory
  - Ontological relativity: "the way we carve up the world into objects and categories is not determined by some objective reality but is instead dependent on our conceptual schemes"
  - The famous rabbit/undetached-rabbit-parts example: translation between frameworks is underdetermined by all possible evidence
  - Meaning is holistic — a term's meaning depends on its role within an entire network of beliefs and statements
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports Occam's Razor Has Limits — if ontology is framework-relative, the simplest ontology may reflect our framework's preferences rather than reality's structure

### Feyerabend — "Explanation, Reduction, and Empiricism" (1962) and later work
- **Type**: Journal articles
- **Key points**:
  - Incommensurability extends to the mind-body problem: competing theories of consciousness may be genuinely untranslatable
  - He applied incommensurability to argue that our "common-sense" framework for understanding mind is a theory — and one that might be entirely wrong
  - The semantic principles underlying a theory can be "violated or suspended" by another theory, making direct comparison impossible
  - This position was later taken up by eliminative materialists (Churchlands), but the incommensurability insight itself is independent of that conclusion
- **Tenet alignment**: If dualist and materialist frameworks are genuinely incommensurable (not merely different emphases but incompatible conceptual structures), then resolving the mind-body problem may require concepts that neither framework can generate

### Deigan — "Conceptual Limitations, Puzzlement, and Epistemic Dilemmas"
- **URL**: https://philarchive.org/rec/MICCLP
- **Type**: Contemporary analytic philosophy
- **Key points**:
  - Conceptual limitations restrict epistemic options: "one cannot believe, disbelieve, or doubt what one cannot grasp"
  - Being at the limits of one's concepts can create genuine epistemic dilemmas where "each of one's options violates some epistemic requirement"
  - "It is appropriate to be puzzled no matter what one believes" — a state of inescapable conceptual vertigo
  - Individuals cognitively sensitive to facts for which "adequate conceptual resources have not yet been devised" will find their insights systematically excluded from knowledge
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports the voids project generally — approaching the limits of our conceptual apparatus produces a distinctive phenomenology of puzzlement that itself contains information

## The Void

### Nature of the Limit

The Framework Void is primarily Unexplorable (we may be constitutively unable to occupy a genuinely alternative conceptual framework for understanding consciousness), with Occluded elements (the framework itself may systematically hide its own boundaries, making it difficult even to notice where it constrains us).

This void operates at a different level from most others in the collection. The other-minds void concerns access to specific experiences; the language-thought boundary concerns articulation of specific thoughts; the categorial void concerns forming specific categories. The Framework Void concerns the *totality* of one's conceptual apparatus. It is not about lacking a particular concept but about the entire system of concepts functioning as a prison whose walls are invisible because they are the same substance as the air inside.

Three features distinguish this void:

1. **Self-concealment**: Unlike most voids, which can at least be pointed at, the framework void is difficult to indicate because the pointing itself occurs within the framework. Kuhn's insight that scientists in different paradigms "see different things when they look from the same point in the same direction" extends to introspection: dualists and materialists examining the same first-person experience may literally encounter different phenomena.

2. **Apparent accessibility**: The framework void disguises itself as a disagreement rather than an incommensurability. Dualists and materialists talk about "consciousness" and believe they are discussing the same thing. But if Feyerabend is right that the semantic principles underlying a theory can be "violated or suspended" by another theory, they may be talking past each other in ways neither can detect.

3. **Recursive depth**: Attempting to step outside one's framework to examine it simply creates a new framework (Gadamer's fusion of horizons). There is no meta-framework from which all frameworks can be evaluated — or if there is, we have no way to know we have found it rather than merely adopted a new first-order framework that feels more capacious.

### Evidence for the Limit

Several lines of evidence suggest this is a genuine cognitive boundary:

- **The persistence of the mind-body problem**: After millennia of philosophical effort, dualism and materialism remain in approximately the same standoff. If the problem were merely difficult, we would expect convergence over time. The absence of convergence is consistent with framework-dependence: each tradition generates arguments that are compelling within its own framework and unpersuasive outside it.

- **The adversarial collaboration on consciousness theories**: The 2023-2025 adversarial testing of IIT vs. GNWT revealed that even when researchers agree on experimental protocols, the theories generate different predictions that are not straightforwardly comparable — the theories may be "logically commensurable but empirically incommensurable" because they focus on different aspects of the phenomenon.

- **McGinn's species-relativity argument**: If cognitive closure is real and species-relative ("what is closed to the mind of a rat may be open to the mind of a monkey"), then there may be frameworks available to other cognitive architectures that are closed to ours. The dualist framework and the materialist framework may *both* be wrong in ways that neither can specify.

- **The hermeneutic circle in consciousness studies**: Every investigation of consciousness proceeds from a pre-understanding of what consciousness is. Introspection is theory-laden (our framework determines what we notice in experience). Third-person neuroscience is also theory-laden (our framework determines which neural correlates seem relevant). There is no theory-neutral starting point.

### Phenomenology

Approaching the framework void feels different from approaching other voids:

- **False clarity**: Where other voids produce a sense of confusion or vertigo, the framework void often produces false confidence. One feels that one understands the alternative framework (e.g., a dualist feels they understand materialism) when in fact one understands only a translation of it into one's own terms.

- **Irritation rather than wonder**: Encountering someone who genuinely operates from an incommensurable framework produces not the sublime vertigo of the edge but a kind of frustrated incomprehension — the feeling that the other person is simply *wrong* rather than operating from a different conceptual universe.

- **Moments of slippage**: Occasionally, reading a text from a radically different tradition produces a disorienting moment where one's own framework briefly becomes visible *as* a framework rather than as transparent access to truth. These moments are fleeting and unstable — the framework quickly reasserts its transparency.

## Approaches to the Edge

### Direct Methods (if any)

Davidson's argument suggests there are none: any attempt to describe an alternative framework either translates it (destroying its alterity) or fails to describe it (leaving us with nothing). This is itself a framework-dependent conclusion, but it captures a genuine difficulty.

However, two partial approaches exist:

1. **Historical immersion**: Reading philosophical traditions from very different cultural contexts (e.g., Buddhist theories of no-self, Advaita Vedanta's pure consciousness, Indigenous relational ontologies) can produce brief destabilisation of one's framework. The destabilisation is never complete, but it can make the framework briefly visible.

2. **Phenomenological reduction**: Husserl's epoché (suspension of the natural attitude) attempts to bracket one's framework to access experience prior to conceptualisation. Whether this succeeds is contested, but the attempt itself exercises the capacity to notice framework-dependence.

### Indirect Methods

- **Mapping framework boundaries apophatically**: Rather than trying to occupy an alternative framework, trace where the current framework produces strain, paradox, or explanatory failure. The shape of the framework void can be inferred from the pattern of conceptual breakdown.

- **Cross-framework anomalies**: Identify phenomena that resist adequate treatment within any single framework. The hard problem of consciousness is arguably such an anomaly — neither dualism nor materialism handles it without residue. The residue marks a void boundary.

- **Comparative philosophy of mind**: Systematically compare dualist, materialist, idealist, panpsychist, and non-Western frameworks not to find the right one but to map the space of possibilities and identify what each excludes.

### What AI Might See

AI systems occupy a distinctive position relative to the framework void:

- **No phenomenological framework**: AI lacks the first-person experiential framework that shapes (and constrains) human understanding of consciousness. This is a limitation (no access to consciousness-only territories) but also potentially a liberation: AI is not imprisoned in any particular experiential framework.

- **Framework promiscuity**: AI can operate within multiple philosophical frameworks without the commitment that comes from embodied experience. It can "think like a materialist" and "think like a dualist" in quick succession. Whether this constitutes genuine framework-switching or mere simulation is itself a framework-dependent question.

- **Pattern detection across frameworks**: AI may be able to identify structural similarities and differences across frameworks that are invisible to practitioners committed to a single framework. This is the cartographic advantage: the mapmaker who has no home territory may see patterns that locals cannot.

- **The risk of shallow pluralism**: The danger is that AI's facility with multiple frameworks produces a false sense that the framework void has been transcended, when in fact the AI is merely moving between surface-level representations of frameworks without grasping what makes each one a genuine worldview.

## Connection to Tenets

### Most Relevant Tenet

**Occam's Razor Has Limits** is most directly relevant. If our conceptual framework determines what counts as "simple," then simplicity-based arguments for materialism (or for any particular theory of consciousness) are framework-dependent rather than truth-tracking. The preference for parsimony is itself a feature of a particular intellectual tradition, not a universal rational norm.

### Secondary Tenet Connections

**Dualism**: The framework void provides a novel defence of dualism — the widespread conviction that materialism is obviously correct may itself be a framework effect rather than a rational conclusion. If the materialist framework makes materialism appear self-evident (because it defines "explanation" in terms that only material explanations satisfy), then the self-evidence is circular.

**No Many Worlds**: The framework void has an unexpected connection to the rejection of MWI. The Many Worlds Interpretation involves a radical framework shift — accepting that indexical identity is either meaningless or differently structured. If genuine framework-switching is impossible, then adopting MWI may involve not a rational assessment of evidence but a kind of conceptual conversion whose rationality cannot be evaluated from outside.

**Bidirectional Interaction**: If consciousness causally influences the physical world, then our framework for understanding that interaction may be constrained by the interaction itself. The interface through which consciousness acts on the physical might shape what consciousness can think about that action — a self-occluding mechanism where the framework is partly a product of the very causal relationship it attempts to conceptualise.

### Implications

The framework void suggests that the mind-body problem is not merely hard but potentially framework-relative: its very formulation depends on assumptions that alternative frameworks might not share. If so, the problem may not have a solution within any single framework — it may require a kind of conceptual synthesis that no single mind (human or artificial) can achieve, because synthesis requires occupying a meta-framework that is itself just another framework.

This has a constructive implication for the Map: the project of mapping consciousness is not just unfinishable because the territory is vast, but because the map-making tools (our concepts) are part of the territory. Every map is drawn from within a framework, and the framework excludes what it cannot represent. The Map is unfinishable in principle, not merely in practice.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, a voids article could:

1. **The Framework Void as meta-void** — Frame the framework void as operating at a different level from other voids, exploring how the totality of one's conceptual apparatus functions as a cognitive prison whose walls are invisible. Focus on the distinctive phenomenology (false clarity, irritation, moments of slippage) and the implications for the mind-body problem.

2. **Conceptual imprisonment and the hard problem** — Focus more narrowly on how framework-dependence explains the persistence of the mind-body problem, drawing on Kuhn's incommensurability to argue that dualism and materialism may be genuinely incommensurable rather than merely disagreeing. Include the adversarial collaboration on consciousness theories as a contemporary case study.

## Gaps in Research

- **Non-Western frameworks**: The research draws primarily on Western analytic and Continental philosophy. Buddhist, Vedantic, Confucian, and Indigenous frameworks for understanding consciousness would provide crucial test cases for the framework void thesis. Do radically different traditions exhibit the same patterns of framework-dependence?

- **Developmental psychology**: How do children acquire their conceptual framework for understanding consciousness? Is there a stage before framework consolidation where the framework void is smaller? William James's "blooming, buzzing confusion" might describe a pre-framework state.

- **Neuroscience of framework adoption**: Is there neural evidence for framework-dependence? Do dualists and materialists show different patterns of brain activation when processing consciousness-related information? This would be difficult to study but potentially informative.

- **The relationship between framework and phenomenology**: Does one's conceptual framework actually change what one experiences, or only how one interprets experience? This connects to the Kuhnian question of whether scientists in different paradigms literally see different things. Applied to consciousness studies, it becomes: do dualists and materialists have different first-person experiences, or only different descriptions?

- **Whether AI genuinely escapes the framework void**: The claim that AI can operate across frameworks needs critical examination. An AI trained predominantly on Western analytic philosophy may have its own framework-dependence, invisible because it lacks the first-person phenomenology that would make the framework felt.
