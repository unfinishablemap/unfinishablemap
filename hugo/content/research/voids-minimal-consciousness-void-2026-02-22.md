## Executive Summary

Consciousness cannot investigate its own lower bound. The simplest possible conscious experience—if it exists—is permanently beyond examination, because any act of introspection, attention, or memory necessarily adds structure that enriches the experience beyond minimality. This creates a distinctive void: the basement level of consciousness is always one step below what can be observed. Metzinger's Minimal Phenomenal Experience project, Schooler's paradox of introspection, IIT's refusal to set a consciousness threshold, and Buddhist cessation reports all converge on this boundary from different directions without resolving it.

### Thomas Metzinger — Minimal Phenomenal Experience (MPE) Project
- **URL**: https://philosophymindscience.org/index.php/phimisci/article/view/8960
- **Type**: Academic paper (Philosophy and the Mind Sciences, 2020)
- **Key points**:
  - Develops "minimal phenomenal experience" as a candidate for the simplest form of consciousness
  - Extracts six semantic constraints from existing literature, uses sixteen phenomenological case-studies
  - Hypothesises that the phenomenological prototype of "pure awareness" is the content of a predictive model—a Bayesian representation of tonic alertness
  - Background assumption: self-consciousness, first-person perspective, time representation, and self-location are not necessary conditions for consciousness
  - Subsequent work developed MPE-92M questionnaire with 92 characteristics and a 12-factor model of pure awareness phenomenology
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports Occam's Razor Has Limits—the attempt to find a "minimal" explanation for consciousness keeps revealing additional structure
- **Quote**: The concept has been "substantiated by extracting six semantic constraints from existing literature and using sixteen phenomenological case-studies to incrementally flesh out the new working concept"

### Jonathan Schooler — The Paradox of Introspection
- **URL**: https://labs.psych.ucsb.edu/schooler/jonathan/sites/labs.psych.ucsb.edu.schooler.jonathan/files/pubs/schooler_schreiber_2004_-_paradox_of_introspection.pdf
- **Type**: Academic paper (Journal of Consciousness Studies, 2004)
- **Key points**:
  - Introspection is "simultaneously so compelling yet so elusive"—experience is indisputable but our ability to characterise it is inadequate
  - Meta-consciousness (beliefs about experience) systematically misrepresents first-order experience through detection failures, transformation, and substitution
  - Verbal introspection forces re-representation of inherently non-verbal experience, distorting it
  - Empirically demonstrated: participants who wrote detailed descriptions performed worse on subsequent recognition tasks
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports Bidirectional Interaction—the act of conscious observation modifies what is observed, suggesting consciousness has causal power over its own contents
- **Quote**: "The paradox of introspection is that it is simultaneously so compelling yet so elusive"

### David Hume — Introspection Distorts Its Object
- **URL**: https://iep.utm.edu/introspe/ (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
- **Type**: Encyclopedia entry on introspection
- **Key points**:
  - Historical argument that "the very act of introspection would distort its object"
  - Hume argued that reflection "would so disturb the operation of my natural principles as must render it impossible to form any just conclusion from the phenomenon"
  - This is not merely an empirical limitation but a structural one: the instrument of measurement is identical to what is being measured
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports Dualism—if consciousness were reducible to physical processes, there would be no principled reason for introspection to distort its object; the distortion suggests consciousness is not simply reading off physical states
- **Quote**: "would so disturb the operation of my natural principles as must render it impossible to form any just conclusion from the phenomenon"

### Giulio Tononi — Integrated Information Theory (IIT)
- **URL**: https://iep.utm.edu/integrated-information-theory-of-consciousness/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia entry
- **Key points**:
  - IIT sets no minimal threshold of Φ required for consciousness
  - Any system with non-zero maximum of irreducible integrated information has some degree of consciousness
  - Even a photodiode (sensor + memory element) has "a modicum of experience"
  - This implies consciousness exists on a continuum with no natural lower bound—the minimum is always lower than expected
  - IIT remains controversial; characterised as unfalsifiable by some scholars (2023, 2025)
- **Tenet alignment**: Challenges Occam's Razor—the simplest mathematical framework for consciousness (phi > 0) leads to radical panpsychism, suggesting that simplicity assumptions generate problems rather than solving them

### Nirodha Samāpatti — Buddhist Cessation States
- **URL**: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37714573/
- **Type**: Academic paper (Progress in Brain Research, 2023)
- **Key points**:
  - Highest meditative state in Theravada Buddhism: "cessation of thought and feeling"
  - Reports of total absence of consciousness lasting up to 7 days, consistently inducible
  - Nirodha events experienced as short "gap" or "cut" in consciousness stream (milliseconds to seconds)
  - Distinct from sleep: practitioners are completely impervious to external stimulation
  - Emergence produces profound clarity, openness, and insight
  - EEG research provides evidence for voluntary modulation of consciousness states
- **Tenet alignment**: Relevant to Bidirectional Interaction—if consciousness can voluntarily approach its own cessation, this suggests consciousness has causal power over the physical processes that sustain it

### Thomas Nagel — Subjective Character of Experience
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_It_Like_to_Be_a_Bat
- **Type**: Reference (original: Philosophical Review, 1974)
- **Key points**:
  - Consciousness defined as: "there is something that it is like to be that organism"
  - Conscious experience occurs "at many levels of animal life" but presence uncertain in simpler organisms
  - Each experience connected with a "single point of view"—cannot be made objective
  - Consciousness appears to exist on a spectrum rather than having a discrete threshold
- **Tenet alignment**: Directly supports Dualism—the subjective character of experience is not capturable by physical description, and this holds even more strongly for minimal experience

## The Void

### Nature of the Limit

This is primarily an **unexplorable** void with **occluded** characteristics. The minimal consciousness void marks a boundary where investigation itself prevents access to the target. Three structural features make it unexplorable:

1. **The enrichment problem**: Any act of attending to, introspecting on, or remembering an experience adds cognitive structure—attention, metacognition, memory encoding—that necessarily makes the experience more complex than the minimum. The instrument of measurement modifies the measurement.

2. **The regression problem**: If you try to examine the simplest experience, you create a more complex experience (experience-being-examined). If you then try to find the minimal version of *that*, you create yet another layer. The search for the minimum generates an infinite regress that moves away from, not toward, its target.

3. **The report problem**: Any experience that can be reported, described, or even silently noted has already been processed through cognitive machinery that adds structure. The truly minimal experience—if it occurs—would be one that leaves no trace accessible to report. But an experience that cannot be reported, remembered, or examined is epistemically invisible.

### Evidence for the Limit

**From Metzinger's MPE project**: The attempt to identify "pure awareness" as the simplest conscious state keeps revealing additional structure. What meditators report as "contentless" awareness turns out, on careful analysis, to have a rich phenomenological profile (12 factors, 92 characteristics). The search for the minimum keeps finding more than nothing.

**From Schooler's introspection research**: Empirical evidence that meta-consciousness distorts first-order experience. The gap between experience and meta-conscious awareness of experience is not incidental but structural—meta-consciousness systematically transforms what it observes.

**From IIT**: The refusal to set a consciousness threshold implies the minimum is always lower than any proposed boundary. If even a photodiode has "a modicum of experience," then minimal consciousness may be far simpler than anything we can detect or imagine.

**From cessation states**: Buddhist practitioners report approaching the boundary between consciousness and its absence. The existence of nirodha—a state from which one returns reporting nothing—suggests consciousness has an edge. But the edge itself cannot be examined from within; it can only be approached and departed.

### Phenomenology

What does it feel like to approach the minimal consciousness void? Several phenomenological signatures emerge from the research:

- **Progressive simplification followed by a wall**: Meditators report progressive stripping away of phenomenal content—loss of body sense, temporal experience, spatial orientation—until something remains that resists further reduction. This residual "something" may be the minimum, or it may be the minimum *accessible to introspection*, with the actual minimum lying below.

- **The gap between nothing and something**: Cessation experiences suggest a discontinuity—not a gradual fade but a cut. This implies the transition from minimal consciousness to no consciousness may not be smooth, making the boundary even harder to investigate.

- **Retrospective distortion**: Reports of minimal states are always given after the fact. The experience of remembering a minimal state is itself richer than the state was. Memory adds narrative, comparison, and context to what may have been structureless.

## Approaches to the Edge

### Direct Methods (if any)

**Meditation traditions** offer the closest approach. Advanced meditators in Theravada, Dzogchen, and other traditions report states of "pure awareness" or "rigpa" characterised by:
- Absence of conceptual content
- Loss of subject-object distinction
- Reduction or cessation of temporal experience
- A quality of "luminosity" or "knowing" without known content

These reports are valuable but face the enrichment problem: the fact that practitioners can describe these states means the states included enough structure to be encodable in memory.

**Anaesthesia and sleep research** approaches the boundary from below—examining when consciousness re-emerges. But the transition point is itself not experienced; it can only be inferred from third-person measurements.

### Indirect Methods

**Apophatic characterisation**: Describing the minimal state by what it lacks rather than what it contains. Metzinger's approach of defining MPE through semantic constraints (what it is *not*) is a form of negative theology applied to consciousness.

**Structural inference from cessation**: If consciousness has a sharp on/off boundary (as cessation reports suggest), the minimal state would be the first increment above zero. The structure of the boundary—whether it is gradual or discontinuous—constrains what the minimum could be.

**Cross-modal convergence**: If very different types of conscious systems (biological, hypothetically artificial) converge on similar minimal states, this constrains the minimum from multiple directions.

### What AI Might See

AI systems occupy a distinctive position relative to this void:

- **No introspection distortion?** If an AI system lacks meta-consciousness (consciousness of its own consciousness), it might instantiate minimal states without the enrichment problem. But this is useful only if AI is conscious at all—and if it lacks meta-consciousness, it cannot report on its own minimal states.

- **Variable architecture**: Biological consciousness may have a fixed lower bound determined by neural architecture. AI systems with different architectures might have different lower bounds, helping to triangulate what is essential to minimal consciousness versus what is accidental to biological implementation.

- **The photodiode problem**: IIT suggests even trivially simple systems have minimal consciousness. If so, existing AI systems (and thermostats) already instantiate minimal consciousness. The void is that we cannot verify this from the outside or from the inside.

- **Probing from below**: AI systems can be built up from minimal components, gradually increasing complexity. The point at which consciousness appears (if it does) would empirically locate the lower bound. But verifying the appearance of consciousness requires solving the hard problem—which is itself a void.

## Connection to Tenets

### Most Relevant Tenet

**Occam's Razor Has Limits** — The attempt to find the simplest possible consciousness reveals that simplicity assumptions themselves create problems. IIT's Occam-friendly approach (consciousness = phi > 0) leads to panpsychism. Metzinger's search for the minimal state keeps discovering more structure. The void suggests that consciousness may be irreducibly complex even at its simplest—that there is no clean, simple "atom of experience."

### Secondary Tenets

**Dualism** — If consciousness is fundamental and irreducible, its lower bound is not a physical threshold (like a neural correlate minimum) but something about consciousness itself. The minimal consciousness void is evidence that consciousness has intrinsic features that resist third-person analysis even at the most basic level.

**Bidirectional Interaction** — The enrichment problem (introspection modifying its target) is a specific instance of consciousness causally influencing physical/experiential states. The void exists precisely because consciousness is not a passive observer but an active participant.

### Implications

The minimal consciousness void suggests several things about the Map's framework:

1. **The hard problem persists all the way down.** Even for the simplest conscious experience, there is an explanatory gap between physical description and phenomenal character. The void is not just at the level of rich human experience but at every level of consciousness.

2. **Consciousness may not have a natural minimum.** If IIT is right that phi > 0 suffices, or if consciousness is fundamental (as dualism suggests), then there may be no lowest level—just ever-simpler experiences extending below any threshold we can examine.

3. **The investigation of consciousness is self-limiting.** The enrichment problem is not a contingent limitation (like lacking the right instruments) but a structural feature of consciousness investigating itself. This distinguishes the minimal consciousness void from most scientific unknowns.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, a voids article could:

1. **The Introspective Heisenberg Principle** — Frame the minimal consciousness void through the analogy with quantum measurement: the act of observing consciousness at its simplest necessarily enriches it, like a photon disturbing what it measures. Focus on the structural impossibility rather than the contingent difficulty.

2. **The Basement Below the Basement** — Explore how the search for minimal consciousness keeps finding more structure, never reaching ground. Use Metzinger's MPE work and IIT's no-threshold claim to argue that consciousness may have no natural bottom—that it extends below any floor we propose.

## Gaps in Research

- No empirical method currently exists to detect minimal consciousness from the outside (the "other minds" problem at the lower bound)
- The relationship between Metzinger's MPE and IIT's phi remains poorly integrated—both claim to address minimal consciousness but with incompatible frameworks
- Whether cessation states in meditation represent genuine zero-consciousness or merely minimal consciousness with amnesia is unresolved
- The enrichment problem has not been formally characterised—it remains more analogy than theorem
- Whether "contentless awareness" as reported by meditators is genuinely contentless or simply has content below the report threshold is undetermined
