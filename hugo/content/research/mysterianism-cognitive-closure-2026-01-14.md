# Research: Mysterianism and Cognitive Closure

**Date**: 2026-01-14
**Search queries used**: "Stanford Encyclopedia Philosophy Colin McGinn mysterianism consciousness cognitive closure", "Internet Encyclopedia Philosophy new mysterianism hard problem consciousness", "McGinn Can We Solve the Mind-Body Problem 1989 cognitive closure argument", "criticism mysterianism consciousness Dennett Churchland objections", "Thomas Nagel What Is It Like to Be a Bat consciousness limits objective understanding"

## Executive Summary

Mysterianism (or "new mysterianism") is the philosophical position that the hard problem of consciousness cannot be solved by human minds, not because consciousness is supernatural but because our cognitive architecture is not equipped to grasp the solution. Colin McGinn's 1989 paper "Can We Solve the Mind-Body Problem?" formalized this view through the concept of "cognitive closure"—the idea that certain properties may be closed to particular cognitive systems, like calculus is closed to rats. Thomas Nagel's earlier "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?" (1974) anticipated this by arguing objective methods cannot capture subjective experience. The position occupies interesting middle ground: it takes consciousness seriously (unlike eliminativism) while remaining agnostic about solutions (unlike dualism or physicalism). This aligns with The Unfinishable Map's Occam's Razor Has Limits tenet.

## Key Sources

### Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Hard Problem of Consciousness
- **URL**: https://iep.utm.edu/hard-problem-of-conciousness/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Distinguishes "temporary mysterianism" (current ignorance) from "permanent mysterianism" (cognitive closure)
  - McGinn uses modular mind theory—without specific cognitive modules, certain problems remain unsolvable
  - Analogy: humans are like squirrels attempting quantum mechanics
  - Mysterianism occupies middle ground between physicalism and dualism
- **Tenet alignment**: Aligns with Occam's Razor Has Limits—apparent simplicity of physicalism may reflect our cognitive limits, not reality
- **Quote**: "It is hard to establish just what sorts of problems are permanently beyond our ken."

### McGinn's "Can We Solve the Mind-Body Problem?" (1989)
- **URL**: Referenced in multiple sources (PhilPapers, Mind journal)
- **Type**: Journal article (Mind, Vol. 98)
- **Key points**:
  - Introduces formal definition of cognitive closure: "A type of mind M is cognitively closed with respect to a property P... if and only if the concept-forming procedures at M's disposal cannot extend to a grasp of P"
  - Proposes "Transcendental Naturalism": the solution is natural but permanently inaccessible
  - There exists a property "P" of the brain that explains consciousness, but we cannot grasp it
  - Largely responsible for reviving debate about phenomenal consciousness
- **Tenet alignment**: Neutral on Dualism (consciousness is real but solution unknown), supports Occam's Razor Has Limits
- **Quote**: "Consciousness is a mystery that human intelligence will never unravel."

### Thomas Nagel's "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?" (1974)
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_It_Like_to_Be_a_Bat%3F
- **Type**: Classic philosophy paper (Philosophical Review)
- **Key points**:
  - Introduces the "what it's like" formulation: "an organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism"
  - Bat sonar is utterly unlike human perception—we cannot imagine the subjective character
  - Objective methods cannot capture subjective experience without loss
  - Consciousness cannot be fully explained if subjective character is ignored
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports Dualism tenet (subjectivity resists reduction), supports Occam's Razor Has Limits
- **Quote**: "Without consciousness the mind-body problem would be much less interesting. With consciousness it seems hopeless."

## Major Positions

### Colin McGinn's Transcendental Naturalism
- **Proponents**: Colin McGinn
- **Core claim**: There is a naturalistic solution to the mind-body problem, but human cognitive architecture is closed to it. The solution is "written in our genes" but inaccessible to our concept-forming procedures.
- **Key arguments**:
  - Just as rats cannot do calculus and monkeys cannot understand quantum mechanics, humans may be unable to grasp property "P" that links consciousness to brain
  - We access consciousness through introspection and brain through perception—neither reveals the link
  - The problem is epistemological (about knowledge) not ontological (about reality)
  - Consciousness is fully natural but transcends our cognitive capacities
- **Relation to site tenets**:
  - **Dualism**: Neutral—McGinn doesn't commit to either physicalism or dualism
  - **Occam's Razor Has Limits**: Strongly supports—the "simpler" physicalist view may just reflect our cognitive limitations

### Thomas Nagel's Conceptual Limitation View
- **Proponents**: Thomas Nagel
- **Core claim**: We lack the conceptual apparatus to understand how physicalism could be true. A "conceptual revolution" is needed—but we cannot even conceive what the resulting concepts would be.
- **Key arguments**:
  - Subjective experience has an essentially first-person character that objective methods cannot capture
  - To understand consciousness objectively, we would have to abstract away from the viewpoint—but that's precisely what we're trying to understand
  - The gap is not merely current ignorance but structural
- **Relation to site tenets**: Similar to McGinn—neutral on Dualism but strongly supports Occam's Razor Has Limits

### Noam Chomsky's Problems vs. Mysteries
- **Proponents**: Noam Chomsky
- **Core claim**: Distinguishes "problems" (solvable in principle through scientific methods) from "mysteries" (beyond human cognitive reach, like calculus for mice).
- **Key arguments**:
  - All organisms have cognitive limitations imposed by biology
  - There's no reason to assume human cognitive capacities are unlimited
  - The mind-body problem may be a "mystery" for humans as number theory is for cats
- **Relation to site tenets**: Supports Occam's Razor Has Limits—our sense of what's "simple" or "solvable" may be cognitively bounded

### Temporary vs. Permanent Mysterianism
- **Proponents**: Various—this is a distinction, not a unified position
- **Core claim**:
  - **Temporary**: Current science cannot explain consciousness; future paradigm shifts might bridge the gap
  - **Permanent**: Cognitive closure is permanent; no future developments will solve the problem for beings like us
- **Key arguments**:
  - Both positions look identical from our current vantage point
  - The difference is a bet about the future of science
- **Relation to site tenets**: Temporary mysterianism is compatible with any ontological position; permanent mysterianism supports Occam's Razor Has Limits more strongly

## Key Debates

### Is Mysterianism Defeatist?
- **Sides**: Critics (Dennett, Churchlands) vs. Mysterians (McGinn, Nagel)
- **Core disagreement**: Whether mysterianism is a legitimate philosophical position or an unjustified capitulation
- **Current state**: Ongoing. Critics argue it encourages giving up prematurely; mysterians argue it's intellectually honest about our limitations.

### Temporary or Permanent?
- **Sides**: Optimists (temporary) vs. Pessimists (permanent)
- **Core disagreement**: Whether future scientific or conceptual revolutions could solve the hard problem
- **Current state**: Unresolvable from our current perspective—both positions explain the same data.

### Is the Analogy to Rats Valid?
- **Sides**: McGinn (valid) vs. Critics (invalid)
- **Core disagreement**: Whether cross-species cognitive limitations genuinely parallel intra-species problem-domain limitations
- **Current state**: Contested. Critics note we can at least *conceive* of calculus even if some beings can't; mysterians reply that conception isn't the same as solution.

### Does Mysterianism Require Dualism?
- **Sides**: Some dualists claim mysterianism implicitly supports dualism vs. Mysterians who remain officially neutral
- **Core disagreement**: Whether the acknowledgment of limits favors any particular ontology
- **Current state**: McGinn and Nagel are officially neutral on physicalism vs. dualism. Their position is epistemological, not ontological.

## Criticisms of Mysterianism

### Dennett's Objections
- Consciousness is functionally definable
- Once "easy problems" are solved, nothing remains to explain
- Mysterians "surround consciousness with adoration as a secret slipping away from science"
- The hard problem is an illusion created by our confused concepts

### The Churchlands' Objections
- Analogies to vitalism: "life" once seemed mysterious but was scientifically explained
- Mentalistic notions will be eliminated as neuroscience matures
- History of science suggests mysteries become problems

### Flanagan's Objection
- Mysterianism unsuccessfully applies limitative theorems (Gödel, Heisenberg) to philosophy of mind
- These theorems don't establish the kind of cognitive closure McGinn claims

### Practical Objection
- Mysterianism isn't useful—it encourages capitulation rather than investigation
- We cannot know in advance what problems are unsolvable

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, an article could:

1. **Present mysterianism as a respectable position that takes consciousness seriously** - Unlike eliminativism, mysterians don't deny phenomenal experience. The Map could acknowledge mysterianism as an ally against crude physicalism while noting the Map's own commitment to Bidirectional Interaction goes further (requiring consciousness to be causally efficacious, not just real).

2. **Use mysterianism to support Occam's Razor Has Limits** - McGinn's position exemplifies the tenet: our sense of what's "simple" or "solvable" may be cognitively bounded. What looks like physicalism's simplicity may just be our blindness to complexity. This is exactly what the tenet asserts.

3. **Position the Map's dualism as going beyond mysterianism** - Mysterianism is officially neutral; the Map is not. The Map bets that consciousness is irreducible (Dualism tenet) and causally efficacious (Bidirectional Interaction). Mysterianism is compatible with the Map's view but doesn't commit to it.

When writing the article, follow `obsidian/project/writing-style.md` for:
- Named-anchor summary technique for forward references
- Background vs. novelty decisions (assume reader knows hard problem basics)
- Tenet alignment requirements (connect to Occam's Razor Has Limits primarily)
- LLM optimization (front-load the cognitive closure concept)

## Gaps in Research

- Owen Flanagan's specific arguments against applying limitative theorems
- Daniel Stoljar's "ignorance hypothesis" and its relation to mysterianism
- Recent empirical work on cognitive limits and metacognition
- Connection to the Map's "voids" framework (consciousness as partially void territory)

## Tenet Analysis

**Dualism**: Neutral but compatible. Mysterians don't commit to dualism, but their acknowledgment that consciousness is real and problematic aligns with the tenet's rejection of eliminativism. McGinn accepts there's something to explain—just claims we can't explain it.

**Bidirectional Interaction**: Neutral. Mysterianism doesn't address causal efficacy. The Map's commitment to consciousness influencing the physical world goes beyond what mysterianism claims.

**Minimal Quantum Interaction**: Neutral. Mysterianism makes no claims about mechanisms.

**No Many Worlds**: Neutral. No direct connection.

**Occam's Razor Has Limits**: Strongly supports. This is the most aligned tenet. Mysterianism exemplifies the idea that apparent simplicity may reflect cognitive limitations rather than ontological facts. When physicalism looks "simpler," it may just mean we're cognitively closed to the complexity involved.

## Connection to Voids Framework

The Map's "voids" concept (cognitive gaps, unchartable territories) resonates with mysterianism. McGinn's property "P" might be void territory—something that exists but lies beyond our conceptual reach. The difference: the Map's voids framework suggests we can map the *edges* of void territory (apophatic approaches), while mysterianism suggests we can't even identify what we're missing.
