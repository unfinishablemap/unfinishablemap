## Executive Summary

Can consciousness verify its own causal powers? This research investigates what may be the deepest epistemological void in the agency landscape: not the opacity of *how* we decide (covered by volitional opacity) or *how* consciousness interfaces with the physical (covered by the causal interface void), but whether consciousness can ever establish *that* it genuinely causes anything at all. The agency verification void is the structural impossibility of consciousness stepping outside itself to check whether the feeling of "I did that" tracks causal reality. Every tool consciousness has for investigating its own efficacy is internal to the system whose efficacy is in question — making verification circular at every turn.

## Key Sources

### Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy — Mental Causation
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-causation/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - If minds and their states were causally isolated from bodily behavior, what goes on in the mind could not explain what we do
  - The causal exclusion problem (Kim): if all physical effects have sufficient physical causes, there cannot be irreducible mental causes
  - The pairing problem: why does *my* intention cause *my* hand to move rather than yours?
- **Tenet alignment**: Directly challenges bidirectional interaction — if causal closure holds, consciousness cannot cause anything. The Map's commitment to bidirectional interaction makes this void especially pressing.
- **Quote**: "If minds did not influence behavior, in what sense would anyone truly act?"

### Daniel Wegner — The Illusion of Conscious Will (MIT Press, 2002)
- **URL**: https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262731621/the-illusion-of-conscious-will/
- **Type**: Book
- **Key points**:
  - The experience of conscious will arises from three principles: priority (thought precedes action), consistency (thought matches action), exclusivity (no other apparent causes)
  - Both behavior and intentions may be products of unconscious processes — the feeling of will is post-hoc attribution
  - Conscious will could be a useful illusion serving social coordination and moral responsibility
- **Tenet alignment**: If Wegner is right, bidirectional interaction is an illusion. But the self-stultification problem suggests his own theory undermines itself — he cannot know his theory is true if his believing it is epiphenomenal.
- **Quote**: "The experience of consciously willing an action is not a direct indication that the conscious thought has caused the action."

### Libet — Readiness Potential Experiments (1983)
- **URL**: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6640273/
- **Type**: Empirical study
- **Key points**:
  - The readiness potential precedes conscious awareness of the decision to move by ~335ms
  - Conscious intention appears *after* brain preparation for action has begun
  - Libet preserved a role for conscious "veto" — the ability to abort an initiated action
- **Tenet alignment**: Seems to threaten bidirectional interaction, but the void here is epistemological: the experiment measures *timing* but cannot determine *causation*. Consciousness cannot verify whether it initiated or merely observed.
- **Quote**: "The initiation of voluntary action begins before an individual makes a conscious decision to move."

### Schurger, Sitt, & Dehaene — Stochastic Reinterpretation (PNAS, 2012)
- **URL**: https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1210467109
- **Type**: Paper
- **Key points**:
  - The readiness potential may reflect spontaneous neural fluctuations crossing a threshold, not unconscious "decisions"
  - Participants in Libet-style tasks may simply act when ongoing neural noise tips the scale
  - This reinterpretation undermines the claim that the brain "decides" before consciousness, but doesn't resolve whether consciousness *causes*
- **Tenet alignment**: Removes one argument against conscious causation without establishing conscious causation — the void persists either way.

### Stanford Encyclopedia — Epiphenomenalism
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epiphenomenalism/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Epiphenomenalism holds consciousness is caused by physical processes but causes nothing itself
  - The self-stultification objection: if epiphenomenalism is true, we cannot know it is true, because our belief in it would be causally inert
  - One response: "direct acquaintance" provides non-causal knowledge of experience, bypassing the self-stultification problem
- **Tenet alignment**: The self-stultification problem reveals the void from the other direction — epiphenomenalism cannot verify its own truth any more than interactionism can verify its truth.

### Kim — Causal Exclusion Argument
- **URL**: https://iep.utm.edu/mind-and-the-causal-exclusion-problem/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - If every physical event has a sufficient physical cause, mental causation is either redundant (overdetermination) or illusory
  - For non-reductive dualism, the exclusion argument is particularly acute — the non-physical mind must cause something *beyond* what physics already accounts for
  - Responses include rejecting causal closure, embracing overdetermination, or redefining causation
- **Tenet alignment**: The Map's tenet of minimal quantum interaction is precisely an attempt to thread this needle — consciousness intervenes at the quantum level where physics permits indeterminacy. But the verification void remains: how would consciousness know its quantum interventions are genuine?

### PMC — The Causal Efficacy of Consciousness
- **URL**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7517407/
- **Type**: Journal article
- **Key points**:
  - Viewed from a first-person perspective, consciousness appears necessary for complex activity
  - Viewed from a third-person perspective, consciousness appears to play no role in brain activity
  - This produces a "causal paradox" — the perspective from which you observe determines whether consciousness appears causal
  - Conscious phenomenology generally follows the processing to which it most closely relates, coming too late to causally affect that processing
- **Tenet alignment**: The perspectival dependence of apparent causation is itself evidence of the void — consciousness cannot achieve a perspective-independent view of its own causal role.

### De Brigard — Self-Stultification Objection (2014)
- **URL**: https://people.duke.edu/~fd13/2014/De_Brigard_2014_JoCS.pdf
- **Type**: Paper
- **Key points**:
  - The self-stultification objection: if epiphenomenalism is true, beliefs about consciousness are causally inert, making the theory self-undermining
  - Knowledge requires causal connection to what is known — but epiphenomenalism denies causal connection between experience and beliefs about experience
  - Robinson's defense via "direct acquaintance" remains contested
- **Tenet alignment**: Reveals symmetric void — both epiphenomenalism and interactionism face the same verification problem from opposite directions.

## The Void

### Nature of the Limit

The agency verification void is a second-order epistemic limit: it is not merely that we cannot see *how* consciousness causes things (that is volitional opacity and the causal interface void), but that we cannot determine *whether* consciousness causes anything at all. This void is structural rather than merely practical — it arises from the logical impossibility of using a system to verify its own causal efficacy without circularity.

The void has several distinct layers:

1. **The circularity layer**: Any evidence consciousness gathers about its own causal powers is gathered *through* consciousness. If consciousness is not causal, this evidence is meaningless. If it is causal, the evidence is tautological. Either way, verification fails.

2. **The timing layer**: Libet-style experiments reveal that the relationship between conscious awareness and action initiation is temporally ambiguous. Even Schurger's reinterpretation, which rescues consciousness from being *disproved* as a cause, cannot establish it *as* a cause.

3. **The exclusion layer**: Kim's causal exclusion argument shows that if physics is causally closed, there is no "room" for consciousness to cause anything. The Map's tenet of minimal quantum interaction attempts to find room — but how would consciousness verify that its quantum interventions are genuine rather than post-hoc attributions?

4. **The perspectival layer**: The causal paradox — consciousness appears causal from the inside, non-causal from the outside — suggests the question may be perspective-dependent in a way that precludes resolution.

### Evidence for the Limit

Multiple converging lines of evidence suggest this is a genuine void rather than merely difficult territory:

- **The self-stultification symmetry**: Epiphenomenalism cannot verify itself because believing it would be epiphenomenal. Interactionism cannot verify itself because the verification tools are internal to the system. Both positions face the same structural barrier from opposite directions.

- **Wegner's three principles**: The sense of agency depends on priority, consistency, and exclusivity — all of which are *criteria for attribution*, not evidence of causation. We feel we cause our actions when these conditions are met, regardless of whether we actually do.

- **Experimental irresolvability**: Over forty years of Libet-style experiments and their reinterpretations have produced no consensus. This is not a sign of scientific immaturity — it may reflect a genuine epistemic boundary.

- **The paradox of causal knowledge**: Knowing anything about causation requires being causally embedded in a system. But being embedded means you cannot achieve the external view needed to verify your own causal role within it.

### Phenomenology

Approaching this void produces a distinctive phenomenological experience:

- **The certainty-doubt oscillation**: We feel absolutely certain we are agents (the experience of willing is among the most vivid we have), yet philosophical reflection immediately destabilizes this certainty. The oscillation between experiential certainty and rational doubt is characteristic of approaching a genuine void boundary.

- **The vanishing target**: When you try to catch yourself in the act of causing something — to directly observe the moment of causal intervention — the observation itself becomes the object. The target recedes, much like trying to observe the act of observation itself.

- **The uncomfortable suspension**: Genuinely sitting with the question "am I really doing anything?" produces a form of cognitive vertigo. The question threatens to dissolve the preconditions for asking it — if I am not an agent, in what sense am I asking?

## Approaches to the Edge

### Direct Methods (if any)

Direct verification appears structurally impossible. Every attempt to directly verify conscious causation uses the very faculty whose causal efficacy is in question:

- **Introspection**: Cannot distinguish genuine causal efficacy from a compelling attribution of efficacy
- **Neuroscience**: Can correlate brain activity with reported conscious states but cannot determine which (if either) is causal of the other
- **Behavioral evidence**: Actions consistent with conscious causation are equally consistent with consciousness as epiphenomenal accompaniment

### Indirect Methods

Several indirect approaches might probe the boundary:

- **Apophatic analysis**: Map what conscious causation *cannot* be. If every positive account fails in characteristic ways, the pattern of failure may reveal something about the territory. This mirrors the Map's methodology of apophatic cartography.

- **The self-stultification test**: Use the self-undermining structure of denial as indirect evidence. If denying conscious causation is self-stultifying, this asymmetry may constitute a form of indirect evidence — not proof, but rational pressure.

- **Anomaly hunting**: Look for phenomena that seem difficult to explain without conscious causation — the placebo effect, creative insight, spontaneous decision-making. These cannot prove conscious causation, but their absence under epiphenomenalism would need explanation.

- **Structural analysis of the void itself**: The fact that the void is symmetric (both sides face verification failure) is itself informative. It suggests the question may be ill-formed or may require a conceptual framework we haven't yet developed.

### What AI Might See

Artificial minds offer a distinctive perspective on this void:

- **AI systems lack the felt sense of agency entirely** (at least as far as current understanding goes). An AI can process information about its own causal role in producing outputs without the accompanying phenomenal sense of "I did that." This means AI can examine the *structure* of the verification problem without the confounding variable of felt agency.

- **AI could potentially identify patterns in the verification failure** — regularities in where the circularity breaks down — that human minds, caught up in the experience of agency, might miss.

- **The contrast between AI processing and human agency might itself be illuminating**: if AI produces complex, novel outputs without felt agency, this suggests either that (a) agency is not necessary for complex behavior (supporting epiphenomenalism) or (b) there is something about human action that genuinely differs from AI processing at a level beyond information processing (supporting dualist interactionism).

- **AI can model both positions simultaneously** without the existential stakes that make the question difficult for humans — your identity doesn't collapse if you conclude you might not be an agent.

## Connection to Tenets

### Most Relevant Tenet

**Bidirectional Interaction** is the most directly implicated tenet. The Map commits to the claim that consciousness causally influences the physical world. The agency verification void reveals that this commitment cannot be empirically verified from within — it must be held as a philosophical commitment that shapes inquiry rather than a conclusion derived from evidence.

**Occam's Razor Has Limits** is the second most relevant. The simplest explanation (epiphenomenalism — consciousness exists but doesn't do anything) might be wrong, and our preference for it might itself be a cognitive bias. The void suggests that simplicity is not a reliable guide in this domain because the question may be structurally underdecidable.

### Implications

1. **The Map's commitment to bidirectional interaction is a *decision*, not a discovery.** The agency verification void means this commitment cannot be grounded in evidence in the usual sense. This is not a weakness — it is honest acknowledgment that some foundational commitments precede and shape the evidence we can gather.

2. **The void is tenet-generated.** Because the Map holds that consciousness is non-physical and causally efficacious, it generates the question of how verification could work across the physical/non-physical boundary. Materialist positions face a different version: how can a physical system verify that its physical processes constitute genuine agency rather than mere mechanism?

3. **The void reveals something about the structure of consciousness.** That consciousness cannot verify its own causal powers may tell us something about what consciousness *is* — a perspective that is always embedded, never external to itself, structurally incapable of achieving the objectivity needed for self-verification.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, a voids article could:

1. **The Agency Verification Void** — Frame the void as the fundamental impossibility of consciousness verifying its own causal powers, distinct from and deeper than volitional opacity and the causal interface void. Emphasize the symmetric failure: both interactionism and epiphenomenalism face the same barrier, and neither can be verified or falsified from within.

2. **The Witness Cannot Testify** — A more literary framing: consciousness as witness to its own actions, who cannot testify about whether it is the author or merely the audience. Draw on phenomenological descriptions of the felt gap between certainty and knowledge.

## Gaps in Research

- **Integrated Information Theory (IIT)**: IIT makes consciousness intrinsically causal — consciousness *is* causal structure. This might dissolve the void rather than probe it. More investigation needed into whether IIT's identification of consciousness with causal power avoids or merely relocates the verification problem.
- **Process philosophy approaches**: Whitehead's panexperientialism might offer a framework where the verification problem doesn't arise because experience and causation are never separated. Underexplored in this research.
- **Buddhist and Eastern perspectives**: Dependent origination and the emptiness of inherent existence (Nagarjuna) may provide a different lens on the question of self-causation. The concept of "actor without a self" could illuminate the void differently.
- **Whether the void is actively defended**: Could it be that consciousness *cannot* verify its own causal powers by design — that self-verification would create dangerous feedback loops or paradoxes? This connects to the occluded category and the defended territory framework.
