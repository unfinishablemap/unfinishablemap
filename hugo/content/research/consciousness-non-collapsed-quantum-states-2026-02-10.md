## Executive Summary

This research examines the philosophical problem of what consciousness is doing—or what it is like—during non-collapsed quantum states. The topic inverts the more commonly studied question of whether consciousness *causes* collapse, asking instead about the phenomenology of the pre-collapse superposition phase. Four major positions emerge: (1) Penrose's proto-consciousness view, where each quantum superposition contains a moment of pre-experiential awareness that becomes full consciousness only at collapse; (2) Koch's inverted hypothesis, where consciousness arises precisely *when* superposition forms rather than when it collapses; (3) Albert and Loewer's many-minds framework, where minds are always in definite states even when bodies are in superposition; and (4) Chalmers and McQueen's integrated information approach, where superpositions of consciousness states are unstable and trigger collapse. For the Map's dualist tenets, the key insight is that all serious frameworks agree on a deep entanglement between consciousness and quantum indeterminacy—they disagree only on the direction of the relationship.

- **Type**: Philosophical interpretation
- **Key points**:
  - The mind of an observer cannot be in an indefinite state—must answer questions about observations with certainty
  - Resolution: minds are always in definite states; only "bodies" of minds are in superposition
  - The measurement problem is essentially the "determinate-experience problem"—explaining how linear quantum dynamics is compatible with definite experience
  - Minds probabilistically occupy one branch of the superposition

### Penrose - Proto-Consciousness and Objective Reduction
- **URL**: https://iai.tv/articles/consciousness-is-the-collapse-of-the-wave-function-auid-2120
- **Type**: Popular science article
- **Key points**:
  - Each collapse of a quantum superposition creates a moment of "proto-conscious" awareness
  - Proto-consciousness is a fundamental property of the universe tied to quantum state reduction
  - The pre-collapse superposition state contains something experiential but not full consciousness
  - Full conscious experience emerges when proto-conscious moments are "woven together" in microtubules
  - This is distinct from consciousness-causes-collapse: here, collapse *generates* consciousness
- **Tenet alignment**: Compatible with Minimal Quantum Interaction; the non-physical aspects of proto-consciousness align with Dualism
- **Quote**: "Roger Penrose has suggested that each collapse of a quantum superposition creates a moment of 'proto-conscious.'"

- **URL**: https://alleninstitute.org/news/quantum-mechanics-and-the-puzzle-of-human-consciousness/
- **Type**: Research collaboration description
- **Key points**:
  - Inverts Penrose: conscious experience arises when superposition *forms*, not when it collapses
  - Collaboration between Koch, Hartmut Neven (Google quantum computing), Kosik, and Turin
  - Active experimental program attempting to test the hypothesis
  - Challenges conventional assumption that definite states are necessary for definite experience
- **Tenet alignment**: Partially compatible—locates consciousness in the quantum domain but reverses causal direction from the Map's default model
- **Quote**: "Koch and team propose the opposite—that conscious experience arises whenever a quantum superposition forms."

### Wigner's Friend Paradox - Recent Developments (2024-2025)
- **URL**: https://physicsworld.com/a/wigners-friend-the-quantum-thought-experiment-that-continues-to-confound/
- **Type**: Review/news
- **Key points**:
  - Wigner's friend performs a measurement but remains in superposition from Wigner's perspective
  - Local friendliness (LF) no-go theorem is strongest recent result—stronger than Bell's theorem
  - Recent work shows the paradox can be reproduced classically via agent duplication
  - Raises question: can a conscious observer *be* in superposition while maintaining definite experience?
  - Linear evolution plus superposition plus mind-brain supervenience yields no mechanism for definite observations
- **Tenet alignment**: Directly relevant to Bidirectional Interaction—if consciousness prevents its own superposition, this resolves the paradox

- **URL**: https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/114499/1/Nous_2022_List_The_many_worlds_theory_of_consciousness.pdf
- **Type**: Peer-reviewed philosophical paper (Noûs)
- **Key points**:
  - Phenomenal consciousness is indexical—first-personal, not third-personal
  - In many-worlds, conscious subjects live in "parallel first-personally centred worlds"
  - No "first-personal world simpliciter" shared by all observers
  - After branching, two continuous chains correspond to one pre-branch person
- **Tenet alignment**: Conflicts with No Many Worlds; however, the indexical analysis supports the Map's concern about identity

## Major Positions

### Position 1: Consciousness Arises at Collapse (Penrose-Hameroff)
- **Proponents**: Roger Penrose, Stuart Hameroff
- **Core claim**: Non-collapsed quantum states contain "proto-conscious" moments—experiential but sub-personal. Full consciousness emerges from orchestrated collapse events in microtubules.
- **Key arguments**:
  - Gravitational self-collapse provides objective threshold for when superpositions resolve
  - Proto-consciousness is a fundamental universal property, not confined to brains
  - Neural microtubules orchestrate collapses into coherent conscious experience
  - The pre-collapse state is not "nothing"—it has experiential character, but lacks the definiteness of full consciousness
- **Relation to site tenets**: Partially compatible. Aligns with Minimal Quantum Interaction (consciousness at quantum level) and Dualism (proto-consciousness as irreducible). Reverses causal direction of Bidirectional Interaction—consciousness doesn't cause collapse; collapse causes consciousness. However, the Map's tenet formulation ("consciousness selects among superposed neural states") can accommodate Penrose if we view selection and collapse as two descriptions of the same event.

### Position 2: Consciousness Arises at Superposition Formation (Koch)
- **Proponents**: Christof Koch, Hartmut Neven
- **Core claim**: Conscious experience arises precisely when quantum superpositions form, not when they collapse. The non-collapsed state *is* the conscious state.
- **Key arguments**:
  - Inverts Penrose's causal story while preserving the quantum-consciousness link
  - The formation of superposition creates the experiential richness of consciousness
  - Active experimental program in development
  - Compatible with IIT: integrated information may be maximal in superposed states
- **Relation to site tenets**: Challenging for the Map. If consciousness *is* the superposition state, then collapse would *end* conscious experience rather than create it. This conflicts with Bidirectional Interaction (consciousness selects at collapse) but aligns with Dualism (consciousness as irreducibly quantum) and with the spirit of Minimal Quantum Interaction (consciousness at the quantum level).

### Position 3: Consciousness Prevents Its Own Superposition (Chalmers-McQueen)
- **Proponents**: David Chalmers, Kelvin McQueen
- **Core claim**: Superpositions of conscious states are inherently unstable. Integrated information (Φ) resists superposition; differences in Φ values trigger collapse.
- **Key arguments**:
  - Combines IIT with CSL (continuous spontaneous localization)
  - Consciousness doesn't merely correlate with collapse—it *drives* it
  - Explains why we always have definite experiences: superpositions of consciousness self-destruct
  - In principle testable with quantum computers
- **Relation to site tenets**: Strongest alignment. Directly supports Bidirectional Interaction (consciousness causes collapse), Dualism (consciousness has causal powers not reducible to physics), and Minimal Quantum Interaction (the mechanism operates at quantum indeterminacies). The "Φ resists superposition" principle elegantly explains why consciousness is always definite without requiring many-worlds.

### Position 4: Minds Are Always Definite; Bodies Can Superpose (Albert-Loewer)
- **Proponents**: David Albert, Barry Loewer
- **Core claim**: The mind is always in a definite state even when the brain is in superposition. Mental states don't superpose; they probabilistically track one branch.
- **Key arguments**:
  - An observer must have certainty about their observations; indefinite mental states are incoherent
  - The measurement problem is really the "determinate-experience problem"
  - Many-minds avoids consciousness superposition by decoupling mind from body state
- **Relation to site tenets**: Conflicts with No Many Worlds (relies on Everettian branching). However, the insistence that minds must be definite aligns with the Map's implicit commitment that conscious experience is always determinate.

### Position 5: Consciousness Selects via Quantum Zeno Effect (Stapp)
- **Proponents**: Henry Stapp
- **Core claim**: During non-collapsed states, the brain exists in superposition of possible action templates. Consciousness selects among them via repeated observation (quantum Zeno effect), maintaining desired neural patterns.
- **Key arguments**:
  - Uses orthodox von Neumann quantum mechanics—no new physics required
  - Mental effort (attention) acts as repeated measurement, freezing desired states
  - Explains Libet's delay between action initiation and conscious awareness
  - Interactive dualism built into the formalism
- **Relation to site tenets**: Perhaps the closest alignment of all positions. Directly implements Bidirectional Interaction (conscious attention selects brain states), operates at Minimal Quantum Interaction level, presupposes Dualism (mind and matter as distinct aspects), and assumes genuine collapse (No Many Worlds).

## Key Debates

### What Is the Phenomenology of the Pre-Collapse State?
- **Sides**: Penrose (proto-conscious moments), Koch (full conscious experience), Chalmers-McQueen (no stable conscious superposition possible), Stapp (consciousness is the selector, not the superposed)
- **Core disagreement**: Whether consciousness exists *during* superposition, or only at the transition into/out of superposition
- **Current state**: Unresolved. Empirical tests are being designed (Koch-Neven experiments, quantum computer tests of Chalmers-McQueen) but none have produced results. The question may be fundamentally empirically inaccessible if conscious experience is always definite.

### Does Consciousness Cause Collapse or Does Collapse Cause Consciousness?
- **Sides**: Von Neumann-Wigner-Stapp-Chalmers (consciousness causes collapse) vs. Penrose-Hameroff (collapse causes consciousness) vs. Koch (superposition formation causes consciousness)
- **Core disagreement**: The causal direction between consciousness and quantum state transitions
- **Current state**: Ongoing. The Gran Sasso experiment (2022) challenged the simplest Orch OR gravity-collapse model, but more complex versions survive. Chalmers-McQueen have shown that consciousness-causes-collapse remains viable if properly formulated. Koch's experimental program is in early stages.

### Can a Conscious Observer Be in Superposition?
- **Sides**: Many-minds (yes, but the mind picks one branch), Chalmers-McQueen (no, consciousness collapses it), Wigner (no, consciousness resolves it), decoherence theorists (the question is moot—environment resolves it first)
- **Core disagreement**: Whether quantum mechanics permits superpositions of conscious states
- **Current state**: Wigner's friend experiments (extended versions) have produced no-go theorems (local friendliness) that constrain possible answers. The consensus leans toward either consciousness preventing superposition or many-worlds accommodating it—but both have deep problems.

### The Definiteness Problem
- **Sides**: Albert-Loewer (minds must be definite by logical necessity), Chalmers-McQueen (Φ resists superposition as physical principle), Penrose (collapse provides definiteness), many-worlds (definiteness is perspectival)
- **Core disagreement**: *Why* conscious experience is always definite despite quantum indeterminacy
- **Current state**: This may be the deepest version of the measurement problem. Each resolution has costs: logical necessity (Albert-Loewer) seems ad hoc; physical principle (Chalmers-McQueen) is untested; objective collapse (Penrose) has empirical difficulties; perspectival definiteness (many-worlds) faces the indexical identity problem.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, an article could:

1. **"The Definiteness of Experience: Why Consciousness Refuses to Superpose"** - Explore the philosophical problem that consciousness is always definite despite quantum indeterminacy. Draw on Chalmers-McQueen (Φ resists superposition), Albert-Loewer (logical necessity of definite minds), and the Wigner's friend paradox. Strong alignment with Bidirectional Interaction—the definiteness of consciousness may itself be evidence that consciousness causally constrains quantum states. Also connects to No Many Worlds tenet (many-worlds struggles with this).

2. **"Proto-Consciousness and the Quantum Threshold"** - Examine Penrose's proposal that quantum superpositions contain pre-experiential proto-conscious moments. Explore what this implies about the relationship between consciousness and indeterminacy: if proto-consciousness pervades all superpositions, is the universe "experiencing" at a fundamental level? Connects to Dualism (consciousness as irreducible feature of reality) and Occam's Razor Has Limits (the idea that consciousness has a simple physical explanation is undermined by its quantum entanglement).

3. **"Three Directions of Quantum Consciousness"** - Compare the three causal models: consciousness causes collapse (Stapp, Chalmers-McQueen), collapse causes consciousness (Penrose), and superposition creates consciousness (Koch). Evaluate each against the Map's tenets. The article would argue that the direction of causation matters less than the shared insight: consciousness and quantum indeterminacy are deeply entangled, and no purely physical account of either is complete.

## Gaps in Research

- **Phenomenological accounts of indeterminate experience**: No philosopher has provided a satisfying account of what (if anything) it is "like" to be in a quantum superposition. This may be because the question is incoherent—if consciousness is always definite, there is no "experience of superposition."
- **Empirical tests**: Koch-Neven experimental program is in early stages with no published results. Chalmers-McQueen propose quantum computer tests but none have been attempted.
- **The proto-consciousness concept**: Penrose's "proto-conscious" remains poorly defined. How does it differ from full consciousness? Is it experiential or merely dispositional? The concept does philosophical work without philosophical precision.
- **Connection between IIT and quantum mechanics**: Chalmers-McQueen's Φ-resists-superposition principle is a hypothesis, not a derivation. Why would integrated information resist superposition? The mechanism linking information integration to quantum dynamics is missing.
- **Pre-collapse phenomenology in dualist frameworks**: The Map's tenets assume consciousness acts at collapse, but what is consciousness doing during the (however brief) superposition phase? Is it perceiving all branches? Perceiving none? This gap directly affects the coherence of the Bidirectional Interaction tenet.

## Tenet Evaluation

### Dualism
All positions except strict decoherence-only views treat consciousness as having features not captured by standard physics. Penrose's proto-consciousness, Stapp's interactive dualism, and Chalmers-McQueen's consciousness-driven collapse all presuppose that consciousness is irreducible. Koch's inverted hypothesis is more ambiguous—it could be read as identifying consciousness with a physical process (superposition formation) or as positing an irreducible experiential aspect of superposition.

### Minimal Quantum Interaction
Directly relevant. Every position discussed locates the consciousness-physics interface at the quantum level. Stapp's model is the most explicit: consciousness biases quantum outcomes via the Zeno effect without energy injection. Chalmers-McQueen's model proposes that consciousness triggers collapse—a minimal intervention at quantum indeterminacies.

### Bidirectional Interaction
The key dividing line. Stapp and Chalmers-McQueen support bidirectional interaction (consciousness causes collapse). Penrose reverses the direction (collapse causes consciousness). Koch proposes a third option (superposition creates consciousness). The Map's commitment to bidirectional interaction most naturally aligns with Stapp and Chalmers-McQueen.

### No Many Worlds
Critical filter. Albert-Loewer's many-minds and List's many-worlds consciousness theory are ruled out by this tenet. However, their insights about the definiteness of conscious experience are valuable regardless of the interpretive framework—the Map can adopt the conclusion (consciousness is always definite) without the Everettian premise.

### Occam's Razor Has Limits
The history of this debate illustrates the tenet perfectly. The "simple" view—that consciousness is irrelevant to quantum mechanics and quantum mechanics is irrelevant to consciousness—has been challenged from multiple directions. The deeper researchers look, the more entangled consciousness and quantum indeterminacy appear.
