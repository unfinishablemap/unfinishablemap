## Executive Summary

Implicit memory—encompassing procedural skills, priming, and conditioning—presents a fascinating challenge for consciousness studies. Tulving's "anoetic consciousness" accompanies procedural memory: awareness without knowing, action without reflection. The Dreyfus model charts skill acquisition from rule-bound novice to intuitive expert, with consciousness receding as automaticity develops. Crucially, conscious attention to automatized skills *degrades* performance ("choking under pressure"), suggesting consciousness and procedural execution operate differently. Embodied cognition theorists use implicit memory to challenge Cartesian dualism, but the site's framework can integrate these insights: consciousness may function as an interface that delegates to procedural systems, withdrawing attention once skills are established. The phenomenology of skills becoming automatic—and the negative effects of conscious interference—provides evidence for bidirectional interaction at the attention interface.

## Key Sources

### Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Memory
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/memory/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Nondeclarative memory defined negatively: forms of memory that don't involve content the subject can bring to consciousness
  - Philosophers' "habit memory" = psychologists' "procedural memory"
  - We naturally use "remembering how" to refer to procedural memories
  - Some philosophers deny implicit memory is "genuine" memory, but this distinction is unhelpful
- **Tenet alignment**: Neutral—describes categories rather than taking positions
- **Quote**: "The category of implicit memory includes a range of heterogeneous phenomena, and it may be better to see 'implicit memory' as a label for a set of memory tasks rather than a distinct variety or system of memory."

### Tulving's Anoetic-Noetic-Autonoetic Framework
- **URL**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3879583/
- **Type**: Journal article (Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience)
- **Key points**:
  - Tulving (1985) associated procedural memory with "anoetic" (non-knowing) consciousness
  - Anoetic consciousness is bound to current situation and environment—raw response without reflection
  - It involves "non-reflective qualia"—phenomenal feel without explicit awareness
  - Anoetic consciousness provides "phenomenal feel and sense of ownership" to higher states
  - Hierarchical model: anoetic → noetic → autonoetic
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports dualism—even "unconscious" procedural memory has phenomenal character
- **Quote**: "Anoetic consciousness reflects a primal state of autonomic-phenomenal awakeness, with direct experiences of oneself and the world."

### Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition
- **Type**: Encyclopedia / Research paper summary
- **Key points**:
  - Five stages: novice → advanced beginner → competent → proficient → expert
  - Key transition: from rule-following to intuitive performance
  - Experts "do what normally works" without reflective decision-making
  - Over-reliance on rules prevents advancement—learners must "let go"
  - Phenomenological foundations in Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty
- **Tenet alignment**: Neutral to supportive—consciousness recedes but doesn't disappear
- **Quote**: "When things are proceeding normally, experts don't solve problems and don't make decisions; they do what normally works."

### Choking Under Pressure
- **URL**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4322702/
- **Type**: Journal article (Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience)
- **Key points**:
  - Two theories: distraction vs. explicit monitoring
  - Explicit monitoring: pressure causes conscious attention to proceduralized skills
  - This attention disrupts automatic performance—"reinvestment" of explicit control
  - Skills that normally run "outside conscious awareness" are degraded by attention
  - Training without explicit awareness protects against choking
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports bidirectional interaction—consciousness causally interferes with procedural execution
- **Quote**: "Attention to skill execution at the step-by-step level disrupts the automated functioning of such skills."

### Embodied Cognition and Body Memory
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/embodied-cognition/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Merleau-Ponty: body knowledge is "third dimension" between imagination and motor execution
  - Body memory refutes dualism of pure consciousness and physical body
  - Implicit mastery of sensorimotor contingencies underlies conscious experience
  - Skills are embodied—neither purely mental nor purely physical
- **Tenet alignment**: *Appears* to conflict with dualism, but actually supports interface hypothesis
- **Quote**: "The memory of the body is an impressive refutation of the dualism of pure consciousness and the physical body."

### Ryle on Knowledge How vs. Knowledge That
- **URL**: https://philpapers.org/rec/PAVPMA-2v2
- **Type**: Philosophy paper (PhilArchive)
- **Key points**:
  - Ryle (1949) distinguished knowing-how from knowing-that
  - Cohen and Squire (1980) equated procedural/declarative distinction to this
  - Know-how involves dispositions rather than explicit propositions
  - Stanley (2011) challenges the distinction—controversial
- **Tenet alignment**: Neutral—taxonomic framework
- **Quote**: "Despite the seeming acceptance of know how and its importance to the scientific study of human cognition, philosophers devote little attention to knowledge how."

### Implicit Knowledge and Unconscious Processing
- **URL**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC50499/
- **Type**: Journal article (Cell)
- **Key points**:
  - Brain-damaged patients and normal subjects show nonconscious knowledge
  - Dissociations observed across domains: perception, memory, learning
  - Blindsight: above-chance performance without conscious awareness
  - Priming: processing affected by stimuli below awareness threshold
- **Tenet alignment**: Complex—shows unconscious processing but raises questions about phenomenology
- **Quote**: "Dissociations between implicit and explicit knowledge raise fundamental questions about the nature of perception, memory, and consciousness."

## Major Positions

### Tulving's Hierarchical Consciousness Model
- **Proponents**: Endel Tulving, Jaak Panksepp, Douglas Watt
- **Core claim**: Three levels of consciousness correspond to three memory systems:
  - Anoetic (unknowing) → procedural memory
  - Noetic (knowing) → semantic memory
  - Autonoetic (self-knowing) → episodic memory
- **Key arguments**:
  - Even procedural memory has phenomenal character ("non-reflective qualia")
  - Consciousness is a continuum, not all-or-nothing
  - Lower levels provide "feel" to higher levels
- **Relation to site tenets**: Supports dualism—even implicit memory has phenomenal dimension. Aligns with tenet that consciousness is not identical to neural activity.

### Embodied/Enactive Cognition
- **Proponents**: Merleau-Ponty, Varela, Thompson, Rosch, Andy Clark
- **Core claim**: Cognition is inseparable from embodiment; mind-body dualism is false
- **Key arguments**:
  - Body memory refutes separation of consciousness from physical body
  - Implicit skills are neither purely mental nor purely physical
  - Conscious experience depends on implicit sensorimotor mastery
  - Phenomenology eliminates both entity and attribute dualism
- **Relation to site tenets**: *Apparently* conflicts with dualism, but compatible with interface hypothesis. the site doesn't claim consciousness is disembodied—it interacts *through* the body at specific interfaces. Body memory shows *where* the interface operates, not that there's no consciousness distinct from body.

### Explicit Monitoring Theory (Choking)
- **Proponents**: Baumeister, Beilock, Masters
- **Core claim**: Conscious attention to automatized skills disrupts performance
- **Key arguments**:
  - Pressure → anxiety → self-focus → step-by-step monitoring
  - This "reinvests" explicit control in what should be automatic
  - Proceduralized skills run "outside conscious awareness" normally
  - Training without explicit awareness protects against choking
- **Relation to site tenets**: Strongly supports bidirectional interaction. If consciousness had no causal power, how could attending to skills disrupt them? The very fact that conscious attention *interferes* with procedural execution shows consciousness causally affects brain processes.

### Dreyfus Phenomenological Model
- **Proponents**: Hubert Dreyfus, Stuart Dreyfus, Patricia Benner
- **Core claim**: Skill acquisition progresses from rule-following to intuitive expertise
- **Key arguments**:
  - Novices use explicit rules requiring conscious effort
  - Experts act intuitively without reflective decision-making
  - Over-reliance on rules stalls development
  - Experts must "let go" of explicit knowledge
- **Relation to site tenets**: Compatible—describes *how* consciousness interacts with skill systems. Initial learning requires conscious attention (interface engaged); expertise develops as skills become delegated to procedural systems (interface withdraws). Consciousness retains ability to re-engage (and disrupt!) when needed.

## Key Debates

### Does Implicit Memory Have Phenomenology?
- **Sides**:
  - Tulving/Panksepp: Yes—anoetic consciousness involves "non-reflective qualia"
  - Computational functionalists: No—implicit memory is purely functional
- **Core disagreement**: Whether procedural execution involves "something it's like"
- **Current state**: Ongoing. Tulving's framework gaining acceptance in affective neuroscience; phenomenologists agree body has its own "knowing."

### Is Implicit Learning Truly Unconscious?
- **Sides**:
  - Strong implicit learning: Yes—learning occurs without any awareness
  - Weak implicit learning: Awareness is implicit, not absent
- **Core disagreement**: Whether there's genuine learning without any form of consciousness
- **Current state**: Methodological debates continue. The term "unconscious" may be imprecise—"implicit" may be more accurate.

### Does Body Memory Refute Dualism?
- **Sides**:
  - Merleau-Ponty/Embodied cognition: Yes—body memory is neither mental nor physical
  - Interactionist dualism: No—shows *where* mind-body interaction occurs
- **Core disagreement**: Whether embodiment eliminates the need for distinct consciousness
- **Current state**: Ongoing. Site's position: body memory reveals the *interface*, not the *identity* of mind and body.

### Knowledge How vs. Knowledge That
- **Sides**:
  - Ryle/Anti-intellectualists: Know-how is fundamentally different from know-that
  - Stanley/Intellectualists: Know-how is a species of propositional knowledge
- **Core disagreement**: Whether procedural knowledge reduces to declarative knowledge
- **Current state**: Active philosophical debate. Stanley's intellectualism controversial.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, an article on implicit memory could:

1. **The Phenomenology of Automaticity** - Focus on what happens phenomenologically as skills become automatic. Key insight: anoetic consciousness is still consciousness—not absence of experience but a different mode. Aligns with dualism (phenomenal character persists) and interface hypothesis (attention withdraws but doesn't disappear).

2. **Choking as Evidence for Bidirectional Interaction** - Use the choking phenomenon as empirical evidence for consciousness causally affecting brain processes. If consciousness were epiphenomenal, how could attending to skills disrupt them? The very interference proves causal efficacy.

3. **Body Memory and the Interface** - Engage with Merleau-Ponty's challenge to dualism. Argue that body memory reveals *where* the interface operates, not that consciousness is identical to body. Implicit skills are delegated functions; consciousness retains override capacity (as choking shows).

4. **Skill Acquisition as Interface Calibration** - Use Dreyfus model to describe how consciousness calibrates the interface. Early learning = intense conscious engagement. Expertise = stable delegation to procedural systems. Consciousness can re-engage but doing so degrades performance—suggesting the interface is optimized for selective engagement.

When writing the article, follow `obsidian/project/writing-style.md` for:
- Named-anchor summary technique for forward references
- Background vs. novelty decisions (Tulving/Dreyfus frameworks may be assumed; site-specific integration is the novelty)
- Tenet alignment requirements (connect to bidirectional interaction, interface hypothesis)
- LLM optimization (front-load the distinctive claim about implicit memory and consciousness)

## Gaps in Research

- **Quantum connection**: No direct research on whether procedural execution involves quantum processes. the site's quantum mechanism focuses on attention; is procedural memory "outside" this mechanism?
- **AI implications**: LLMs can implement procedural-like processes but lack phenomenology. What does this mean for anoetic consciousness?
- **Developmental transition**: How does the anoetic → noetic → autonoetic hierarchy develop ontogenetically? Relevant to childhood amnesia.
- **Meditation and skills**: Do contemplative practices alter the relationship between consciousness and procedural memory? Potential neurophenomenology connection.

## Implications for Site Framework

The research supports several site positions:

1. **Bidirectional interaction**: Choking under pressure is direct evidence. Consciousness causally interferes with procedural execution. If consciousness were epiphenomenal, this couldn't happen.

2. **Interface hypothesis**: Skill acquisition shows consciousness *withdrawing* from certain processes while retaining override capacity. This is exactly what an interface would do—engage when needed, delegate when established.

3. **Against eliminativism**: Even Tulving's "anoetic" consciousness has phenomenal character. There's no cognitive domain without some form of experience.

4. **Nuanced dualism**: Embodied cognition challenges crude substance dualism but supports the site's interface framework. Body memory isn't refutation—it's evidence of *where* the interface operates.
