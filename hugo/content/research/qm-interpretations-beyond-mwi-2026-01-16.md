## Executive Summary

The Unfinishable Map explicitly rejects [Many-Worlds Interpretation](/arguments/many-worlds/) (MWI) but should engage more thoroughly with alternative QM interpretations. This research surveys Bohmian mechanics, QBism, relational QM, transactional/TSVF interpretations, and objective collapse theories (GRW/CSL)—clarifying which leave room for consciousness-as-selector, which treat collapse as physical law, and which treat it as epistemic.

A 2025 Nature survey found that only 36% of physicists favor Copenhagen, with no interpretation commanding majority support. The interpretive landscape remains genuinely open.

## The Interpretations

### 1. Copenhagen Interpretation (Baseline)

**Core claims:**
- Wave function represents knowledge, not reality
- Measurement causes collapse (but "measurement" is undefined)
- Classical apparatus is presumed to exist

**Relation to consciousness:** The original Copenhagen view avoided the question by requiring classical apparatus. Von Neumann and Wigner later suggested consciousness might be the collapse trigger, but this isn't standard Copenhagen.

**Site compatibility:** Moderate. Copenhagen leaves the measurement problem unsolved, creating logical space for consciousness. But Copenhagen's instrumentalism conflicts with the Map's realist commitments.

### 2. Bohmian Mechanics (Pilot-Wave Theory)

**Core claims:**
- Particles have definite positions at all times
- Wave function is a "pilot wave" guiding particle trajectories
- Deterministic: apparent randomness reflects ignorance of initial conditions
- No collapse—wave function evolves unitarily forever

**Key features:**
- Restores determinism by adding hidden variables (particle positions)
- Requires instantaneous non-local influences to explain entanglement
- Difficult to reconcile with special relativity

**Relation to consciousness:** **Minimal to none.** Bohmian mechanics is explicitly designed to eliminate the observer from physics. There is no collapse for consciousness to participate in. The measurement problem dissolves because particles always have positions; we just don't know them.

**Site compatibility:** **Low.** If Bohmian mechanics is correct, the Map's Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet has no work to do. Consciousness cannot select outcomes because outcomes are determined by the pilot wave. Free will would require a different mechanism.

**Potential reconciliation:** Some have suggested consciousness might influence initial conditions or the pilot wave itself, but this goes beyond standard Bohmian mechanics.

### 3. QBism (Quantum Bayesianism)

**Core claims:**
- Quantum states represent an agent's degrees of belief, not objective reality
- Probabilities are subjective (Bayesian), updated upon measurement
- "Collapse" is simply belief update, not a physical process
- No single shared reality; each agent has their own quantum state assignments

**Key features:**
- Radically agent-centered
- Eliminates the measurement problem by denying wave functions are real
- Different agents can consistently assign different states to the same system

**Relation to consciousness:** **Paradoxical.** On one hand, QBism makes agents central—only agents have quantum states (beliefs). On the other hand, QBism denies quantum states are real, so there's nothing for consciousness to collapse. The agent's experience of measurement is epistemically fundamental but ontologically not explained.

**Site compatibility:** **Mixed.**
- *Against:* QBism's anti-realism conflicts with the Map's commitment to real conscious states
- *For:* QBism's agent-centrality echoes the Map's phenomenological emphasis
- QBism sidesteps consciousness questions rather than answering them

### 4. Relational Quantum Mechanics (RQM)

**Core claims:**
- Physical properties exist only relative to observers
- There is no absolute, observer-independent state
- Different observers can consistently attribute different states
- Reality is relational, not absolute

**Key features:**
- Developed by Carlo Rovelli
- Takes quantum theory's relationality as fundamental rather than problematic
- Related to QBism but more realist about the relations themselves

**Relation to consciousness:** **Unclear.** RQM makes all physical facts relational but doesn't specify what counts as an "observer." If any physical system can be an observer, consciousness is not privileged. If consciousness is required, RQM supports something like the Map's view.

**Site compatibility:** **Moderate.** RQM's emphasis on relations over absolutes could align with the Map's rejection of view-from-nowhere physicalism. But RQM's typical interpretation doesn't require consciousness specifically.

### 5. Transactional Interpretation (TI) and Two-State Vector Formalism (TSVF)

**Core claims (TI):**
- Quantum events involve "handshakes" between retarded (forward-in-time) and advanced (backward-in-time) waves
- A "transaction" between emitter and absorber constitutes a measurement
- Time-symmetric: future boundary conditions matter as much as past
- Developed by John Cramer (1986)

**Core claims (TSVF):**
- Complete description requires both forward-evolving and backward-evolving quantum states
- Developed by Aharonov, Bergmann, Lebowitz (1964)
- Allows "weak values" with unusual properties
- Explicitly retrocausal

**Key differences:** TI provides a physical mechanism (transaction handshake) while TSVF is more formal. TI eliminates observer-dependence; TSVF is compatible with various ontologies.

**Relation to consciousness:** **Significant for the Map.**
- Retrocausality is already central to the Map's treatment of free will and the Libet problem
- Time-symmetric interpretations allow consciousness to select "which transaction completes" atemporally
- Consciousness need not cause collapse *at* a moment—it participates in determining which correlations hold across time

**Site compatibility:** **High.** Time-symmetric interpretations align with the Map's use of retrocausality to resolve the Libet problem. The [collapse-and-time](/concepts/collapse-and-time/) page already draws on this framework. TI/TSVF provide the physics for "atemporal selection."

### 6. Objective Collapse Theories (GRW, CSL, Penrose)

**Core claims:**
- Wave function collapse is a real physical process occurring spontaneously
- No observer required—collapse happens at a certain rate/threshold
- GRW: spontaneous localization events occur randomly
- CSL: continuous spontaneous localization driven by noise
- Penrose: gravitational self-energy threshold triggers collapse

**Key features:**
- Modify the Schrödinger equation (testable in principle)
- Explain macroscopic definiteness without observers
- No experiments have yet detected spontaneous collapse deviations

**Relation to consciousness:**

**Standard objective collapse:** **Low direct role.** If collapse happens physically according to GRW/CSL parameters, consciousness doesn't cause it. Collapse happens whether or not anyone is conscious.

**Consciousness-integrated CSL:** Proposals by Kremnizer-Ranchin and Okon-Sebastian modify CSL so that integrated information (Φ from IIT) affects collapse rate or operator. Consciousness doesn't cause collapse but *modulates* it—higher consciousness = faster/more stable collapse.

**Penrose-Hameroff:** Objective reduction occurs at gravitational threshold, but consciousness is what the reduction *produces*. Consciousness doesn't cause collapse; collapse constitutes consciousness.

**Site compatibility:** **Moderate to High.**
- Standard GRW/CSL don't require consciousness, but they're compatible with consciousness having a role
- Consciousness-integrated CSL variants align closely with Minimal Quantum Interaction
- Penrose's view—collapse produces rather than is caused by consciousness—differs from the Map's Bidirectional Interaction but could be integrated

### Summary Table: Interpretations and Consciousness

## Recommendations for the Map

### Explicitly Position Against Bohmian Mechanics

Bohmian mechanics is the main deterministic alternative to collapse interpretations. The Map should acknowledge it and explain why it's not preferred:

1. **Determinism conflicts with free will phenomenology.** the Map takes the phenomenology of effort and choice seriously. Bohmian determinism makes this illusory.

2. **Non-locality problems.** Bohmian mechanics requires faster-than-light influences, creating tension with relativity that collapse interpretations avoid.

3. **Occam's Razor cuts both ways.** Bohmians add hidden variables (particle positions) to eliminate the measurement problem. But if consciousness solves the measurement problem more parsimoniously, hidden variables are unnecessary.

### Develop the TI/TSVF Connection

The Map already uses retrocausality for free will but hasn't explicitly connected to TI/TSVF foundations:

1. Add a concept page on transactional interpretation
2. Clarify how "atemporal selection" relates to physical transactions
3. Address potential conflicts with presentism/eternalism in philosophy of time

### Engage QBism's Challenge

QBism is influential and agent-centered. The Map should:

1. Acknowledge QBism's phenomenological orientation as partially aligned
2. Critique QBism's anti-realism about quantum states
3. Show how the Map's realism preserves what's valuable in agent-centrality

### Clarify the GRW/CSL Relationship

Objective collapse theories provide an alternative "consciousness doesn't cause collapse" story. The Map should:

1. Acknowledge that collapse could be physical (GRW/CSL/Penrose)
2. Explain why consciousness-integrated variants are preferred—they explain *why* collapse produces experience, not just that it does
3. Note that the Map's position is compatible with either "consciousness causes collapse" or "consciousness modulates collapse"

## Key Insight

The interpretive landscape remains genuinely open. The 2025 Nature survey found only 24% of physicists were confident their preferred interpretation was correct. The Map's position—consciousness participates in collapse—is not ruled out by physics. The question is which interpretation best explains both quantum phenomena and the existence of consciousness.

The Map's advantage: it takes consciousness seriously as explanatory target, not just as philosophical add-on. Interpretations that eliminate consciousness (Bohmian) or treat it as purely epistemic (QBism) don't explain why consciousness exists at all. The Map's framework does.
