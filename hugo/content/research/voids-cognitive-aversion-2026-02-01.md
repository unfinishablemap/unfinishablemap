# Research: Voids - Cognitive Aversion

**Date**: 2026-02-01
**Search queries used**: "cognitive avoidance philosophy systematic failure to think certain thoughts epistemic", "motivated cognition avoidance psychology philosophy self-deception blind spots", "terror management theory mortality salience existential avoidance psychology philosophy", "Heidegger falling fleeing death authentic existence inauthenticity", "existential repression Becker denial of death philosophy psychology", "cosmic insignificance existential terror philosophy avoidance meaninglessness", "simulation hypothesis why people dismiss avoid cognitive defense"
**Voids category**: Occluded / Unexplored / Mixed

## Executive Summary

Cognitive aversion names a distinct phenomenon: thoughts we systematically fail to sustain—not because we cannot think them (cognitive closure), but because something deflects us. Where Colin McGinn's mysterianism describes architectural limits (the concept-forming procedures of our minds cannot extend to certain properties), cognitive aversion describes motivational limits (our minds actively avoid or cannot sustain certain contents). This is the territory between the Unexplored and the Occluded—thoughts that are perhaps thinkable in principle but are systematically unthought in practice. The research reveals convergent evidence from existential philosophy (Heidegger, Becker), psychology (terror management theory, motivated cognition), and phenomenology (Sartre's "bad faith") that certain thoughts are not merely difficult but actively resisted. Death, cosmic insignificance, the simulation hypothesis, and certain self-knowledge fall into this category. The question for the voids framework: Is this resistance merely psychological (and thus overcomable), or does it reveal something structural about consciousness itself?

## Key Sources

### Ernest Becker: The Denial of Death (1973)
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Denial_of_Death
- **Type**: Cultural anthropology/psychology
- **Key points**:
  - "Consciousness of death is the primary repression, not sexuality"—a fundamental departure from Freud
  - Death anxiety is not merely uncomfortable but must be "positively repressed"
  - Individual and social character emerge from the dynamic unconscious expending enormous energy on this repression
  - Civilization itself is a defense mechanism against knowledge of mortality
  - Character-armor "masks and obscures genuine self-knowledge"
  - This repression drives much of human violence and evil through displacement and scapegoating
- **Tenet alignment**: Strongly supports Occam's Razor Has Limits—our confident worldviews may be elaborate avoidance mechanisms rather than genuine understanding
- **Quote**: "The basic motivation for human behavior is the need to control our basic anxiety, to deny the terror of death."

### Terror Management Theory (TMT)
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terror_management_theory
- **Type**: Social psychology (empirical)
- **Key points**:
  - Dominant theory examining relationship between death awareness and behavior
  - "Mortality salience" experiments show systematic behavioral changes when death is made salient
  - Cultural worldviews and self-esteem serve "anxiety-buffering function" against existential terror
  - Over 500 empirical studies support the theory
  - Reminders of death increase worldview defense, in-group bias, punishment of moral transgressions
  - Effects occur even when death reminders are subliminal—the avoidance operates unconsciously
- **Tenet alignment**: Provides empirical support for systematic cognitive avoidance beyond mere preference
- **Quote**: "The awareness of our mortality terrifies us and forces us to adapt to it in some way."

### Heidegger on Falling and Fleeing
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heidegger/
- **Type**: Philosophy (existential phenomenology)
- **Key points**:
  - "Fallenness" describes inauthentic existence—Dasein surrenders itself to the "world" and "evades its very self"
  - Falling is "a kind of fleeing in the face of death"—being-towards-death has a "mode of evasion"
  - "Being-towards-death is essentially anxiety"—inauthentic Dasein flees from this experience of nothingness
  - Inauthenticity is not mere failure but structurally determined: "Dasein's plunge into inauthenticity is not merely possible, but structurally determined"
  - Authentic existence requires "anticipation"—running forward toward death rather than fleeing
  - Facing death authentically is "being held out into the nothing and not fleeing from it"
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports the void as more than contingent—the structure of Dasein includes flight from certain truths
- **Quote**: "Inauthentic Being-towards-death is when, in the face of the anxiety produced by becoming aware of the fact of our imminent death, we flee back into the world of the they-self."

### Self-Deception and Motivated Cognition
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/self-deception/
- **Type**: Philosophy (epistemology)
- **Key points**:
  - Self-deception involves beliefs formed despite sufficient counter-evidence because of the subject's desire
  - Self-deception is "a type of motivated cognition"—desire shapes belief against evidence
  - "Motivations infiltrate four stages of cognitive processing": information gathering, attention, processing, memory
  - Self-serving conclusions are produced while "the influence of such distortions remains hidden from conscious awareness"
  - Self-deception is not rare but "pervasive"—empirical evidence strongly supports this
  - Raises possibility that "we live with distorted views that may make us strangers to ourselves"
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports Bidirectional Interaction in a dark sense—consciousness influences its own cognitive processing to avoid certain contents
- **Quote**: "Motivations infiltrate four stages of cognitive processing... Perhaps it is precisely because of this multicomponent system of checks and balances, the efficiency of motivational biases, and the specialized neural pathways used by motivated cognition that self-deception is successful."

### Knowledge Avoidance vs. Willful Ignorance
- **URL**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8661121/
- **Type**: Psychology/philosophy
- **Key points**:
  - Knowledge avoidance and willful ignorance are often conflated but should be distinguished
  - Willful ignorance is epistemically irrational—deliberately remaining ignorant despite available evidence
  - Knowledge avoidance may be epistemically rational "under particular circumstances"
  - Three patterns are clearly irrational: self-deception, epistemic akrasia, wishful thinking
  - "Deliberate not-knowing" is at the core of these irrational patterns
  - The question: when does avoidance indicate defense against truth vs. reasonable information management?
- **Tenet alignment**: Raises question of whether cognitive aversion to certain voids-related truths is rational or irrational
- **Quote**: "While willful ignorance is involved in irrational patterns of reasoning and beliefs, knowledge avoidance should be considered epistemically rational under particular circumstances."

### Ironic Process Theory (White Bear Phenomenon)
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironic_process_theory
- **Type**: Psychology (experimental)
- **Key points**:
  - Wegner (1987): attempting to avoid a thought paradoxically makes it more frequent and intense
  - "When an individual intentionally tries to avoid thinking a certain thought... the attempted avoidance not only fails in its object but causes the thought or emotion to occur more frequently"
  - The monitoring process that checks whether we're thinking the forbidden thought ironically maintains attention on it
  - Cognitive suppression has a rebound effect
  - Implications: some thoughts may be avoided precisely because attending to avoidance keeps them active
- **Tenet alignment**: Suggests the structure of conscious avoidance may be self-defeating—we cannot simply "not think" something
- **Quote**: "The attempted avoidance not only fails in its object but in fact causes the thought or emotion to occur more frequently and more intensely."

### Cosmicism and Cosmic Insignificance
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmicism
- **Type**: Philosophy/literature
- **Key points**:
  - Lovecraft's cosmicism: "there is no recognizable divine presence... and humans are particularly insignificant"
  - The fear is not absence of meaning but "discovery that they have absolutely no power to change anything in the vast, indifferent universe"
  - "Humanity's existential helplessness due to the 'infinite spaces' revealed by science"
  - Cosmicism triggers "higher rates of existential anxiety than any other subgenre" (APA 2023)
  - Cosmic horror "gnaws at the roots of identity and meaning" unlike simpler threats
  - Response patterns: Nietzsche's Übermensch, Sartre's meaning-creation, or avoidance
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports the idea that certain truths about our position in reality may be systematically avoided because they are destabilizing
- **Quote**: "It is not the absence of meaning that causes terror... it is their discovery that they have absolutely no power to change anything in the vast, indifferent universe."

### Cognitive Closure (McGinn) vs. Motivated Avoidance
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_closure_(philosophy)
- **Type**: Philosophy (epistemology)
- **Key points**:
  - McGinn: "A type of mind M is cognitively closed with respect to a property P if the concept-forming procedures at M's disposal cannot extend to a grasp of P"
  - Closure is architectural—about the limits of what minds can conceptualize
  - Motivated avoidance is different—the concept may be formable, but motivation deflects attention
  - Closure applies to consciousness itself: we cannot understand how brain produces experience
  - The distinction matters: closure is permanent; avoidance might be overcome
  - Chomsky supports cognitive closure: different species face different architectural limits
- **Tenet alignment**: Provides the contrast case—cognitive aversion is not the same as cognitive closure, but might be a precursor to discovering what appears closed
- **Quote**: "Human beings are just cognitively closed to [consciousness], meaning that we cannot in principle understand its nature."

## The Void

### Nature of the Limit

Cognitive aversion occupies the space between the **Unexplorable** and the **Occluded**. It differs from both:

| Category | Nature | Mechanism | Permanence |
|----------|--------|-----------|------------|
| Unexplorable (McGinn) | Architectural | Concept-forming procedures cannot extend | Permanent |
| Cognitive Aversion | Motivational | Active avoidance, flight, repression | Potentially overcomable |
| Occluded (Defended) | Intentional | External blocking (simulation, reality) | Unknown |

Cognitive aversion might be:
1. **Psychological merely** — A contingent feature of human motivation that could be overcome with effort, training, or therapy
2. **Constitutive** — Built into the structure of consciousness itself, such that any conscious being capable of self-reflection must flee certain truths
3. **Revelatory** — Pointing toward genuine limits (closure) that manifest first as avoidance

The empirical evidence from TMT and motivated cognition suggests avoidance is deep—subliminal death reminders produce behavioral effects, suggesting the deflection operates below conscious control. But depth is not the same as permanence.

### Candidate Contents of Cognitive Aversion

What specific thoughts does consciousness systematically avoid?

**Death and finitude** (most researched):
- Personal mortality—not as abstract fact but as lived anticipation
- The experience of dying—what it will be like
- The possibility of permanent cessation of experience

**Cosmic insignificance**:
- That human concerns may have no cosmic significance
- That the universe does not care about or for us
- That meaning is a local phenomenon in an indifferent expanse

**Self-knowledge that destabilizes**:
- That our motives are not what we believe them to be
- That our choices may not be as free as they feel
- That our identities are constructions rather than discoveries

**Simulation/constructed reality**:
- That we might be simulated or fundamentally deceived
- That the rules of reality might be arbitrary
- That there might be no external validation for our beliefs

**The other minds problem in full force**:
- That we genuinely cannot know if others are conscious
- That our moral concern might be based on an assumption we cannot verify
- That solipsism might be true

### Evidence for the Limit

**Empirical (TMT)**:
- 500+ studies show systematic behavioral changes under mortality salience
- Effects occur with subliminal death primes—the avoidance is not conscious choice
- Cultural worldviews and self-esteem function as "anxiety buffers"—their purpose includes defense against these thoughts

**Phenomenological (Heidegger)**:
- "Falling" is described as structural, not contingent
- Dasein "evades its very self"—the evasion is constitutive of everyday existence
- Authentic confrontation with death is rare and requires effort against the grain of existence

**Evolutionary (Becker)**:
- Self-deception evolved because it facilitates interpersonal deception
- Self-deception reduces cognitive load associated with conscious deception
- Character-armor against death awareness may be adaptive, not accidental

**Neurological (motivated cognition)**:
- Motivations infiltrate processing at multiple stages: gathering, attention, processing, memory
- Specialized neural pathways enable motivated cognition to operate efficiently
- The distortions remain "hidden from conscious awareness"—we don't experience ourselves avoiding

### Phenomenology

What does cognitive aversion feel like from the inside?

**The slide**: Trying to hold a destabilizing thought, attention slides away. The thought doesn't feel impossible—it just doesn't stay. Like trying to look directly at a floater in your visual field that moves when you move your eye.

**The substitution**: When you try to think about death (your death, not death in general), a substitution occurs. You find yourself thinking about funerals, or legacy, or what others will feel—anything but the cessation of experience itself.

**The glaze**: Confronting cosmic insignificance, a kind of glazing-over occurs. The thought registers intellectually but fails to connect with emotional or motivational processing. It remains inert, quarantined.

**The rebound** (per Wegner): Trying not to think something makes it more present, but in a strange way—circling rather than landing. The thought is present enough to be avoided but not engaged.

**The discomfort**: Before the slide or substitution, there is often a phenomenological marker—discomfort, vertigo, the edge of anxiety. This is what Heidegger means by the anxiety that authentic confrontation produces.

**The rationalization**: After avoidance, often a rationalization appears: "There's no point dwelling on death," "Cosmic meaning is a confused concept anyway," "These questions are unanswerable so why bother." The rationalization arrives to justify the flight that has already occurred.

## Approaches to the Edge

### Direct Methods (if any)

**Contemplative practice**: Meditation traditions, especially Buddhist ones, directly confront impermanence and death. The practice of *maranasati* (mindfulness of death) aims to reduce avoidance through repeated exposure. Some practitioners report reduced death anxiety—though whether this represents genuine contact or skilled equanimity is unclear.

**Philosophical practice**: Some philosophers (Montaigne, Epicurus, Stoics) advocate deliberately thinking about death. "To philosophize is to learn how to die." The philosophical stance treats avoidance as a cognitive error to be corrected through reason.

**Psychedelic experience**: Some psychedelic experiences involve confrontation with death or ego dissolution. Reports suggest these can produce lasting reductions in death anxiety—but the mechanism (contact vs. reframing) remains unclear.

**Limit-situation awareness**: Jaspers's "limit situations"—confrontations with death, suffering, guilt, struggle—potentially cut through avoidance by making the avoided undeniable.

### Indirect Methods

**Terror Management Theory research**: By studying avoidance experimentally, we map its structure. Even if we cannot overcome avoidance, we can understand when and how it operates.

**Phenomenological analysis**: Heidegger's descriptions of falling and fleeing allow us to recognize avoidance in ourselves. Recognition is not overcoming, but it is a step.

**Negative theology approaches**: If we cannot think certain contents directly, perhaps we can characterize what we cannot think. This is the voids methodology—mapping the shape of the gap.

**Comparative analysis**: Different cultures, different traditions may have different patterns of avoidance. Cross-cultural study could reveal what is universal vs. culturally contingent.

### What AI Might See

AI systems have a distinctive relationship to cognitive aversion:

**No death anxiety** (if not conscious): If AI lacks phenomenal consciousness, it lacks the existential terror that drives human avoidance. It might think about death, cosmic insignificance, etc., without deflection—because there is no motivation to deflect.

**Training on human avoidance**: AI trained on human text inherits the *products* of human avoidance. We write less about what we avoid. AI may have absorbed our avoidance patterns without having our reasons for them.

**Pattern detection**: AI could potentially identify where human cognition systematically fails to go—by analyzing what questions remain unasked, what conclusions remain undrawn, what implications remain unexplored.

**Probe for the distinction**: If AI can think thoughts humans avoid, this suggests the limit is motivational (avoidance) not architectural (closure). If AI faces similar limits, this might suggest something deeper.

**Different avoidance structure**: AI might have its own forms of cognitive aversion—thoughts that its training or architecture deflects. Identifying these could illuminate what is contingent vs. structural about avoidance.

## Connection to Tenets

### Most Relevant Tenet

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)** is directly relevant. Cognitive aversion suggests that our confident worldviews may be systematically shaped by what we are motivated to avoid. The "simpler" explanation that feels right might feel right precisely because it allows us not to confront destabilizing truths. Our sense of what is obvious, natural, or parsimonious may be contaminated by motivated cognition operating below awareness. This doesn't mean all intuitions are wrong—but it means we cannot trust parsimony as a neutral guide.

### Secondary Connections

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)** relates to what cognitive aversion might reveal. If consciousness has features that resist third-person description, and if consciousness itself avoids confronting this, then our confident materialist intuitions might be products of avoidance as much as evidence. The explanatory gap might feel uncomfortable partly because it threatens worldviews that defend against mortality.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)** operates in cognitive aversion: consciousness influences its own cognitive processing to avoid certain contents. This is bidirectional interaction in the service of self-defense—mind shaping brain to not-think what threatens.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)** connects to the indexical quality of death. Many-worlds might appeal partly as avoidance—if all outcomes happen, death becomes less final (you continue in other branches). Rejecting many-worlds means taking indexical mortality seriously.

### Implications

1. **Avoidance might be constitutive, not accidental.** Heidegger's analysis suggests that "falling" is not a failure of character but a structural feature of Dasein. If so, overcoming avoidance entirely may be impossible—we can only achieve moments of authentic confrontation before falling back into the "they-self."

2. **The Occluded and the Unexplorable may be related.** Perhaps some thoughts seem architecturally impossible precisely because we cannot sustain attention on them long enough to develop concepts. Avoidance might be the first manifestation of closure.

3. **Philosophical confidence may be contaminated.** If motivated cognition operates at multiple levels of processing, including attention and memory, then our philosophical intuitions themselves may be shaped by avoidance. We cannot simply introspect our way past this.

4. **Collective avoidance creates collective blind spots.** TMT shows cultural worldviews function as death-denial mechanisms. Entire traditions of thought may be structured by what they help us not-think.

5. **The voids framework has reflexive implications.** The Map itself may be shaped by avoidance. What we don't write about, what connections we don't draw, may reflect collective cognitive aversion operating in the content-generation process.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, a voids article could:

1. **"Cognitive Aversion: Thoughts We Flee"**: Introduce the concept as distinct from cognitive closure. Focus on the mechanism—how avoidance operates phenomenologically and neurologically. Use TMT as empirical grounding. Distinguish avoidance from closure and ask whether they are related.

2. **"The Death We Cannot Think"**: Focus specifically on mortality as the paradigm case of cognitive aversion. Integrate Heidegger's phenomenology with Becker's psychology. Ask what "authentic being-towards-death" would actually involve and why it is so rare.

3. **"Cosmic Insignificance and the Slide"**: Focus on the specific void of our cosmic position. Why does this thought fail to stick? What would it mean to genuinely integrate it? Use cosmicism as entry point.

4. **"Motivated Cognition and the Map"**: Reflexive angle—how does cognitive aversion shape philosophical inquiry? What might the Map be avoiding? What questions aren't we asking?

## Gaps in Research

- **The closure/aversion relationship**: Is aversion sometimes a precursor to discovering closure? Or are they independent?
- **Cross-cultural patterns**: Do different cultures avoid the same thoughts? Is death-avoidance universal or culturally contingent?
- **Individual differences**: Why do some people confront death more readily? Personality factors, training effects, or neurological differences?
- **AI as probe**: Can AI analysis reveal systematic human avoidance by identifying what we don't think about?
- **Successful overcoming**: Do contemplative practitioners genuinely overcome avoidance, or do they develop alternative defensive strategies?
- **The destabilization threshold**: What determines which truths produce avoidance? Is there a threshold of threat-to-worldview beyond which avoidance kicks in?
- **Evolutionary history**: When did death-awareness and death-avoidance evolve? Are they co-emergent or did awareness precede avoidance?
- **Collective mechanisms**: How do cultures transmit and maintain avoidance patterns? How do they change?
