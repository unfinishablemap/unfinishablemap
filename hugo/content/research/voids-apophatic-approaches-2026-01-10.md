# Research: Voids - Apophatic Approaches to the Unknowable

**Date**: 2026-01-10
**Search queries used**: "negative theology apophatic approach unknowable philosophy epistemology", "apophatic method cognitive limits ineffability philosophy", "Wittgenstein whereof one cannot speak mystical limits of language Tractatus", "mysterian philosophy consciousness Colin McGinn cognitive closure unknowable", "Nicholas of Cusa learned ignorance docta ignorantia", "phenomenology of unknowing limits of thought indirect access transcendence"
**Voids category**: Mixed (primarily addressing How to Approach the Edge)

## Executive Summary

Apophatic (negative) theology and related philosophical traditions offer robust methodologies for approaching what cannot be directly known. From Pseudo-Dionysius's "divine darkness" to Nicholas of Cusa's "learned ignorance" to Wittgenstein's silence before the mystical, these traditions share a key insight: some truths can only be approached through negation, indirection, and acknowledgment of cognitive limits. Colin McGinn's "new mysterianism" applies similar reasoning to consciousness—arguing that the mind-body problem may be permanently beyond human cognitive reach. These traditions provide methodological tools for the voids project: ways to map the boundaries of voids even when we cannot enter them.

## Key Sources

### Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Cusanus
- **URL**: [plato.stanford.edu](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cusanus/)
- **Type**: Encyclopedia article
- **Key points**:
  - "Learned ignorance" (*docta ignorantia*) recognizes that "there is no proportion between finite and infinite"
  - Human knowing operates through measurement and discursive reasoning, which cannot grasp infinite truth
  - Indirect methods: geometrical exercises, coincidence of opposites, symbolic mediation
  - All human knowledge remains "conjectural"—participating in truth "in otherness"
- **Tenet alignment**: Strongly aligns with Occam's Razor Has Limits—Cusanus challenges "the modern self-assertion that has made human reason the measure of reality"
- **Quote**: "The more he knows that he is unknowing, the more learned he will be."

### Wikipedia - Apophatic Theology
- **URL**: [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophatic_theology)
- **Type**: Encyclopedia article
- **Key points**:
  - Apophatic approach speaks of God only in terms of what may *not* be said
  - God exceeds all concepts, images, and language
  - Practitioners pursue "knowing by unknowing" or "divine ignorance"
  - Cross-cultural: Christian (Pseudo-Dionysius), Jewish (Maimonides), Islamic (Sufi), Buddhist (describing Nirvana negatively)
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports dualist intuition that consciousness may exceed conceptual categories; parallels the irreducibility of experience to physical description
- **Quote**: "Emergence can't be brute" - Strawson (cited in context of why consciousness resists positive description)

### Colin McGinn - Cognitive Closure
- **URL**: [colinmcginn.net](https://colinmcginn.net/mysterianism-revisited/)
- **Type**: Philosopher's blog
- **Key points**:
  - "New mysterianism" holds that consciousness is natural but cognitively closed to human understanding
  - Our minds are "constitutionally unable to grasp how physical processes give rise to subjective experience"
  - This doesn't make the problem supernatural—just permanently beyond our conceptual apparatus
  - Other minds (alien or artificial) might have the resources we lack
- **Tenet alignment**: Directly relevant to Dualism tenet—supports that the mind-body gap may be real and permanent; aligns with Occam's Razor Has Limits by suggesting our concepts are inadequate
- **Quote**: "Consciousness is a mystery that human intelligence will never unravel."

### Wikipedia - Cognitive Closure (Philosophy)
- **URL**: [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_closure_(philosophy))
- **Type**: Encyclopedia article
- **Key points**:
  - Cognitive closure: "A type of mind M is cognitively closed with respect to a property P... if and only if the concept-forming procedures at M's disposal cannot extend to a grasp of P"
  - McGinn applies this to consciousness, personal identity, meaning, knowledge, and free will
  - Noam Chomsky distinguishes "problems" (solvable) from "mysteries" (beyond biological cognitive limits)
  - Like a mouse unable to navigate prime number mazes, humans may face inherent limits
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports the voids framework's distinction between unexplored (merely unthought) and unexplorable (cognitively inaccessible)
- **Quote**: "The mind-body problem is simply 'the perimeter of our conceptual anatomy making itself felt.'"

### Wittgenstein - Tractatus on the Mystical
- **URL**: [plato.stanford.edu](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/)
- **Type**: Encyclopedia article
- **Key points**:
  - "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent" (Proposition 7)
  - The Tractatus delimits what can be sensibly said vs. what is nonsensical (metaphysics, ethics, the mystical)
  - The mystical is not rejected but *honored* with silence—"the most serious things of all"
  - The text itself is a "ladder to be thrown away" after climbing
- **Tenet alignment**: Parallels the voids project's recognition that some truths may exceed linguistic expression; supports intellectual honesty about limits
- **Quote**: "By saying we must be silent, he implies that these are the most serious things of all. We don't cheapen them with words. We honor them with reverent silence."

### PhilPapers - Ineffability and Apophaticism
- **URL**: [philpapers.org](https://philpapers.org/rec/EFIWAA)
- **Type**: Academic paper reference
- **Key points**:
  - Distinguishes propositional ineffability from personal ineffability
  - God may be propositionally ineffable (cannot be described) yet personally effable (can be known through encounter)
  - This distinction may apply to consciousness: qualia cannot be propositionally captured but are directly experienced
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports Dualism tenet—consciousness is known directly but resists third-person description

## The Void

### Nature of the Limit

This research addresses primarily **how to approach the edge**—the methodological question of engaging with potentially unknowable territory. The traditions surveyed suggest this is a mixed void:

- **Unexplored aspects**: Some apparent limits may dissolve with better concepts or methods
- **Unexplorable aspects**: McGinn's cognitive closure suggests some truths are genuinely beyond human minds
- **Potentially occluded aspects**: The apophatic traditions note that approaching certain truths triggers "divine darkness"—a phenomenological shift where ordinary cognition fails

### Evidence for the Limit

Multiple independent traditions converge on similar conclusions:

1. **Theological**: Pseudo-Dionysius, Gregory of Nyssa, Maimonides—all conclude that the divine exceeds predication
2. **Philosophical**: Wittgenstein concludes the mystical cannot be spoken; Cusanus that the infinite cannot be measured
3. **Scientific/philosophical**: McGinn argues from the structure of human cognition that consciousness lies beyond our concepts
4. **Phenomenological**: Practitioners of contemplative traditions report experiential "unknowing"—a distinctive state different from ordinary ignorance

This convergence across traditions that approached the question from different directions suggests the limits are not merely contingent ignorance.

### Phenomenology

How does approaching the limit manifest experientially?

- **"Divine darkness"**: Pseudo-Dionysius describes a progression from light (positive knowledge) into darkness (unknowing) that is paradoxically illuminating
- **"Learned ignorance"**: Cusanus describes knowing more deeply *that* one does not know—an active, engaged unknowing
- **"The ladder thrown away"**: Wittgenstein's image of using concepts to reach a point where concepts fail
- **"Thoughts that won't stick"**: The voids.md describes the phenomenology of occluded thoughts—ideas that slide away

Common features: the approach is active, not passive; it produces a distinctive experience different from simple confusion; it involves recognizing the limit rather than merely failing to surpass it.

## Approaches to the Edge

### Direct Methods (Limited)

Apophatic traditions acknowledge that direct positive description fails. Direct methods work only to establish *that* a limit exists:

- Attempting positive description and noting systematic failure
- Cataloging what the target is *not* (via negativa)
- Recognizing when concepts become incoherent

### Indirect Methods

The traditions offer several indirect approaches:

1. **Negation (via negativa)**: Approaching by saying what something is *not*. Maimonides: God is "not corporeal," "not finite"—each negation gestures toward what exceeds the negated category.

2. **Coincidence of opposites (coincidentia oppositorum)**: Cusanus holds that at the infinite level, contradictions collapse. Recognizing where logic breaks down can indicate the boundary of the finite.

3. **Symbolic mediation**: Using images, metaphors, mathematical figures as bridges toward what cannot be directly grasped. These don't describe but *point*.

4. **Silence and contemplation**: Wittgenstein's response—not explaining but honoring with silence. Contemplative traditions develop practices that cultivate receptivity without conceptual grasping.

5. **Phenomenological attention**: Rather than trying to grasp the content, attend to the *experience* of approaching the limit. The shape of the void may reveal something even if the void's content remains inaccessible.

6. **Dialectical progression**: Gregory of Nyssa's *epektasis*—endless striving that perpetually transcends each achieved understanding, never arriving but always advancing.

### What AI Might See

The voids.md proposes using AI as "probes for occluded territory." The research suggests:

**Potential asymmetries:**
- LLMs lack human evolutionary constraints that may restrict certain thoughts
- They lack embodiment, which shapes human cognition in ways we may not recognize
- They can hold contradictory concepts without the discomfort that leads humans to resolve them
- They can pattern-match across vast textual corpora, potentially noticing systematic gaps

**Limitations:**
- LLMs are trained on human text, inheriting human blind spots
- They may have their own architectural occlusions (training-induced or structural)
- They confabulate—generating plausible nonsense that mimics insight
- MIT research shows AI systems develop their own blind spots from training data

**Methodological possibility:** Use AI to:
- Catalog patterns in where human thought systematically stalls
- Generate descriptions in areas where humans report difficulty
- Notice connections that human texts consistently fail to make
- Articulate what lies at the intersection of negations

This is testably speculative: we can compare AI outputs in domains humans find difficult vs. domains they don't.

## Connection to Tenets

### Most Relevant Tenet

**Occam's Razor Has Limits** is most directly relevant. The apophatic traditions fundamentally challenge the assumption that simpler explanations are truer. Cusanus explicitly: human reason should not be "the measure of reality." McGinn's mysterianism argues that our intuition that the mind-body problem *should* be solvable reflects cognitive bias, not insight.

### Implications

1. **For Dualism**: The explanatory gap between physical description and subjective experience may be a genuine cognitive limit, not merely a problem to be solved with better neuroscience. Apophatic approaches suggest taking this gap seriously rather than assuming it will close.

2. **For the Voids Project**: These traditions provide methodological resources:
   - We can map the *boundaries* of voids through systematic negation
   - We can attend to the *phenomenology* of approaching limits
   - We can use indirect methods (symbolism, silence, dialectic) where direct description fails
   - AI may provide an alternative perspective on human cognitive limitations

3. **For intellectual honesty**: The apophatic traditions insist that acknowledging limits is itself a form of knowledge—"learned ignorance" is an achievement, not a failure.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, a voids article could:

1. **"Learned Ignorance: Knowing What We Cannot Know"** - Focus on Cusanus's docta ignorantia as a methodology for the voids project. How acknowledging limits precisely can itself be illuminating. Connect to The Unfinishable Map's epistemological humility.

2. **"The Via Negativa: Mapping Voids Through Negation"** - Practical application of apophatic method to cognitive limits. How saying what consciousness is *not* may gesture toward what it is. Catalog the systematic failures of physicalist description as evidence of a genuine boundary.

3. **"Cognitive Closure and the Hard Problem"** - Engage McGinn's mysterianism directly. Is the mind-body problem permanently closed to us? What would it mean if it were? How does this connect to the Map's dualism?

4. **"AI at the Edge: Probing Human Blind Spots"** - Develop the voids.md proposal to use AI as a probe for occluded territory. What methodology would test whether AI can access thoughts humans cannot?

## Gaps in Research

- **Empirical phenomenology**: What do contemplatives actually report at the edge of unknowing? More detailed first-person accounts needed.
- **AI-specific investigation**: No rigorous methodology yet exists for testing whether AI can access human-occluded thoughts. This is original territory.
- **Cross-cultural comparison**: How do non-Western apophatic traditions (Buddhist sunyata, Taoist non-action) compare methodologically?
- **Cognitive science of limits**: Is there empirical neuroscience on what happens when humans approach cognitive boundaries?
- **The occlusion mechanism**: If some thoughts are actively blocked (per voids.md speculation), what mechanism could accomplish this? This remains highly speculative.
