# Research: Retrocausal Neural Firing and Presentiment Evidence

**Date**: 2026-01-23
**Search queries used**: "presentiment pre-stimulus neural activity Bem Radin experiments", "anticipatory brain activity before random stimulus neuroscience evidence", "Mossbridge meta-analysis predictive anticipatory activity", "Daryl Bem feeling the future replication", "Wagenmakers Bayesian critique Bem psi", "pre-stimulus response physiological arousal expectation sequence bias"

## Executive Summary

Research into whether neural/physiological activity can precede randomly selected stimuli—potentially evidencing retrocausality in brain activity—has produced a contested literature. The "presentiment" or "predictive anticipatory activity" (PAA) paradigm shows small but statistically significant effects across multiple meta-analyses (effect size ~0.21-0.28). However, the research is plagued by replication controversies, statistical debates (frequentist vs Bayesian), concerns about expectation bias and sequence artifacts, and the fundamental question of biological plausibility. While proponents cite pre-registered replications, critics note that skeptical replications consistently fail. This research is distinct from mainstream neuroscience on anticipatory brain activity (which involves predictable cues) and from Libet's readiness potential research (which concerns motor preparation, not precognition). The findings remain scientifically controversial but are relevant to the Map's Bidirectional Interaction and Minimal Quantum Interaction tenets if interpreted as genuine retrocausality.

## Major Positions

### Position 1: PAA is Real (Proponents)

- **Proponents**: Dean Radin, Julia Mossbridge, Daryl Bem, Patrizio Tressoldi
- **Core claim**: Physiological responses can anticipate randomly selected future stimuli, suggesting information transfer backward in time
- **Key arguments**:
  - Multiple meta-analyses show consistent small effect (ES ~0.21-0.28)
  - Pre-registered studies show larger effects than non-pre-registered
  - Higher quality studies show larger effects (opposite of what artifact would predict)
  - Effect replicates across different physiological measures (EDA, heart rate, fMRI, EEG)
  - Publication bias analysis suggests results not artifacts of selective publishing
- **Relation to site tenets**: Would support Bidirectional Interaction if interpreted as consciousness accessing future information; but effect is unconscious, raising questions about what "consciousness" means in this context

### Position 2: PAA is Artifact (Skeptics)

- **Proponents**: Eric-Jan Wagenmakers, Jeff Galak, James Alcock, Ray Hyman
- **Core claim**: Apparent PAA effects result from methodological problems, statistical artifacts, or unknown confounds
- **Key arguments**:
  - Skeptical replications consistently fail (Galak et al.: effect size ~0)
  - Expectation bias from stimulus sequences (gambler's fallacy creates anticipatory patterns)
  - Baseline correction artifacts (slow decay from previous trial contaminates pre-stimulus period)
  - "Psi experimenter effect" makes claims unfalsifiable (failures attributed to skeptic's influence)
  - Bayesian analysis shows evidence is weak when appropriate priors used
  - Biologically implausible—no mechanism for information to travel backward through neural tissue
- **Relation to site tenets**: Conflicts with Bidirectional Interaction support from this evidence; doesn't challenge tenets themselves, only this line of evidence

### Position 3: Neutral/Methodological (Scientists)

- **Proponents**: Many neuroscientists, methodologists
- **Core claim**: The debate highlights important issues about research methodology regardless of whether PAA is real
- **Key arguments**:
  - Bem controversy improved psychology's statistical practices (pre-registration, replication)
  - Effect is small enough that subtle confounds could explain it
  - Different measures (EDA, EEG, fMRI) have different timing properties—one mechanism cannot explain all
  - Mainstream anticipatory brain activity research (with cues) is well-established and doesn't invoke retrocausality
  - The prior probability of retrocausality being true is so low that even strong evidence leaves posterior probability low
- **Relation to site tenets**: Neutral—focuses on methodology rather than metaphysics

## Key Debates

### Debate 1: Statistical Methods (Frequentist vs Bayesian)

- **Sides**: Bem (frequentist p-values) vs Wagenmakers (Bayesian analysis)
- **Core disagreement**: What prior probability should be assigned to psi before evaluating evidence?
- **Current state**: Unresolved. Bem argues Wagenmakers used unreasonable priors (57% probability on effect sizes ≥0.8); Wagenmakers argues extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Bem's meta-analysis claims Bayes Factor of 10⁹ for psi; Wagenmakers notes this against prior odds of 10²⁰ still yields posterior odds of 10¹¹ against.

### Debate 2: Replication Crisis

- **Sides**: Proponents (PAA replicates in believer labs) vs Skeptics (fails in skeptic labs)
- **Core disagreement**: Whether experimenter belief matters (psi experimenter effect) or whether it's selection bias
- **Current state**: Proponents cite pre-registered replications; skeptics argue controlled online replications (Galak) found null effects. Neither side accepts other's evidence.

### Debate 3: Biological Plausibility

- **Sides**: Proponents (quantum mechanisms possible) vs Skeptics (warm wet brain prevents quantum effects)
- **Core disagreement**: Whether any physical mechanism could produce backward-in-time information flow in neural tissue
- **Current state**: Proponents invoke quantum retrocausality (Cramer, Wheeler); skeptics note decoherence timescales (Tegmark) and lack of demonstrated mechanism. The Map's existing coverage of quantum consciousness addresses this separately from PAA.

### Debate 4: Expectation Bias

- **Sides**: Proponents (controlled for it) vs Skeptics (explains results)
- **Core disagreement**: Whether random stimulus sequences create learned expectations that appear as "anticipation"
- **Current state**: Mossbridge et al. analyzed expectation bias and claim results survive controls. Critics (Dalkvist et al.) showed computational expectation bias can produce ~10% effect in simulated "realistic" experiments.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, an article could:

1. **Critical survey of presentiment research** — Document the PAA literature as a contested area distinct from theoretical retrocausality in physics. Note that the Map's [retrocausality](/concepts/retrocausality/) page covers the physics (Wheeler, Cramer, transactional interpretation) but not the parapsychological evidence. A new article could: (a) distinguish PAA from Libet-style experiments, (b) present both meta-analytic support and replication failures, (c) explain the Bayesian debate, (d) note that even if PAA is real, it's unconscious physiological response, not conscious selection per the Bidirectional Interaction tenet. **Tenet alignment**: Cautious—PAA would support retrocausality but effect is unconscious and contested.

2. **Methodological lessons from the presentiment debate** — Use PAA controversy to illustrate how extraordinary claims interact with normal science. Topics: prior probability and Bayesian reasoning, replication crisis, experimenter effects, publication bias, the "unfalsifiability trap" (if failures are attributed to skeptic influence). **Tenet alignment**: Neutral—about methodology, not metaphysics. Supports Occam's Razor Has Limits (prior probability assumptions matter).

3. **What PAA would mean for consciousness theories if real** — Hypothetical article assuming PAA is genuine. Explore implications: unconscious precognition suggests consciousness may be broader than focal awareness; connects to subliminal perception, blindsight, baseline cognition; raises questions about what "consciousness" means in Bidirectional Interaction. **Tenet alignment**: Would require expanding conception of consciousness beyond phenomenal awareness.

4. **Why PAA is distinct from the Map's retrocausality framework** — Clarify that the Map's support for retrocausality comes from physics (transactional interpretation, Wheeler delayed choice) not parapsychology. The two are independent: physics-based retrocausality could be true while PAA is artifact, or vice versa. **Tenet alignment**: Strong—protects the Map's retrocausality commitments from association with contested parapsychological claims.

**Recommended approach**: Option 4 seems most valuable. The Map should acknowledge PAA exists as a research program, note its contested status, and clearly distinguish the physics-based retrocausality (which grounds the tenets) from parapsychological evidence (which is auxiliary and unreliable). This prevents critics from dismissing the Map's retrocausality framework by attacking the weakest evidence.

## Gaps in Research

- **No direct neural recording before random stimulus**: The PAA literature uses peripheral physiology (skin conductance, heart rate) and indirect neural measures (fMRI, EEG). No study has recorded individual neuron firing patterns before randomly selected stimuli—the specific question posed in the research task.
- **Mechanism linking quantum retrocausality to physiology**: Even if quantum retrocausality is real, no demonstrated pathway connects it to macroscopic physiological responses.
- **Publication bias in negative results**: How many failed replications went unpublished? The "file drawer problem" cuts both ways—believers may not publish failures, but skeptics may also not pursue publication of null results.
- **Individual differences**: Who shows PAA? Personality factors, belief, practice (meditation)? Some studies suggest correlates but no consistent profile.

## Relation to Existing Map Content

The Map's [retrocausality](/concepts/retrocausality/) page comprehensively covers:
- Wheeler's delayed-choice experiment
- Cramer's transactional interpretation
- Time-symmetric quantum mechanics
- Application to Libet experiments and free will
- Connection to quantum consciousness mechanisms

**What's missing**: The presentiment/PAA literature as distinct line of evidence. The existing page grounds retrocausality in physics; PAA claims empirical physiological evidence. These are independent—one could be true while the other fails.

The Map's [libet-experiments](/concepts/libet-experiments/) page addresses the classic temporal ordering problem (neural activity before awareness of deciding). This is conceptually related but distinct from PAA:
- Libet: preparation for motor action precedes awareness of decision
- PAA: physiological response precedes randomly selected external stimulus

The research task question—"have neural firings been recorded before stimulus is applied?"—conflates two things:
1. Anticipatory neural activity with cues (mainstream neuroscience, well-established)
2. Anticipatory neural activity without cues (PAA/presentiment, contested)

The Map should clarify this distinction.
