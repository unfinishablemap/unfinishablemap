# Research: Panpsychism in Consciousness Studies

**Date**: 2026-01-08
**Search queries used**: "panpsychism consciousness Galen Strawson Philip Goff mind matter 2025", "Stanford Encyclopedia panpsychism"

## Executive Summary

Panpsychism holds that consciousness is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of reality—all matter has some experiential quality. Major proponents include Galen Strawson (who argues physicalism *entails* panpsychism) and Philip Goff (who emphasizes parsimony arguments). The main challenge is the "combination problem": how do micro-experiences combine into unified macro-consciousness? For the project's dualist framework, panpsychism presents an interesting comparison—both reject consciousness emerging from wholly non-conscious matter, but they differ on whether matter itself is experiential. the project's tenets may be compatible with a modified panpsychism where consciousness influences but isn't identical to all matter.

## Key Sources

### Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Panpsychism
- **URL**: [plato.stanford.edu](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/panpsychism/)
- **Type**: Encyclopedia article
- **Key points**:
  - Panpsychism resurgent since Nagel's 1979 article and Strawson's 2006 "Realistic Monism"
  - Main argument: consciousness can't intelligibly emerge from wholly non-conscious matter
  - Intrinsic nature argument: physics describes only dispositional properties, not what matter *is*
  - Combination problem: how do micro-conscious subjects combine into macro-conscious minds?
- **Tenet alignment**: Shares site's rejection of consciousness emerging from non-conscious; differs on whether all matter is experiential
- **Quote**: "Emergence can't be brute" - Strawson

### Strawson's "Realistic Monism" (2006)
- **URL**: [philpapers.org](https://philpapers.org/archive/STRMAB.pdf)
- **Type**: Academic paper
- **Key points**:
  - Physicalism entails panpsychism (surprising claim)
  - "The experiential considered specifically as such" is what it means for something to be physical
  - Panpsychism is "most ontologically parsimonious"—doesn't posit stuff beyond conscious experience
  - Calls Russell's approach "realistic physicalism"
- **Tenet alignment**: Conflicts with site's Dualism tenet (Strawson sees panpsychism as physicalism); aligns with taking consciousness seriously

### Philip Goff's Work
- **URL**: [amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Consciousness-Everywhere-Panpsychism-Journal-Studies/dp/1788360877)
- **Type**: Academic book
- **Key points**:
  - Simplicity argument: consciousness is our only clue to matter's intrinsic nature
  - Most parsimonious to assume consciousness-involving nature is universal
  - Acknowledges combination problem but sees it as less severe than emergence problem
  - Describes panpsychism as alternative to both physicalism and substance dualism
- **Tenet alignment**: Goff's positioning as alternative to dualism conflicts with site; his anti-emergence argument aligns

## Major Positions

### Position 1: Constitutive Panpsychism (Strawson)
- **Proponents**: Galen Strawson
- **Core claim**: Consciousness is constitutive of matter's fundamental nature; physicalism properly understood *is* panpsychism
- **Key arguments**:
  - Emergence from non-experiential to experiential is unintelligible
  - Panpsychism posits no new stuff—just says physical stuff is experiential
  - "Mass is energy; consciousness just is matter"
- **Relation to site tenets**: **Conflicts with Dualism.** Strawson's view is monist (one kind of stuff). Site holds consciousness is distinct from physical processes. However, both reject consciousness emerging from non-conscious matter.

### Position 2: Russellian Panpsychism (Goff, Chalmers)
- **Proponents**: Philip Goff, David Chalmers
- **Core claim**: Physics describes matter's extrinsic/dispositional properties; consciousness is its intrinsic nature
- **Key arguments**:
  - Physics tells us what matter *does*, not what it *is*
  - Since brains involve consciousness, simplest hypothesis: all matter involves consciousness
  - Avoids dualism's interaction problem (no separate substances)
- **Relation to site tenets**: **Partially conflicts.** Site's Bidirectional Interaction tenet implies consciousness influences physics—but Russellian panpsychism says consciousness *is* physics's intrinsic aspect, not a separate causal influence.

### Position 3: Cosmopsychism
- **Proponents**: Itay Shani, Philip Goff (recently)
- **Core claim**: The universe as a whole is conscious; individual minds are fragments or aspects
- **Key arguments**:
  - Avoids combination problem (top-down rather than bottom-up)
  - Universe's consciousness is fundamental; our consciousness derives from it
  - Supported by holism in quantum mechanics
- **Relation to site tenets**: **Partially aligns.** If universal consciousness selects quantum outcomes (per site's tenets), this resembles cosmopsychism. But site doesn't claim the universe is conscious—just that consciousness influences it.

### Position 4: Integrated Information Theory (Panpsychist Version)
- **Proponents**: Giulio Tononi
- **Core claim**: Consciousness = integrated information (phi); all systems with phi > 0 have some consciousness
- **Key arguments**:
  - Phi is measurable (in principle)
  - Explains why brains are conscious (high integration)
  - Implies protons have minimal consciousness
- **Relation to site tenets**: **Conflicts with No Many Worlds** (some IIT proponents accept MWI). The phi-is-consciousness equation also conflicts with site's emphasis on consciousness's irreducibility to information processing.

## Key Debates

### Debate 1: The Combination Problem
- **The problem**: If electrons have micro-experiences, how do they combine into unified human consciousness?
- **William James**: Individual conscious states are "shut in [their] own skin"—can't merge
- **Variants**:
  - Subject-summing: How do distinct subjects become one?
  - Palette problem: How do few micro-properties yield rich experience?
  - Structural mismatch: Why does consciousness have spatial structure if particles are discrete?
- **Panpsychist responses**:
  - Strawson: experiential-from-experiential emergence is less mysterious than experiential-from-non-experiential
  - Cosmopsychists: invert the problem (top-down, not bottom-up)
- **Relevance to site**: Site doesn't face this problem—doesn't claim all matter is conscious

### Debate 2: Is Panpsychism Really Physicalism?
- **Strawson's view**: Yes—properly understood physicalism *is* panpsychism
- **Goff's view**: No—panpsychism is alternative to both physicalism and dualism
- **Chalmers' view**: Panpsychism is a form of property dualism or neutral monism
- **Relevance to site**: Site's Dualism tenet distinguishes it from Strawson's version; closer to Goff's framing of panpsychism as distinct position

### Debate 3: Does Panpsychism Solve the Hard Problem?
- **Proponents claim**: Yes—consciousness doesn't emerge, it's fundamental
- **Critics respond**: Combination problem is just as hard as hard problem
- **Goff's response**: "Unintelligible experiential-from-experiential emergence is not nearly as bad as unintelligible experiential-from-non-experiential emergence"
- **Relevance to site**: Site agrees emergence is problematic; but solves it via dualism not panpsychism

## Connection to Site Tenets

### Dualism vs. Panpsychism
Site holds consciousness is *not reducible* to physical processes (Dualism tenet). Panpsychism (especially Strawson's version) holds consciousness *is* the physical—not reducible because already fundamental. Key difference:
- **Site**: Consciousness and matter are distinct (interact via Minimal Quantum Interaction)
- **Panpsychism**: Consciousness and matter are the same thing described differently

### Bidirectional Interaction
Site claims consciousness causally influences physical outcomes. Panpsychism (especially Russellian version) says consciousness is matter's intrinsic nature—not a separate causal influence. This is a genuine disagreement:
- **Site**: Consciousness selects among quantum possibilities (external influence)
- **Panpsychism**: Consciousness is what quantum events are "from the inside"

### Compatibility?
A modified position might work: consciousness is fundamental (agreeing with panpsychism) but not *identical* to all matter—rather, consciousness *interacts with* matter at fundamental level. This would be dualism that takes panpsychism's anti-emergence insight seriously without collapsing into monism.

## Potential Article Angles

1. **Panpsychism vs. Interactionist Dualism**: Compare the project's framework with panpsychism, showing they share the anti-emergence insight but differ on monism vs. dualism. Argue site's approach avoids combination problem while maintaining consciousness's causal efficacy.

2. **IIT and Site Tenets**: Analyze where Integrated Information Theory aligns (consciousness fundamental) and conflicts (phi = consciousness, potential MWI acceptance) with site's tenets.

3. **The Anti-Emergence Consensus**: Show how site agrees with panpsychism's core insight—consciousness can't emerge from non-conscious—while offering different solution.

## Gaps in Research

- More detail on Cosmopsychism and its relation to quantum holism
- Empirical predictions that might distinguish panpsychism from dualism
- How site's Minimal Quantum Interaction compares to Russellian intrinsic nature view
- Relationship between panpsychism and religious/spiritual traditions

## Suggested Follow-up Tasks

1. Write panpsychism vs. site perspective article
2. Research cosmopsychism specifically
3. Compare Strawson vs. Goff on whether panpsychism is physicalism
