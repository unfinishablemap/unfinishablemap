This research explores how The Unfinishable Map's implicit value theory—that conscious experience is the ground of intrinsic value—relates to established metaethical positions. The task originated from an external review noting that the Map "implicitly treats conscious experience as the ground of value" without explicitly locating this commitment in metaethics.

## The Map's Implicit Position

Across multiple pages, the Map presupposes a distinctive value theory:

**From [meaning-of-life](/topics/meaning-of-life/):**
- "Meaning is grounded in consciousness itself"
- "Conscious experience has intrinsic value"
- "Each moment of awareness is something rather than nothing, and that 'something' matters"
- "A beautiful sunset doesn't need to serve a divine plan to be beautiful. The experience of beauty is itself valuable."

**From [purpose-and-alignment](/topics/purpose-and-alignment/):**
- "What matters about humans is not the behavioural mapping but the conscious experience underlying it"
- "Two beings with identical input-output profiles might have radically different conscious lives—one rich with meaning, the other hollow"
- Preferences are "thin representations of values"

**From [tenets](/tenets/):**
- Dualism makes consciousness fundamental, not derivative
- Bidirectional Interaction gives consciousness causal efficacy
- These commitments support consciousness-grounded value

The position has a name in contemporary metaethics: **phenomenal value realism** or, in its hedonistic variant, **analytic hedonism**.

## Phenomenal Value Realism

Sharon Hewitt Rawlette's *The Feeling of Value* (2016) develops the most systematic defense. Her core claim: intrinsic goodness is an experiential property—a quality of conscious experience itself.

### The Central Thesis

"When we feel pleasure, we are feeling intrinsic goodness itself." Pleasantness and intrinsic goodness are not merely correlated—they are identical. The positive phenomenal quality of joy, satisfaction, or pleasure just *is* what we mean by "intrinsically good." Similarly, the negative phenomenal quality of suffering just *is* what we mean by "intrinsically bad."

This is stronger than the claim that pleasure causes value or indicates value. It's an identity claim: to be pleasant *is* to be intrinsically valuable.

### The Is-Ought Bridge

Rawlette argues this dissolves the traditional is-ought gap. Hume famously argued you cannot derive "ought" from "is"—normative conclusions from descriptive premises. But if some experiential qualities are simultaneously descriptive (they're how experiences feel) and normative (they're what intrinsic goodness is), then normativity exists within the empirical world.

She calls this **analytic hedonism**: "positive and negative qualities of conscious experience are intrinsically good and bad *by definition*." The claim is analytic—true in virtue of what we mean by these terms—not synthetic (discovered empirically).

### Key Arguments

**Coherence test**: "Pleasant feelings are intrinsically bad" would be incoherent—it would suggest the speaker means something different by "pleasant" than we do.

**Functional role of pain**: Pain's badness appears essential to its function as a motivator. It needs to be intrinsically aversive to do what it does.

**Agent-neutral presentation**: Our experiences present themselves as having value independent of whose experience they are. My pain doesn't present itself as bad-for-me-specifically; it presents as bad simpliciter.

**Neural commonality**: Research shows shared neural pathways across different pleasure and pain types, suggesting a unified phenomenal quality underlying valence.

### Relation to the Map

The Map's position resembles Rawlette's but extends beyond hedonism. The Map doesn't restrict intrinsic value to pleasure/pain; it gestures toward broader features:

- **Meaning** in engagement (not reducible to pleasure)
- **Agency** in making choices (valuable even when difficult)
- **Understanding** (intellectually satisfying insight)
- **Connection** (valuable relationships)

This suggests a modified view: **phenomenal value pluralism**—multiple features of conscious experience have intrinsic value, not just hedonic valence.

## Welfarism vs. Objective List Theory

The Map's position must navigate between major theories of well-being:

### Hedonism (Simple Welfarism)

Only pleasure is intrinsically good; only pain is intrinsically bad. Well-being consists entirely in the balance of pleasant over unpleasant experiences.

**Problem for the Map**: The meaning-of-life article claims that "authentic choice" and "connection with what matters" are valuable even when not pleasant. The Map seems committed to more than hedonic value.

### Desire Satisfaction Theory

What's good for you is getting what you want. Well-being consists in desire fulfillment.

**Problem for the Map**: The purpose-and-alignment article explicitly rejects this—preferences are "unreliable guides to our own good." Evolution shaped preferences for survival, not flourishing. The Map cannot ground value in desire.

### Objective List Theory

Multiple things are intrinsically good: pleasure, knowledge, friendship, achievement, autonomy, aesthetic appreciation. These are good regardless of whether you want them or find them pleasant.

**Problem for the Map**: Standard objective list theory doesn't privilege consciousness. The list items are good independently of being experienced. But the Map claims value is grounded *in* conscious experience—not just correlated with it.

### The Map's Synthesis

The Map occupies a distinctive position:

1. **Experience-constrained objectivism**: Value is objective (not reducible to preference) but exists only in conscious experience. Nothing has value outside experience.

2. **Phenomenal pluralism**: Multiple features of experience are intrinsically valuable—not just hedonic tone, but also meaning, agency, understanding, connection. But all are phenomenal features of consciousness.

3. **Anti-preference**: Preferences don't track value well. What matters is the quality of experience, which may diverge from what we prefer.

4. **Consciousness-primacy**: Value requires a subject for whom things matter. Without consciousness, value cannot exist. This distinguishes the position from abstract objective list theories.

## Locating the View in Metaethics

### Moral Realism

The Map is committed to some form of moral realism: there are objective facts about value, not just subjective preferences. Consciousness grounds these facts.

The view is **non-natural moral realism**: moral properties (intrinsic goodness) are real but not reducible to physical properties. This fits with the Map's dualism—consciousness is not reducible to physics, and value (grounded in consciousness) inherits this irreducibility.

Alternatively, the view might be **analytic naturalism**: moral properties are identical to natural properties (experiential qualities), but this identity is conceptual, not discovered empirically. This is Rawlette's position.

### Against Error Theory

Error theory holds all moral claims are false because nothing has value. The Map's response: consciousness exists, and its qualitative character constitutes value. Error theory must deny that pleasure is good—but this seems to misunderstand what "good" means.

### Against Non-Cognitivism

Non-cognitivism holds moral claims don't state facts; they express attitudes. The Map's response: the claim "suffering is bad" is not merely an expression of my dislike of suffering. It states something objectively true about the phenomenal quality of suffering.

### Against Constructivism

Constructivism holds value is constructed through rational procedures (Rawls) or evolves through social practices (Korsgaard). The Map's response: value is discovered in experience, not constructed by reason or society. Consciousness was valuable before humans developed moral frameworks.

## What Makes the View Distinctive

The Map's implicit metaethics has several unusual features:

### Experience Requirement

Nothing can be valuable unless experienced. This rules out:
- Value in unconscious states
- Value "for" non-conscious entities
- Abstract goods that no one experiences

The classic test case is the "experience machine" (Nozick): would you plug into a machine that gives perfect experiences? Hedonists say yes; objective list theorists say no (you miss "real" achievement, knowledge, etc.).

The Map's position is intermediate: what matters is the *quality of experience*, not whether experiences are "real" in some external sense. But it might reject the experience machine if the simulated experiences lack certain phenomenal qualities—perhaps genuine agency or authentic connection require real-world engagement to feel a certain way.

### Dualism Connection

Value realism is often defended on non-dualist assumptions. But the Map's dualism adds a distinctive wrinkle: if consciousness is fundamental (not reducible to physics), then value (grounded in consciousness) is equally fundamental. Value isn't an overlay on physical reality—it's built into the fabric of what fundamentally exists.

This gives value ontological gravity that purely physicalist value realism lacks.

### Indexical Value

The Map's emphasis on indexical identity ([haecceity](/concepts/haecceity/)) extends to value. *This* experience matters—not just experiences-of-this-type. Your particular conscious life has value that couldn't be replicated by a qualitatively identical duplicate.

This is unusual. Most value theories treat value as type-based: pleasure is good, suffering is bad, regardless of who experiences it. The Map suggests token-based value: *this* particular experience, happening to *this* particular subject, has unique significance.

## Challenges to Address

### The Scope Problem

If only conscious experience has value, what about:
- **Ecosystem value**: Do forests matter only when experienced?
- **Historical value**: Does the past matter only in present memory?
- **Future generations**: Do not-yet-conscious beings matter?

Possible responses:
- Forests matter because conscious beings experience them (anthropocentric)
- Forests matter because they contain conscious beings (sentientist)
- Forests matter because destroying them reduces future conscious value (consequentialist)

### The Richness Problem

What exactly makes experience valuable? the Map mentions:
- Valence (pleasure/pain)
- Richness (complexity, depth)
- Unity (coherence of experience)
- Agency (sense of authorship)
- Narrative (meaningful structure)
- Attention (quality of presence)

But how do these trade off? Is a rich painful experience more or less valuable than a simple pleasant one? the Map hasn't specified.

### The AI Problem

If AI systems lack consciousness (as the Map claims), they lack intrinsic value on this view. But do they have instrumental value? Can they promote or diminish conscious value? The purpose-and-alignment article touches this: AI should support human inquiry into meaning, not optimize for preferences.

## Recommendations for the Map

1. **Make the commitment explicit**: Create a concept page on "phenomenal value realism" or "consciousness-grounded value" that states the metaethical position clearly.

2. **Distinguish from hedonism**: the Map's view is not pure hedonism—multiple features of experience matter. Articulate which features and how they relate.

3. **Address the scope problem**: What has value besides human conscious experience? Animals? AI? Ecosystems? the Map discusses animal consciousness but doesn't fully address value implications.

4. **Connect to welfarism debates**: Position the view relative to objective list theories and desire satisfaction theories. The Map rejects preference-tracking; how does it handle objective goods that aren't experienced?

5. **Engage critics**: G.E. Moore's "Open Question Argument" challenges analytic reductions of goodness. Rawlette has responses; the Map could engage.

## Conclusion

The Map implicitly holds **phenomenal value pluralism**: intrinsic value is grounded in features of conscious experience (not just hedonic valence), value is objective (not preference-dependent), and value requires subjects for whom things matter (no consciousness, no value). This position is coherent and defensible but underarticulated. Making it explicit would strengthen the Map's philosophical foundations and clarify the AI alignment implications that motivate the discussion.
