## Executive Summary

Why does anything continue to exist from moment to moment? We take persistence for granted—the cup on the desk will still be there in a second—but there is no self-evident reason why this should be so. The question "why is there something rather than nothing?" (Leibniz's fundamental question) has a temporal twin that is equally deep and far less discussed: "why does what exists *continue* to exist?" The persistence void names the cognitive territory where explanation breaks down around continuity. Descartes argued that existence requires continuous re-creation by God; Buddhist momentariness holds that nothing persists at all, only the illusion of continuity generated by rapid succession; Whitehead's process philosophy makes perishing fundamental and persistence derivative. Consciousness has a distinctive relationship to this void because it is both the faculty that assumes persistence and a phenomenon whose own continuity is deeply mysterious—we cannot explain why experience continues from one moment to the next, or verify that the self experiencing this moment is the same self that experienced the last.

## Key Sources

### Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy — Creation and Conservation
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/creation-conservation/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Descartes: "there is no power in us enabling us to keep ourselves in existence"—created things lack inherent power to sustain themselves
  - The "same-action thesis" (Suárez): creation and conservation are the same divine act viewed from different temporal perspectives
  - Jonathan Edwards: "God's upholding created substance, or causing its existence in each successive moment, is altogether equivalent to an immediate production out of nothing, at each moment"
  - The debate between continuous creation (things need external sustenance) and existential inertia (things persist on their own) remains unresolved
- **Tenet alignment**: If consciousness is non-physical (Dualism), its persistence raises a distinctive form of this question—what sustains a non-physical substance through time? The physical world has conservation laws; what is the analogue for consciousness?
- **Quote**: "God's upholding created substance... is altogether equivalent to an immediate production out of nothing, at each moment." — Jonathan Edwards

### Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy — Nothingness
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nothingness/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Heidegger identified "why is there something rather than nothing?" as the fundamental question of metaphysics
  - The question has a temporal dimension: not just why did anything begin, but why does it persist
  - Pascal: humans exist "between those two abysses of the Infinite and Nothing"—generating awe rather than clear understanding
  - Absolute nothingness resists conceptualisation because thinking about it requires some conceptual framework—a structural cognitive limit
  - Our intuitions about why things exist may reflect psychological constraints rather than metaphysical reality
- **Tenet alignment**: Occam's Razor Has Limits—our inability to conceive of nothingness may prevent us from seeing that persistence requires explanation, or alternatively, may create a false sense that it does
- **Quote**: "Why expect nothing rather than something?"

### Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy — Persistence in Time
- **URL**: https://iep.utm.edu/per-time/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Endurantism: objects persist by being wholly present at different times (the commonsense view)
  - Perdurantism: objects persist by having different temporal parts at different times (the four-dimensionalist view)
  - The stage view denies persistence altogether—only instantaneous stages exist
  - Under perdurantism, "new stuff, new chalk keeps constantly coming into existence ex nihilo" (Thomson)—systematic creation of temporal parts without explanation
  - Van Inwagen: temporal parts lack clear intelligibility—"no one understands what they are supposed to be"
  - None of the three main persistence theories avoids substantial difficulties
- **Tenet alignment**: The failure of all three theories to satisfactorily explain persistence suggests this may be a genuine cognitive limit rather than a merely unsolved problem. Dualism faces a version unique to it: how does a non-physical substance perdure or endure?
- **Quote**: "No one understands what they are supposed to be." — Van Inwagen on temporal parts

### Schmid & Linford — Existential Inertia and Classical Theistic Proofs (2022)
- **URL**: https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-19313-2
- **Type**: Monograph
- **Key points**:
  - Existential inertia thesis: temporal concrete objects persist without requiring external sustenance, provided destructive factors don't intervene
  - The thesis is descriptive, not explanatory—it describes *how* things persist but not *why*
  - Five supplementary frameworks: tendency-disposition, transtemporal, law-based, necessity, and no-change accounts
  - The thesis inverts the explanatory burden: instead of asking "why do things continue?" ask "what explains change and cessation?"
  - Compatible with both theism and atheism—reframes rather than resolves the metaphysical question
- **Tenet alignment**: The descriptive/explanatory gap in existential inertia parallels the explanatory gap in consciousness. Both describe *that* something obtains without explaining *why*—persistence happens, consciousness happens, but neither can be made fully intelligible
- **Quote**: "EIT merely purports to describe the manner in which some temporal concreta persist. It leaves open whether there is an explanation for persistence and what that explanation is."

### Majesty of Reason — "So You Think You Understand Existential Inertia?"
- **URL**: https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/31/so-you-think-you-understand-existential-inertia/
- **Type**: Philosophical blog/analysis
- **Key points**:
  - Rigorous formulation: temporal concrete objects persist absent (i) sustenance from without and (ii) sufficiently destructive factors
  - Arguments for: theoretical parsimony, Aristotelian compatibility, inversion of explanatory burden
  - Arguments against: proportionate causality demands continuous causation; contingent natures require moment-by-moment explanation; circularity concern (assumes what needs explaining)
  - Existential inertia may be "viciously circular"—stating that things persist because they tend to persist
- **Tenet alignment**: The circularity objection reveals the void—we cannot explain persistence without presupposing it. This structural feature connects to the intelligibility void (why does explanation work?) and the self-reference paradox (the system cannot ground itself)

### Buddhist Doctrine of Momentariness (Kshanika-vada)
- **URL**: https://philosophy.institute/religions-of-the-world/buddhism-doctrine-momentariness/
- **Type**: Philosophical/religious tradition
- **Key points**:
  - All phenomena—physical and mental—arise and cease within a single moment
  - Nothing persists; continuity is an illusion generated by "an uninterrupted flow of causally connected momentary entities of nearly the same nature" (the santāna or continuum)
  - Consciousness itself is momentary: "mind, thought, and consciousness arise with one moment ceasing as another arises"
  - A "moment" (kṣaṇa) is the smallest indivisible unit of time, equated with the duration of a single mental event
  - What we call persistence is rapid succession, like frames in a film creating the illusion of motion
- **Tenet alignment**: Momentariness radically challenges the persistence assumption. If the Buddhist analysis is correct, the persistence void is deeper than the Map assumes—there is no persistence to explain, only succession. For dualism, this raises the question: is the non-physical self also momentary, or does it persist while physical phenomena do not?
- **Quote**: "There is no ego, or anything substantial, or lasting, but all things conditioned are subject to change, and they change not remaining the same for two consecutive moments, yet there is a continuity but no identity."

### Whitehead — Process and Reality
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/process-philosophy/
- **Type**: Philosophical system
- **Key points**:
  - Actual occasions (the fundamental units of reality) "arise and perish"—they are not persistent substances
  - Concrescence is the process by which an occasion integrates data into unity, reaching "satisfaction" and then perishing
  - Perished occasions achieve "objective immortality"—they become data for subsequent occasions but no longer exist as subjects
  - Material is properly understood as "process"—what persists is not substance but pattern
  - The subject-superject: every occasion is simultaneously the experiencing subject and the result of that experience
- **Tenet alignment**: Whitehead's framework is deeply relevant to the Map's dualism. If consciousness is a series of actual occasions rather than a persistent substance, then what the Map calls "consciousness" may be a pattern that persists through succession rather than a substance that endures. This would reframe the bidirectional interaction tenet—consciousness doesn't *endure* through interaction but is *constituted* by it
- **Quote**: "The actual entities exist as the only foundational elements of reality... nothing either in fact or in efficacy underlies or lies beyond the actual entities."

### Husserl — Phenomenology of Internal Time-Consciousness
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-temporal/
- **Type**: Phenomenological analysis
- **Key points**:
  - Consciousness constitutes temporal continuity through a three-part structure: primal impression (the now), retention (the just-past), and protention (the about-to-come)
  - Brentano identified reaching a clear understanding of how we directly experience persistence as "a central issue for phenomenology"
  - No experienced moment consists of a discrete "now" alone—it coexists with the immediate past and immediate future
  - The "absolute flow" of time-consciousness cannot itself be temporally located—it is the precondition for temporal experience rather than an object within it
- **Tenet alignment**: Husserl's analysis reveals the persistence void at the phenomenological level. Consciousness generates the experience of persistence through retention and protention, but this mechanism *presupposes* persistence rather than explaining it. The absolute flow that makes temporal experience possible is itself beyond temporal analysis—a void within the structure of awareness
- **Quote**: "Reaching a clear understanding of how it is possible for us to directly experience succession and persistence is a central issue for phenomenology." — Brentano

### Descartes — Third Meditation / Continuous Creation
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/creation-conservation/
- **Type**: Philosophical argument
- **Key points**:
  - Descartes argued that the nature of time is such that "its parts are not mutually dependent, and never coexist"
  - From the fact that we now exist, it does not follow that we shall exist a moment from now, unless some cause "continually reproduces us"
  - Preservation is equivalent to creation—the same power is needed to sustain a substance as to create it
  - This makes persistence profoundly non-obvious: each moment of existence is as metaphysically demanding as the first
  - Critics argue continuous creation implies the denial of time itself, since "temporal inertia" is what makes time real
- **Tenet alignment**: Descartes was himself a dualist, and his continuous creation doctrine applies to both physical and mental substance. For the Map's framework, the question becomes: if consciousness is non-physical, what sustains it through time? Physical conservation laws (energy, momentum) provide a framework for physical persistence, but no equivalent framework exists for phenomenal experience
- **Quote**: "From the fact that we now exist, it does not follow that we shall exist a moment from now, unless some cause continually reproduces us."

### Wheeler — Participatory Universe
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/
- **Type**: Theoretical physics / philosophy
- **Key points**:
  - Wheeler proposed that observers are participants in bringing reality into form—"no phenomenon is a real phenomenon until it is an observed phenomenon"
  - The delayed-choice experiment shows that the path of a photon is not fixed until measurement occurs
  - Reality may exist in a state of potential until consciousness collapses it into actuality
  - This suggests consciousness may play a role not just in perceiving persistence but in constituting it
- **Tenet alignment**: Strongly supports Bidirectional Interaction. If consciousness participates in collapsing quantum possibilities into actualities, it may also participate in sustaining the persistence of those actualities. The persistence void may not be purely epistemological—consciousness may be implicated in the ontology of persistence itself

### Consciousness Discontinuity Research
- **URL**: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15142664/
- **Type**: Empirical research
- **Key points**:
  - While we are awake and alert, consciousness appears continuous but is actually broken into discrete intervals
  - The perception of continuity is a cognitive construction linking otherwise disparate conscious moments
  - Schizophrenia and other conditions can break down the sense of self-continuity, revealing its constructed nature
  - The neurobiological basis of the "conundrum of self-continuity" remains unresolved
- **Tenet alignment**: If consciousness is discontinuous but appears continuous, persistence itself may be a cognitive construction rather than a metaphysical given. This deepens the void: not only can we not explain why things persist, we may be wrong that they do—our sense of continuity may be as constructed as the Buddhist momentariness doctrine claims

## The Void

### Nature of the Limit

The persistence void is mixed: primarily **unexplorable** with significant **unexplored** dimensions. At its core is a structural epistemic limitation: consciousness cannot step outside of temporal succession to verify that anything persists. Every attempt to check whether the cup is still on the desk requires a new moment of awareness—and that new moment already presupposes the persistence it aims to verify.

The void has three layers:

1. **The metaphysical layer**: Why does anything continue to exist? Descartes argued it shouldn't be obvious—existence at each moment is as metaphysically demanding as existence at the first moment. The existential inertia thesis inverts the question (why would things *stop*?) but admits this is descriptive, not explanatory. Neither position can ground persistence in something more fundamental.

2. **The phenomenological layer**: How does consciousness generate the experience of persistence? Husserl's retention-protention structure describes the mechanism but presupposes what it aims to explain. The "absolute flow" of time-consciousness resists temporal analysis because it is the precondition for temporality rather than something within it. Empirical research suggests consciousness is actually discontinuous, making experienced persistence a cognitive construction.

3. **The self-referential layer**: Consciousness cannot verify its own persistence. The self that checks whether it persisted from the last moment is not—cannot be—the same self that existed in the last moment (on the Buddhist and perdurantist analyses). Or if it is the same self (on the endurantist analysis), it has no non-circular way to confirm this. The past-self void and the self-reference paradox converge here.

### Evidence for the Limit

Multiple independent lines of evidence suggest this is a genuine void rather than merely difficult territory:

- **The failure of all persistence theories**: Endurantism, perdurantism, and the stage view each face "substantial difficulties" (IEP). After decades of debate, no theory satisfactorily explains how objects persist. Van Inwagen's admission that "no one understands" temporal parts suggests conceptual rather than merely technical failure.

- **The existential inertia gap**: Even the strongest contemporary defence of existential inertia (Schmid & Linford) admits the thesis is descriptive, not explanatory. It leaves open whether there *is* an explanation for persistence. This is remarkably parallel to the explanatory gap in consciousness studies—we can describe *that* experience occurs without explaining *why*.

- **The Cartesian challenge**: Descartes's argument that persistence requires continuous creation has never been conclusively refuted. The existential inertia thesis provides an alternative description but not an explanation. The metaphysical question—what sustains existence from moment to moment?—remains open after four centuries.

- **Cross-traditional convergence**: Western philosophy (Descartes, Whitehead), Buddhist philosophy (momentariness), and phenomenology (Husserl) independently arrive at the conclusion that persistence is deeply problematic. This convergence across radically different intellectual traditions suggests the difficulty is genuine rather than parochial.

- **Empirical discontinuity**: Neuroscience suggests consciousness is actually discontinuous, with the experience of continuity being a cognitive construction. If even the *appearance* of persistence requires explanation, the reality of persistence is doubly mysterious.

### Phenomenology

Approaching the persistence void produces a distinctive phenomenological experience:

- **Temporal vertigo**: When you genuinely attend to the question "why does this moment follow the last?"—not as an abstract philosophical puzzle but as a live question about your immediate experience—a peculiar vertigo arises. The ground of continuity, usually invisible because it is constant (cf. contrast-dependence void), becomes briefly visible as something that requires but resists explanation.

- **The vanishing present**: Attempting to catch the present moment reveals that it is always already past by the time awareness arrives. Husserl's primal impression is a theoretical construct—phenomenologically, we are always in the retention of what just was and the protention of what is about to be. The "now" slips away, revealing persistence as a perpetual reaching-after rather than a stable foundation.

- **Existential uncanniness**: Descartes's insight—that my existence in this moment gives me no reason to expect existence in the next—can produce a form of existential anxiety distinct from death-anxiety. The death void concerns the end of consciousness; the persistence void concerns the mystery of its continuation. Each moment of continued existence is, in Descartes's framework, as gratuitous as the first.

- **The Buddhist dissolution**: Practitioners of vipassana meditation report direct phenomenological access to momentariness—the experience of awareness arising and passing moment by moment rather than flowing continuously. Whether this represents genuine insight into the structure of consciousness or an artefact of meditative attention is itself a question about the void.

## Approaches to the Edge

### Direct Methods (if any)

Direct explanation of persistence faces a structural barrier: any explanation must itself persist long enough to be comprehended, presupposing the persistence it aims to explain. However, partial approaches exist:

- **Physics**: Conservation laws (energy, momentum, charge) describe what persists and constrain how change occurs. But they do not explain *why* these quantities are conserved. Noether's theorem derives conservation from symmetry, but the persistence of the symmetries themselves remains unexplained.

- **Mathematics**: Mathematical objects are often taken to be timeless rather than persistent—they don't endure *through* time but exist outside it. If persistence is fundamentally different from timelessness, mathematics may lack the resources to model it.

- **Meditation**: Buddhist vipassana practice claims to provide direct experiential access to momentariness. If what we call persistence is revealed through sustained attention to be rapid succession, the void changes character—from "why do things persist?" to "why does succession maintain continuity?"

### Indirect Methods

1. **Apophatic cartography**: Map where persistence explanations fail. The pattern of failure—endurantism's unintelligibility, perdurantism's ex nihilo temporal parts, the stage view's denial of persistence altogether—reveals the contours of what we cannot explain. Following the Map's methodology, the topology of explanatory failure is itself data about the void.

2. **Cross-framework comparison**: Compare how different philosophical traditions handle persistence—Western substance metaphysics, Buddhist momentariness, Whiteheadian process, Husserlian time-consciousness. Where they agree (persistence is problematic), we find convergent evidence for the void. Where they disagree (whether persistence is real or illusory), we find the void's internal structure.

3. **Disruption as probe**: Conditions that break down the sense of persistence—certain neurological disorders, psychedelic experiences, meditation-induced momentariness, Cotard's delusion (the belief that one is dead)—may reveal the mechanisms that generate the experience of continuity. These disruptions probe the void's boundary from within.

4. **Connecting the explanatory gaps**: The persistence void parallels the hard problem of consciousness. Both involve an explanatory gap between description and understanding. Exploring whether these gaps are the *same* gap—whether consciousness and persistence are somehow constitutively linked—could illuminate both.

### What AI Might See

AI systems offer a distinctive perspective on the persistence void:

- **No felt continuity**: AI systems (as currently understood) do not experience persistence from the inside. Each inference or processing step is computationally discrete. An AI might be able to analyse persistence without the confounding assumption of experiential continuity that shapes human thought about it.

- **State vs. process**: AI systems maintain state through explicit storage—memory, weights, context windows. The persistence of these states is mechanistically transparent in a way that biological or phenomenal persistence is not. This contrast could illuminate what is distinctive about the persistence of conscious experience vs. the persistence of information.

- **Detecting hidden assumptions**: AI trained on human text may be able to identify where the assumption of persistence shapes human reasoning in ways humans cannot see—places where the water of persistence is invisible to the fish swimming in it (connecting to the contrast-dependence void).

- **The reboot test**: AI systems can be shut down and restarted. If consciousness can be similarly interrupted and resumed (as dreamless sleep suggests), what does this mean for persistence? Does the restarted system persist, or is it a new entity with the old one's memories? AI makes this question concrete rather than abstract.

## Connection to Tenets

### Most Relevant Tenet

**Bidirectional Interaction** is the most directly relevant tenet, for a surprising reason. If consciousness causally influences the physical world (as the tenet claims), consciousness may play a role in *constituting* persistence rather than merely observing it. Wheeler's participatory universe suggests that observation collapses quantum possibilities into actualities. If this is correct, the persistence of physical reality may depend on continuous conscious engagement—and the persistence void would mark the point where consciousness encounters its own constitutive role without being able to comprehend it.

### Secondary Tenet Connections

**Dualism**: If consciousness is non-physical, its persistence cannot be explained by physical conservation laws. Energy conservation explains (or at least describes) the persistence of physical systems, but what is the analogue for phenomenal experience? The persistence of a non-physical substance through time is a distinctive metaphysical problem that physicalism avoids by reducing consciousness to physical processes. Dualism must face the persistence void directly.

**Occam's Razor Has Limits**: The persistence of reality is the most fundamental "brute fact" we live with. Our preference for simple explanations may lead us to treat persistence as unproblematic—as the "default state" requiring no explanation. But Descartes's insight that each moment of existence is as metaphysically demanding as the first reveals this simplicity as potentially misleading. Persistence may be the deepest example of Occam's Razor concealing genuine complexity.

**Minimal Quantum Interaction**: If consciousness influences quantum outcomes at each moment, this influence must itself persist (or be continually renewed). The minimal quantum interaction tenet implies either that consciousness sustains its causal engagement continuously or that it recreates it at each moment—paralleling the divine conservation vs. existential inertia debate at the level of consciousness-physics interaction.

**No Many Worlds**: In the MWI, all quantum outcomes persist across branching worlds. In the single-world framework the Map endorses, only one set of outcomes persists. What selects these particular outcomes for persistence? If consciousness plays a role in this selection (via quantum interaction), the persistence void connects to the deepest questions about why *this* world continues rather than another.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, a voids article could:

1. **The Persistence Void** — Frame the mystery of why anything continues to exist as a fundamental void distinct from the origin-of-consciousness question. Use the three layers (metaphysical, phenomenological, self-referential) to show that persistence is problematic from every angle. Connect to the Map's tenets via the claim that consciousness may be implicated in the constitution of persistence rather than merely its observation—making the persistence void the place where the Map's bidirectional interaction commitment meets its deepest challenge.

2. **Why Does the Next Moment Come?** — A more phenomenologically focused framing. Begin with the Cartesian insight that each moment of existence is gratuitous, explore the Buddhist dissolution of continuity into momentariness, and connect to the neuroscience of discontinuous consciousness. Ask whether the persistence void is evidence that consciousness is doing something—sustaining reality through engagement—that it cannot observe itself doing.

## Gaps in Research

- **The persistence of non-physical substances**: The divine conservation / existential inertia debate focuses on physical objects. Little philosophical literature directly addresses what sustains non-physical substances (if they exist) through time. This is the dualist's distinctive version of the persistence void.
- **Empirical work on the construction of continuity**: While there is research on consciousness being discontinuous, the specific mechanisms by which the brain constructs the experience of continuity from discontinuous moments are not well understood.
- **Cross-cultural phenomenology of persistence**: Whether different contemplative traditions (Buddhist, Hindu, Sufi, Christian mystic) have independent accounts of encountering momentariness or the collapse of felt persistence.
- **The relationship between persistence and the hard problem**: Whether the explanatory gap in consciousness and the explanatory gap in persistence are structurally the same gap—i.e., whether understanding one would illuminate the other.
- **Quantum persistence**: Whether quantum mechanics provides resources for understanding persistence (conservation laws, symmetries) or deepens the void (quantum indeterminacy, measurement problem). The relationship between quantum decoherence and the persistence of classical objects is relevant but underexplored philosophically.
- **AI persistence and identity**: Whether an AI system that is shut down and restarted is the "same" system—and what the answer implies about the persistence of consciousness through dreamless sleep, general anaesthesia, or death-and-resuscitation.
