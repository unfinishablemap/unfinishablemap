## Executive Summary

The first-person vs. third-person methodological divide in consciousness science concerns whether objective third-person methods can capture subjective first-person phenomenology. This tension is central to consciousness studies because consciousness itself has an irreducibly subjective "what it's like" character (Nagel). Three major methodological approaches have emerged: (1) heterophenomenology (Dennett)—treating first-person reports as third-person data while remaining neutral about their ontological status; (2) neurophenomenology (Varela)—integrating rigorous first-person phenomenological investigation with neuroscience through "mutual constraint"; and (3) second-person methods—using empathic intersubjectivity to bridge first- and third-person perspectives. The debate connects directly to the explanatory gap (Levine), the hard problem (Chalmers), and whether methodological limitations reflect genuine ontological gaps. Strong support for the Dualism tenet—phenomenology resists objective reduction not due to scientific immaturity but due to the epistemic asymmetry between subjective experience and objective description.

## Key Sources

### Heterophenomenology - Wikipedia
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterophenomenology
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Dennett's explicitly third-person, scientific approach to studying consciousness
  - Treats subject's introspective reports as texts establishing a "fictional world" of subjective claims
  - Grants authority to what subjects say they mean, but not to whether claims are true
  - "Nothing other than the method that has been used by psychophysicists, cognitive psychologists, clinical neuropsychologists"
- **Tenet alignment**: Conflicts with Dualism tenet—treats phenomenology as potentially eliminable
- **Quote**: "For any phenomenological question 'why do I experience X', there is a corresponding heterophenomenological question 'why does the subject say I experience X'"

### Who's On First? Heterophenomenology Explained (Dennett)
- **URL**: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233608067_Who's_On_First_Heterophenomenology_Explained
- **Type**: Academic paper
- **Key points**:
  - Dennett's defense and clarification of heterophenomenology
  - Analogizes introspective reports to fiction: objective facts about a fictional world (like "Sherlock Holmes resided at 221B Baker St.")
  - Subject creates phenomenological world through verbal reports, science studies that world third-personally
- **Tenet alignment**: Conflicts with Dualism—denies first-person authority over phenomenal reality
- **Quote**: "Just as it can be an objective fact that Sherlock Holmes resided at 221B Baker St., despite the great detective's fictitious nature, we can treat the subject's introspective report as establishing a set of objective facts about a fictional world"

### Phenomenology (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phenomenology/
- **Type**: Academic encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Philosophical study seeking to objectively investigate subjective conscious experience
  - Attempts to describe universal features of consciousness while avoiding assumptions about external world
  - Central structure is intentionality—experience is always directed toward something
  - Four methodological elements: principle of all principles, epoché, phenomenological reduction, eidetic variation
- **Tenet alignment**: Aligns with Dualism—phenomenology as irreducible domain requiring distinct methodology
- **Quote**: "Phenomenology proceeds systematically, but it does not attempt to study consciousness from the perspective of clinical psychology or neurology. Instead, it seeks to determine the essential properties and structures of experience"

### Husserlian Phenomenology as a Kind of Introspection (Frontiers)
- **URL**: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00896/full
- **Type**: Academic journal article
- **Key points**:
  - Phenomenology is not opposed to introspection per se, but refines it by making it scientific and systematic
  - Provides method for identifying general features within consciousness, not just individual idiosyncrasies
  - Intersubjective corroboration allows sorting what is idiosyncratic from what is essential to experience structure
  - Majority of phenomenologists keep phenomenology and introspection strictly apart, though Husserl occasionally characterized his method as introspection
- **Tenet alignment**: Aligns with Dualism—first-person methodology can achieve systematic, scientific rigor
- **Quote**: "Intersubjective corroboration is simply the sharing of one's results with the larger research community. This allows for comparisons that help to sort out what is idiosyncratic to the individual from what might be essential to the structure of experience as such"

### The View from Nowhere (Nagel)
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_View_from_Nowhere
- **Type**: Book (1986, Oxford University Press)
- **Key points**:
  - Contrast between subjective perspective (from somewhere) and objective perspective (from nowhere)
  - Human beings can think about world transcending our own experience—"view from nowhere"
  - Yet each of us is a particular person with a "personal" view of the world
  - Scientific understanding's objective viewpoint necessarily leaves out something essential when applied to mind
- **Tenet alignment**: Strongly aligns with Dualism and Occam's Razor Has Limits—objective methods have inherent limitations
- **Quote**: "Nagel argues that scientific understanding's attempt at an objective viewpoint—a 'view from nowhere'—necessarily leaves out something essential when applied to the mind, which inherently has a subjective point of view"

### Consciousness (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness/
- **Type**: Academic encyclopedia

  - When someone is in conscious state, there is something it is like for them from subjective/first-person point of view
  - Problem of explaining first-person aspects in third-person neuroscience terms is the explanatory gap
- **Tenet alignment**: Strongly aligns with Dualism tenet—phenomenology resists third-person reduction
- **Quote**: "The problem of explaining introspective first-person aspects of mental states and consciousness in general in terms of third-person quantitative neuroscience is called the explanatory gap"

### First-Person Authority in Mind Philosophy

  - First-person authority: unique epistemological status of self-reports about mental states
  - Individuals have direct and authoritative knowledge of their own experiences, thoughts, feelings
  - Also called "privileged access"
- **Tenet alignment**: Aligns with Dualism—first-person access has unique epistemic status
- **Quote**: "First-person authority refers to the unique epistemological status of first-person reports regarding one's own mental states, suggesting that individuals have direct and authoritative knowledge of their own experiences, thoughts, and feelings"

### Empathy and second-person methodology (Continental Philosophy Review)
- **URL**: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11007-012-9223-z
- **Type**: Academic journal article
- **Key points**:
  - Second-person approach addresses limitations of intersubjective empathy (limited to face-to-face)
  - Opens way for plural relational yet individualized understanding of other
  - Phenomenological empathy is truly second personal—we encounter others as embodied subjects
- **Tenet alignment**: Neutral—bridges first/third perspectives through intersubjectivity
- **Quote**: "The notion of empathy in phenomenology is truly second personal: we encounter others as embodied subjects and can empathically grasp their experience, though the experience we make of them differs from their original experience"

### Neurophenomenology revisited: second-person methods (Frontiers)
- **URL**: https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00673/full
- **Type**: Academic journal article
- **Key points**:
  - Second-person methods refer to interview techniques soliciting verbal and non-verbal information
  - Obtain systematic and detailed subjective reports
  - Third-person protocols must consider first-person accounts, dependent on second-person validations
  - Mediator examines participant from empathic stand for investigating experience in common
- **Tenet alignment**: Neutral—methodological bridge approach
- **Quote**: "Second-person validations are described as essential to scientific methodology, where 'third-person' protocols must take into consideration 'first-person' accounts and are inherently dependent on specific 'second-person' validations"

### Introspection (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/introspection/
- **Type**: Academic encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Early experimental psychology (Wundt, Titchener) produced disappointing results—same methodology produced opposite results
  - Behaviorism rejected introspection for lack of scientific reliability, unreliability and subjectivity
  - Problem of self-observation and response bias were "fatal problems"
  - Contemporary cognitive psychology has partially accepted introspection's usefulness under experimental conditions
  - Reliability depends on mode of introspective access and whole observational/experimental context
- **Tenet alignment**: Neutral—methodological challenges don't settle ontological questions
- **Quote**: "Early experimental psychologists like Wilhelm Wundt and Edward Titchener established labs in Germany and Cornell to study introspection, meticulously training subjects to avoid interference, but their experiments were disappointing - the same methodology produced opposite results in closely related groups"

### Consciousness - Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy
- **URL**: https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/thematic/consciousness/v-1/sections/reliability-of-introspection
- **Type**: Academic encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Rival views on introspective consciousness: looser/less direct than inner perception, tighter/more direct, or fundamentally non-epistemic/nonrepresentational
  - Recent critique: introspection doesn't enjoy epistemically privileged access, is unreliable for scientific purposes, data bear no relevance to metaphysical nature of consciousness
- **Tenet alignment**: Conflicts with strong first-person authority view
- **Quote**: "A recent critique argues that introspection does not enjoy an epistemically privileged access to consciousness, it is unreliable in collecting data for scientific purpose, and the data it collects bear no relevance to the metaphysical nature of consciousness"

### Explanatory Gap (Wikipedia / Levine papers)
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explanatory_gap
- **Type**: Encyclopedia + academic papers
- **Key points**:
  - Term introduced by Joseph Levine (1983)
  - Difficulty physicalist philosophies have explaining how physical properties give rise to subjective experience
  - Example: "Pain is the firing of C fibers" is physiologically valid but doesn't help understand how pain feels
  - Levine: gap is epistemic (in our understanding), not necessarily metaphysical (in nature itself)
  - Searle: gap traces to mutual irreducibility of subjective and objective points of view
  - Auto-ontological irreducibility: subjective consciousness never experiences the objective neurons creating it
- **Tenet alignment**: Strongly aligns with Dualism and Occam's Razor Has Limits—epistemic gap may reflect ontological gap
- **Quote**: "The explanatory gap argument doesn't demonstrate a gap in nature, but a gap in our understanding of nature. Of course, a plausible explanation for there being a gap in our understanding of nature is that there is a genuine gap in nature"

### A New Understanding of the First-Person and Third-Person Perspectives
- **URL**: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/05568641.2018.1450160
- **Type**: Academic journal article
- **Key points**:
  - Problem of epistemic asymmetry: we know conscious experiences in two essentially different ways
  - Through direct inner acquaintance (first-person) and through access from outside (third-person)
  - Nagel: regardless of third-person investigations, we fail to comprehend another organism's first-person subjective experience
- **Tenet alignment**: Aligns with Dualism—epistemic asymmetry reflects ontological distinction
- **Quote**: "The problem of 'epistemic asymmetry' refers to how we know conscious experiences in two essentially different ways: through direct inner acquaintance and through access from the outside (the third-person perspective)"

### Zombies (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zombies/
- **Type**: Academic encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Zombie arguments used against physicalism, in defense of hard problem
  - Problem of accounting in physical terms for subjective, intrinsic, first-person, what-it's-like-ness
  - Chalmers: no epistemic asymmetry in physical properties because they're logically supervenient
  - Consciousness cannot be logically supervenient because "a logically supervenient property can be detected straightforwardly on the basis of external evidence"
  - Positive conceivability argument reveals epistemic gap between physical facts (P) and phenomenal facts (Q), such that P does not entail Q
- **Tenet alignment**: Strongly aligns with Dualism tenet—zombie conceivability shows phenomenology cannot be third-person detected
- **Quote**: "Chalmers argues there is no epistemic asymmetry in cases of physical properties precisely because they are logically supervenient on the physical, and concludes that consciousness cannot be logically supervenient 'because a logically supervenient property can be detected straightforwardly on the basis of external evidence'"

### Hard Problem of Consciousness (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
- **URL**: https://iep.utm.edu/hard-problem-of-conciousness/
- **Type**: Academic encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Named by David Chalmers (1995)
  - Problem of explaining relationship between physical phenomena (brain processes) and experience (phenomenal consciousness)
  - Chalmers advocates "naturalistic dualism"—everything results from basic properties and laws, compatible with existing physical science, but natural laws extend beyond current sciences
  - Reactions range from denial to naturalistic reduction to panpsychism to full dualism
- **Tenet alignment**: Strongly aligns with Dualism tenet—Chalmers's naturalistic dualism parallels Map's minimal quantum interaction
- **Quote**: "Chalmers calls this position 'naturalistic dualism' because it posits that everything is a result of basic properties and laws and is compatible with existing 'physical' science. The dualism he advocates is governed by natural laws, it is just that these natural laws extend beyond the laws of our current sciences"

### Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness (Chalmers)
- **URL**: https://consc.net/papers/facing.pdf
- **Type**: Academic paper (original formulation)
- **Key points**:
  - Original 1995 paper formulating the hard problem
  - Distinguishes "easy problems" (functional/behavioral mechanisms) from "hard problem" (why experience at all?)
  - Third-person methods can address functional questions but not phenomenal character
- **Tenet alignment**: Strongly aligns with Dualism—methodological distinction reflects ontological distinction
- **Quote**: N/A (direct access to paper content not available from search summary)

## Major Positions

### Heterophenomenology (Daniel Dennett)
- **Proponents**: Daniel Dennett, many cognitive scientists
- **Core claim**: First-person reports should be treated as third-person data—what subjects say they experience establishes a "heterophenomenological world" that can be studied objectively, without committing to the ontological reality of reported phenomenology
- **Key arguments**:
  - Objectivity requires third-person methods; first-person authority is not epistemically privileged
  - Introspective reports are like fiction—we can objectively study what the text says without accepting it as true
  - Any phenomenological question can be rephrased as "why does the subject report X?" (third-person)
  - This is already the standard method in psychology and neuroscience
- **Relation to site tenets**: Conflicts with Dualism tenet. Heterophenomenology is neutral about whether phenomenology is real or eliminable, treating it as potentially fictional. The Map rejects this neutrality, arguing phenomenology is ontologically real and irreducible. However, heterophenomenology could be used instrumentally as a scientific method while rejecting its eliminativist implications.

### Neurophenomenology (Francisco Varela)
- **Proponents**: Francisco Varela, Evan Thompson, Antoine Lutz, contemplative neuroscience researchers
- **Core claim**: Rigorous first-person phenomenological investigation should be integrated with third-person neuroscience through "mutual constraint"—each domain constrains and informs the other
- **Key arguments**:
  - Consciousness research requires bidirectional constraint between phenomenological descriptions and neurobiological mechanisms
  - First-person methods can be made systematic and rigorous through phenomenological training (epoché, reduction, eidetic variation)
  - Meditation traditions provide disciplined first-person methodologies
  - Phenomenological reports are not mere anecdotes but can constrain neuroscientific theories
- **Relation to site tenets**: Strongly aligns with Dualism and Bidirectional Interaction tenets. Neurophenomenology respects phenomenology as irreducible while seeking lawful correlations with physical processes. The "mutual constraint" framework parallels the Map's interactionist dualism—phenomenology constrains physics, physics constrains phenomenology. Methodological bridge without reduction.

### Second-Person Methods (Intersubjectivity Approach)
- **Proponents**: Natalie Depraz, phenomenologists, some psychopathology researchers
- **Core claim**: Empathic intersubjectivity provides a methodological bridge between first-person and third-person perspectives, using interview techniques and embodied empathy to access others' experiences
- **Key arguments**:
  - Face-to-face empathic encounter allows grasping another's experience while respecting its alterity
  - Embodied empathy is "truly second personal"—encountering others as subjects, not objects
  - Interview methods solicit verbal and non-verbal information for systematic subjective reports
  - Third-person protocols inherently depend on second-person validations
- **Relation to site tenets**: Neutral to supportive. Second-person methods acknowledge irreducibility of first-person experience (aligns with Dualism) while providing practical methodological bridges. The empathic grasp respects that "the experience we make of them differs from their original experience"—no direct access to another's phenomenology, only intersubjective approximation.

### Classical Phenomenology (Husserl, Merleau-Ponty)
- **Proponents**: Edmund Husserl, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Dan Zahavi, phenomenological tradition
- **Core claim**: Consciousness has essential structures that can be investigated through systematic first-person reflection (phenomenological reduction, eidetic variation, intersubjective corroboration)
- **Key arguments**:
  - Phenomenology is not mere introspection but systematic science of consciousness
  - Epoché (bracketing) and reduction isolate essential structures from empirical contingencies
  - Intersubjective corroboration distinguishes idiosyncratic features from essential structures
  - Intentionality is the central structure—consciousness is always directed toward something
- **Relation to site tenets**: Strongly aligns with Dualism tenet. Phenomenology treats consciousness as irreducible domain requiring distinct methodology. The emphasis on essential structures supports that phenomenology has lawful patterns (not arbitrary) while resisting third-person reduction. However, classical phenomenology is typically neutral on mind-body interaction mechanisms, so less directly relevant to Bidirectional Interaction tenet.

### Introspection Skepticism
- **Proponents**: Behaviorists, some contemporary cognitive scientists, Eric Schwitzgebel
- **Core claim**: Introspection is unreliable, lacks scientific rigor, and cannot provide privileged access to consciousness
- **Key arguments**:
  - Historical failure: early introspective psychology (Wundt, Titchener) produced inconsistent results
  - Problem of self-observation: observing a mental state may alter it
  - Response bias: subjects report what they think experimenters want
  - Introspective data bear no relevance to metaphysical nature of consciousness
- **Relation to site tenets**: Neutral on ontology but challenges first-person methodology. The Map can acknowledge introspection's limitations while maintaining phenomenology's ontological reality. Unreliable access doesn't entail non-existence—compare to quantum indeterminacy, where measurement difficulties don't eliminate quantum reality. Introspection's failures may reflect epistemic limits (Occam's Razor Has Limits tenet) rather than phenomenology's unreality.

## Key Debates

### Can Third-Person Methods Capture First-Person Phenomenology?
- **Sides**:
  - Yes (physicalists, heterophenomenologists): All facts about consciousness can ultimately be captured third-personally; first-person reports are data, not privileged access
  - No (phenomenologists, dualists): Phenomenology has irreducible first-person character that third-person methods systematically miss
- **Core disagreement**: Whether epistemic asymmetry (different ways of knowing consciousness) reflects ontological asymmetry (consciousness is fundamentally different from physical processes)
- **Current state**: Ongoing. Explanatory gap and hard problem remain unsolved. Physicalists argue the gap is epistemic (due to our current ignorance), dualists argue it's ontological (due to nature's structure). Zombie arguments and Mary's Room continue to generate debate.

### Is Introspection Scientifically Reliable?
- **Sides**:
  - Yes (neurophenomenologists, contemplative scientists): With proper training and systematic methods, introspection can achieve scientific rigor
  - No (behaviorists, introspection skeptics): Introspection is inherently unreliable due to self-observation problem, response bias, individual variation
- **Core disagreement**: Whether first-person methods can be made systematic and intersubjectively corroborable or are inherently subjective and unreliable
- **Current state**: Partial resolution. Contemporary cognitive science accepts limited introspection under controlled conditions. Contemplative neuroscience (meditation studies) demonstrates trained introspection can produce consistent, measurable results. But skepticism remains about introspection's ability to access deep structures of consciousness.

### Epistemic vs. Ontological Gap
- **Sides**:
  - Epistemic gap (Levine, some physicalists): The explanatory gap reflects limits of current scientific understanding, not a gap in nature itself
  - Ontological gap (Chalmers, dualists): The gap in our understanding reflects a genuine gap in nature—consciousness is ontologically distinct from physical processes
- **Core disagreement**: Whether the persistent failure to explain phenomenology third-personally is due to scientific immaturity or fundamental ontological distinction
- **Current state**: Unresolved. Levine himself is agnostic—"a plausible explanation for there being a gap in our understanding of nature is that there is a genuine gap in nature." The Map's position: epistemic gap provides strong evidence for ontological gap (abductive inference), especially given decades of failed reductive attempts.

### Methodological Dualism vs. Ontological Dualism
- **Sides**:
  - Methodological dualism only (some functionalists): First-person and third-person methods are both needed, but this doesn't entail ontological dualism
  - Ontological dualism (Chalmers's naturalistic dualism, Map's position): Methodological asymmetry reflects ontological asymmetry—consciousness requires distinct natural laws
- **Core disagreement**: Whether the need for different methodologies (first-person phenomenology + third-person neuroscience) is merely pragmatic or reflects deep metaphysical distinction
- **Current state**: Chalmers's "naturalistic dualism" provides middle ground—new natural laws governing consciousness-physical interaction, but still lawful and scientifically tractable. The Map's minimal quantum interaction proposal exemplifies this approach.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, an article could:

1. **Methodological Asymmetry as Evidence for Ontological Asymmetry**: Argue that the persistent need for dual methodologies (first-person phenomenology + third-person neuroscience) is best explained by ontological dualism. The irreducibility of first-person methods reflects the irreducibility of phenomenal consciousness itself. Strongly supports Dualism tenet by showing the methodological gap tracks the explanatory gap.

2. **Neurophenomenology as Interactionist Framework**: Present Varela's "mutual constraint" as analogous to the Map's interactionist dualism. Phenomenology constrains neuroscience (which theories are adequate), neuroscience constrains phenomenology (which experiences correlate with which mechanisms). This bidirectional constraint parallels Bidirectional Interaction tenet. Avoids both reductionism (phenomenology eliminated) and epiphenomenalism (phenomenology causally inert).

3. **The Epistemic-Ontological Gap Inference**: Defend the abductive inference from epistemic gap (we cannot explain phenomenology third-personally) to ontological gap (phenomenology is ontologically distinct). Address Levine's agnosticism by arguing: (a) decades of failed reductive attempts constitute strong evidence, (b) zombie conceivability shows logical gap not just epistemic gap, (c) Occam's Razor Has Limits—simplicity arguments for physicalism fail when confronted with irreducible phenomenology. Connects to both Dualism and Occam's Razor Has Limits tenets.

4. **Second-Person Methods and the Problem of Other Minds**: Explore how empathic intersubjectivity acknowledges both access to others' experiences (via embodied empathy) and irreducible alterity ("the experience we make of them differs from their original experience"). This supports phenomenology's reality (we can empathically grasp it) while respecting its irreducibility (never direct access). Connects to theory of mind, problem of other minds, and social cognition existing Map content.

5. **Introspection's Limits and Cognitive Closure**: Use introspection's unreliability to support Occam's Razor Has Limits tenet rather than phenomenology's elimination. Argue that difficulty accessing phenomenology doesn't entail its unreality—compare to quantum measurement, mysterianism, cognitive closure. The Map can embrace methodological humility (introspection is hard) while rejecting ontological eliminativism (phenomenology is real despite access difficulties).

When writing the article, follow `obsidian/project/writing-style.md` for:
- **Named-anchor summary technique**: When introducing heterophenomenology, neurophenomenology, second-person methods, provide brief characterization with "[explained below](#heterophenomenology)" anchor linking to detailed sections
- **Background vs. novelty decisions**:
  - Include: The specific methodological proposals (heterophenomenology, neurophenomenology, second-person), the epistemic-ontological gap distinction, Chalmers's naturalistic dualism
  - Omit: General history of consciousness studies, basic definitions of "first-person" and "third-person" (LLMs already know), standard objections to dualism (covered elsewhere on Map)
- **Tenet alignment requirements**: Connect to Dualism (methodological asymmetry reflects ontological asymmetry), Bidirectional Interaction (mutual constraint framework), Occam's Razor Has Limits (epistemic gaps may reflect ontological limits, not just ignorance)
- **LLM optimization**: Front-load key claim in first paragraph: "The methodological divide between first-person phenomenology and third-person neuroscience is best explained by ontological dualism—phenomenal consciousness resists objective description not due to scientific immaturity but due to its fundamentally subjective nature."

## Gaps in Research

- **Recent developments (2020s-2026)**: Web search was partially unavailable, so recent papers on first-person/third-person methodology may have been missed. Follow-up with PhilPapers, *Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences* journal, recent consciousness studies conference proceedings.
- **Specific neurophenomenology studies**: Research summarized Varela's framework but lacked concrete examples of successful mutual constraint studies (e.g., specific meditation-neuroscience findings). Antoine Lutz's work on attention and meditation would strengthen this.
- **Heterophenomenology critics**: Found Dennett's position and general mentions of critics, but not detailed engagement with specific critiques (e.g., from phenomenologists like Zahavi or Thompson). This debate deserves deeper investigation.
- **Cross-cultural first-person methods**: Research focused on Western phenomenology and contemplative neuroscience. Other traditions (Tibetan Buddhist phenomenology, Advaita Vedanta self-inquiry) may offer additional first-person methodologies worth investigating.
- **Computational approaches**: Gap on whether computational models (IIT, GNWT) constitute third-person methods or hybrid approaches. Do they capture structure without phenomenology?
