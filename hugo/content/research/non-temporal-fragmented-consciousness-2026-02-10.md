# Research: Non-Temporal and Fragmented Consciousness

**Date**: 2026-02-10
**Search queries used**: "non-temporal consciousness philosophy Stanford Encyclopedia", "fragmented consciousness philosophy split-brain dissociation", "consciousness without time atemporal experience philosophy", "unity of consciousness fragmentation PhilPapers", "Husserl absolute flow consciousness non-temporal time-constituting", "Tim Bayne unity consciousness fragmentation split-brain", "Dennett consciousness fragmented multiple drafts unity illusion", "atemporal consciousness meditation timelessness neuroscience Frischhut", "quantum consciousness non-temporal Penrose Hameroff orchestrated reduction time", "dissociative identity disorder consciousness unity dualism philosophy mind", "William James stream consciousness unity fragmentation specious present", "Bergson duration consciousness indivisible time", "consciousness personal identity persistence through time narrative self"

## Executive Summary

Non-temporal consciousness and fragmented consciousness are two distinct but related challenges to standard models of mind. Husserl's phenomenology posits an "absolute flow" of consciousness that is itself non-temporal while constituting our experience of time—a paradox that remains central to phenomenological philosophy. Separately, split-brain cases, dissociative identity disorder, and anaesthesia research raise the question of whether consciousness can genuinely fragment into multiple independent streams. For dualist frameworks, both topics carry high stakes: if consciousness can exist outside temporal structure, this supports its irreducibility to physical processes (which are inherently temporal); if consciousness can fragment, this challenges the unity argument traditionally used to support dualism while opening new questions about the nature of the non-physical mind and its relationship to embodiment.

## Key Sources

### Temporal Consciousness (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-temporal/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Surveys three competing models: cinematic (snapshot), retentional (Husserl/Brentano), and extensional (Dainton/Stern)
  - The "specious present" debate: whether consciousness has genuine temporal extension or consists of point-like moments containing representations of time
  - Augustine's paradox: only the present exists, yet we experience duration—motivating all subsequent models
- **Tenet alignment**: Neutral to supportive. The irreducibility of temporal experience to physical description aligns with Dualism tenet
- **Quote**: "The unit of composition of our perception of time is a duration, with a bow and a stern" — William James

### The Unity of Consciousness (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-unity/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - The Unity Thesis: "necessarily, all of the synchronous conscious experiences of a subject at a time are unified with each other"
  - Split-brain cases offer the strongest challenge—four competing models: two-stream, switch, partial unity, unified with access disunity
  - Descartes used unity as an argument for immateriality: if the mind has no parts, it cannot be made of matter
  - DID and schizophrenia raise analogous questions but debate centres on whether these represent genuine phenomenal disunity or disruption of access/integration
- **Tenet alignment**: Strongly relevant to Dualism. The unity argument is historically a key support for substance dualism; fragmentation cases challenge but do not refute it
- **Quote**: "Consciousness at each moment coalesces into a unified whole rather than comprising disconnected fragments"

### Phenomenology and Time-Consciousness (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
- **URL**: https://iep.utm.edu/phe-time/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Husserl's three levels: (1) absolute flow (non-temporal), (2) immanent temporal unities (experiences, acts), (3) transcendent objects in world time
  - The absolute flow is "standing-streaming"—it manifests temporality without itself occurring sequentially
  - Non-temporality of the flow avoids infinite regress: if the time-constituting consciousness existed in succession, another consciousness would be needed for its temporality
  - Husserl: "This flow is something we speak of in accordance with that which is constituted, but it is nevertheless not something that is temporally objective. It is the absolute subjectivity"
- **Tenet alignment**: Strongly aligns with Dualism. A non-temporal foundation of consciousness cannot be reduced to physical processes, which are inherently temporal
- **Quote**: "The constituting and the constituted coincide" — on the self-appearing nature of the absolute flow

### Awareness without Time (Frischhut 2024, The Philosophical Quarterly)
- **URL**: https://academic.oup.com/pq/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/pq/pqae081/7718358
- **Type**: Academic paper
- **Key points**:
  - Advanced meditators report deep states as "timeless" yet continuously alert—an apparent contradiction
  - The Extended Now Interpretation (ENI): "timeless" means experiencing indeterminate duration without temporal structure (no change, order, succession, beginning, or end)
  - Maintaining alertness may itself constitute implicit awareness of duration without awareness of succession
  - Investigates "fringe states of consciousness" as windows into how temporal experience is constructed
- **Tenet alignment**: Supportive of Dualism. If consciousness can shed temporal structure while remaining alert, this suggests temporal experience is constituted by consciousness rather than being an intrinsic feature of the physical substrate
- **Quote**: "Descriptions of deep meditative states as 'timeless' are actually compatible with experiencing indeterminate duration without temporal structure"

### Fragmenting Consciousness (Mashour 2012, PMC)
- **URL**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3523817/
- **Type**: Scientific paper
- **Key points**:
  - Anaesthetics achieve unconsciousness not by suppressing brain activity but by disrupting integration across brain regions
  - Propofol causes temporal fragmentation: neural spiking fragments into on/off states, phase coupling across cortical areas drops
  - Supports the "unbinding" hypothesis: consciousness requires synthesis of activity across specialised brain areas
  - Different cortical regions operating in misaligned temporal cycles prevents coordinated communication
- **Tenet alignment**: Complex. Supports the idea that consciousness correlates with integration (compatible with dualist interaction), but the integration framework is typically physicalist. For the Map: the physical substrate may be a necessary condition for consciousness to interact with the body, without being sufficient for consciousness itself
- **Quote**: "Neuronal spiking became coupled to the phase of the slow oscillation at loss of consciousness, but the phase coupling of these slow oscillations across different areas of the cortex dropped significantly"

### A Layered Unity Model of Split-Brain Consciousness (2025, Philosophical Studies)
- **URL**: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11098-025-02339-3
- **Type**: Academic paper
- **Key points**:
  - Challenges Bayne's unified consciousness model
  - Proposes breakdowns in local experiential layers while preserving unity in global ones
  - Represents the current cutting edge of the split-brain unity debate
- **Tenet alignment**: Neutral. A layered model could be compatible with dualism if the global layer corresponds to non-physical unity

### Husserl, the Absolute Flow, and Temporal Experience (Hoerl 2013)
- **URL**: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1933-1592.2011.00547.x
- **Type**: Academic paper
- **Key points**:
  - Addresses Husserl's own claim that his remarks about the absolute flow are "shocking (when not initially even absurd)"
  - The absolute flow is non-temporal in the sense that temporal categories like succession and simultaneity don't apply to it
  - Yet it has a time-constituting status: it makes possible the disclosure of temporal objects
  - Explores whether representationalism can explain the non-temporal character
- **Tenet alignment**: Aligns with Dualism. A non-temporal constituting consciousness is irreducible to the temporal physical world

### Consciousness Explained (Dennett 1991) — Multiple Drafts Model
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drafts_model
- **Type**: Secondary source on key theory
- **Key points**:
  - Brain runs many parallel information-processing streams with various "drafts" at different stages of editing
  - No single "Cartesian theatre" where consciousness happens; unity is a user-illusion
  - The self is a "centre of narrative gravity"—a virtual construct maintained by constantly revised storylines
  - Dennett claims we feel unified only because the brain continually produces verbal/cognitive narratives that rationalise underlying edits
- **Tenet alignment**: Conflicts with Dualism tenet (denies consciousness as irreducible), conflicts with Bidirectional Interaction (treats consciousness as illusory). However, the Map can engage constructively: if the drafts model describes the physical substrate, dualism adds that something selects among drafts
- **Quote**: "Consciousness is a 'user-illusion'"

## Major Positions

### Non-Temporal Consciousness: The Husserlian Position
- **Proponents**: Husserl, Hoerl, phenomenological tradition
- **Core claim**: The deepest level of consciousness—the "absolute flow"—is itself non-temporal. It constitutes temporal experience through retention, primal impression, and protention, but these structures belong to what consciousness produces, not what consciousness is at its ground level
- **Key arguments**: Avoids infinite regress (if time-constituting consciousness were temporal, something else would need to constitute its temporality); explains how consciousness can grasp past and future without collapsing them into the present
- **Relation to site tenets**: Strongly aligns with Dualism. A non-temporal ground of consciousness is categorically different from the physical world, which is inherently temporal. This provides a powerful argument for irreducibility: no physical process description, which necessarily involves temporal succession, can capture something that exists outside temporal categories

### Atemporal Experience: The Meditative Evidence
- **Proponents**: Frischhut, contemplative traditions (Buddhist, Hindu, Christian mystical)
- **Core claim**: Deep meditative states involve awareness without temporal structure—no succession, change, beginning, or end—yet the meditator remains alert and conscious. This is not unconsciousness but a different mode of conscious experience
- **Key arguments**: Frischhut's ENI resolves the apparent contradiction between "timeless" reports and continued alertness; maintaining alertness constitutes implicit duration-awareness without succession-awareness
- **Relation to site tenets**: Supports Dualism. If consciousness can operate without temporal structure while the brain (a physical system) necessarily operates in time, consciousness and the brain are not identical. Supports Bidirectional Interaction: the meditator's conscious choice to maintain alertness seems to sustain the atemporal state, suggesting downward causation

### Unity of Consciousness: The Bayne Position
- **Proponents**: Tim Bayne, Michael Tye, Descartes (historically)
- **Core claim**: Consciousness is necessarily unified. All synchronous experiences of a subject are phenomenally bound into a single experiential field. Apparent exceptions (split-brain cases) are better explained by the "switch model" where consciousness alternates between hemispheres rather than fragmenting
- **Key arguments**: Introspective evidence; the switch model accounts for split-brain data without positing two conscious streams; historical arguments from indivisibility of mind (Descartes)
- **Relation to site tenets**: Strongly supports Dualism. If consciousness is necessarily unified and indivisible, it cannot be composed of physical parts. This is one of the classical arguments for substance dualism

### Fragmented Consciousness: The Pluralist Position
- **Proponents**: Dennett (illusory unity), some interpreters of split-brain data, proponents of partial unity models
- **Core claim**: Consciousness can be genuinely disunified—either normally (Dennett: unity is always an illusion) or pathologically (split-brain: two streams emerge when neural integration is disrupted)
- **Key arguments**: Split-brain patients show conflicting responses suggesting two simultaneous experiencers; DID patients display distinct personality-bound experiences; anaesthesia fragments neural integration and consciousness ceases; Dennett's multiple drafts model treats unity as a post-hoc narrative
- **Relation to site tenets**: Partially conflicts with Dualism (if consciousness fragments with the brain, this suggests physical dependence). However, a nuanced dualist response exists: the non-physical mind may require an integrated physical substrate as its interface, without being reducible to that substrate. Fragmentation of the interface disrupts interaction, not the mind itself

### Bergson's Duration
- **Proponents**: Henri Bergson
- **Core claim**: Real time (durée) is a continuous, indivisible flow of qualitative experience, fundamentally different from the spatialized, quantified time of physics. Consciousness is inherently durational—it cannot be carved into discrete moments
- **Key arguments**: Scientific time "does not endure"—it is spatialized abstraction. Lived experience is an indivisible qualitative multiplicity. Memory and perception interpenetrate in the continuous flow of duration
- **Relation to site tenets**: Partially aligns with Dualism (consciousness is irreducible to physical/mathematical description) but conflicts with the non-temporal possibility (Bergson insists consciousness is essentially temporal, just not in the physicists' sense). Compatible with Occam's Razor Has Limits (reality is more complex than simple physical models suggest)

### Integration Theory of Consciousness
- **Proponents**: Tononi (IIT), Mashour, neural correlates of consciousness research
- **Core claim**: Consciousness corresponds to integrated information processing. When integration is disrupted (anaesthesia, split-brain), consciousness degrades or fragments. The degree of consciousness tracks the degree of neural integration
- **Key arguments**: Propofol fragments neural phase coupling and consciousness ceases; split-brain patients show reduced cross-hemisphere integration with behavioural dissociation; the unbinding hypothesis explains loss of consciousness without loss of neural activity
- **Relation to site tenets**: Neutral to conflicting. IIT is typically physicalist (consciousness just is integrated information). For the Map: integration may be the physical interface condition that allows consciousness to interact with the brain, without being consciousness itself. Disrupting integration disrupts the interface, not the mind per se

## Key Debates

### Can Consciousness Exist Outside Time?
- **Sides**: Husserl's phenomenological tradition (the absolute flow is non-temporal) vs. Bergson (consciousness is essentially durational) vs. cinematic theorists (consciousness is strictly momentary)
- **Core disagreement**: Whether temporality is constitutive of consciousness or constituted by it. Is time something consciousness does, or something consciousness is?
- **Current state**: Ongoing. Frischhut's 2024 work on meditative timelessness has revitalised the empirical dimension. The phenomenological position has sophisticated theoretical backing but limited empirical testability. Bergson's view has been partially revived by embodied cognition and process philosophy

### Does Split-Brain Produce Two Consciousnesses?
- **Sides**: Two-stream theorists (Sperry, Gazzaniga historically) vs. switch model (Bayne) vs. partial unity (2025 layered model) vs. unified consciousness with access disunity
- **Core disagreement**: Whether the behavioural dissociation in split-brain patients reflects genuine phenomenal fragmentation or merely disrupted access/report mechanisms
- **Current state**: Ongoing, with the 2025 layered unity model representing the latest development. No consensus. The switch model and partial unity model are currently the most discussed alternatives. Modern split-brain research (Pinto et al. 2017) has complicated the picture by showing more unity than expected in everyday conditions

### Is the Unity of Consciousness an Illusion?
- **Sides**: Bayne (unity is real and necessary) vs. Dennett (unity is a user-illusion constructed by narrative) vs. partial unity theorists (unity comes in degrees)
- **Core disagreement**: Whether phenomenal unity is a real feature of consciousness or a post-hoc narrative construction; whether we have epistemic access to our own phenomenal unity
- **Current state**: Ongoing. Bayne's work remains the most comprehensive defence of real unity. Dennett's position is influential but faces the objection that the very act of generating a narrative seems to presuppose a unified experiencer

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, an article could:

1. **"The Non-Temporal Ground of Consciousness"** — Argue that Husserl's absolute flow, combined with meditative evidence, supports dualism by showing consciousness has a non-temporal dimension that physical processes lack. This directly supports the Dualism tenet: if the deepest level of consciousness is non-temporal, it categorically cannot be identical to brain processes, which are inherently temporal. Could integrate Frischhut's ENI as empirical evidence and contrast with Bergson's insistence that consciousness is essentially temporal.

2. **"What Fragmented Consciousness Tells Dualists"** — Engage honestly with the fragmentation challenge. The unity argument is one of dualism's strongest classical supports, but split-brain and DID cases seem to undermine it. A sophisticated response: distinguish between the non-physical mind and its physical interface. Fragmentation of neural integration disrupts the interface, not the mind itself. Analogous to radio signal (non-physical mind) and receiver (brain): breaking the receiver produces garbled output without destroying the signal. This preserves Bidirectional Interaction while accommodating empirical evidence. Must acknowledge this is speculative.

3. **"Consciousness, Time, and Quantum Collapse"** — Connect non-temporal consciousness to the Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet. If consciousness operates at a non-temporal level, this is consistent with its role in quantum collapse, where the measurement problem concerns the transition from superposition to definite outcome—a transition that standard physics cannot fully temporally locate. The non-temporal character of consciousness could explain why it can interface with quantum indeterminacy. Speculative but philosophically coherent.

## Gaps in Research

- **Empirical limitations**: Meditative reports of timelessness are phenomenological; no neuroscientific method yet directly validates atemporal experience versus altered time perception
- **The binding problem for dualism**: If consciousness is non-physical and non-temporal, how does it bind to a specific physical brain at a specific time? The interface model is suggestive but underdeveloped
- **Cross-cultural phenomenology**: Most meditative evidence comes from Buddhist and Hindu traditions; broader cross-cultural investigation of atemporal experience is sparse
- **DID and dualism**: Very little philosophical work specifically addresses what DID implies for dualist theories. Most discussion focuses on physicalist frameworks
- **Animal consciousness and fragmentation**: If split-brain fragmentation occurs in animals (as in Sperry's original cat experiments), what does this imply about non-human consciousness under dualism?
- **Formal models**: No mathematical or computational model of non-temporal consciousness exists; this limits precision and testability
