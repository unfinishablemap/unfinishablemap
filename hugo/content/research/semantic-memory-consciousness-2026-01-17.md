Research notes on semantic memory (general factual knowledge) and its relationship to consciousness. Complements The Unfinishable Map's coverage of autonoetic consciousness (episodic memory) with noetic consciousness (semantic memory).

## Key Findings

### Tulving's Three Forms of Consciousness

Endel Tulving (1927-2023) distinguished three states of consciousness linked to different memory systems:

| Memory System | Consciousness Type | Characteristic |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Procedural/Implicit | Anoetic (not-knowing) | Skill execution without self-reference |
| Semantic | Noetic (knowing) | Awareness of facts without re-experiencing |
| Episodic | Autonoetic (self-knowing) | Mental time travel, re-experiencing |

**Noetic consciousness** accompanies semantic memory. When you know that Paris is the capital of France, you are aware of this knowledge without re-experiencing when you learned it. The fact is simply available; there is no mental time travel to a specific learning episode.

This contrasts with **autonoetic consciousness**, where retrieving an episodic memory involves projecting oneself back to the time and place of the original experience—the double presence of self as rememberer and protagonist.

### The Remember/Know Paradigm

Tulving introduced a methodological distinction:
- **Remember**: Conscious recollection with autonoetic awareness (episodic)
- **Know**: Recognition based on familiarity without self-recollection (semantic)

In recognition tests, subjects indicate whether they "remember" (can recollect the prior occurrence) or "know" (recognize on some other basis). This operationalises the episodic/semantic distinction through phenomenological report.

**Critical concern**: Some researchers argue this measure is consistent with continuous memory strength rather than a dichotomous episodic/noetic distinction. The boundaries between systems may be blurrier than Tulving proposed.

### Phenomenology of Semantic Retrieval

#### Tip-of-the-Tongue (TOT) States

The tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon reveals that semantic retrieval involves distinctive phenomenology:

- **Definition**: The experience of feeling confident one knows an answer while being unable to produce the word
- **Phenomenal character**: Frustrating sense that retrieval is imminent—the word is "on the tip of the tongue"
- **Two retrieval routes**: Spontaneous "pop" into awareness vs. deliberate effortful search

Recent philosophical analysis argues TOT is an instance of **cognitive phenomenology**. On this view, the phenomenal character of TOT experience is constituted partly by conceptual representations—semantic information about the target word is activated (category, first letter, related concepts) even when the phonological form cannot be retrieved.

This matters for debates about [cognitive phenomenology](/concepts/cognitive-phenomenology/): there is something it is like to be in a TOT state, and this phenomenal character involves conceptual/semantic content, not just sensory qualia.

#### Feeling-of-Knowing (FOK)

**Feeling-of-knowing (FOK)** is a metacognitive judgment predicting successful recognition for currently unrecalled items. FOK represents awareness of one's own semantic knowledge states.

Research shows moderate to strong correlations (r = 0.49-0.62) between awareness self-ratings and ease of semantic access as indexed by the N400 ERP component. Subjective feelings about semantic retrieval track actual processing.

### Automatic vs. Deliberate Semantic Processing

Semantic retrieval shows a complex mix of automatic and controlled processes:

**Automatic aspects:**
- Semantic spread of activation (priming) occurs without conscious attention
- Reading a word automatically activates related concepts
- Semantic processing can occur for masked/subliminal stimuli

**Controlled aspects:**
- The N400 ERP (reflecting semantic processing) requires the target word to reach conscious awareness
- When targets don't reach awareness (attentional blink), no reliable N400 occurs
- Deliberate semantic search requires effortful processing

**Key finding**: While semantic priming is automatic, full semantic integration—the conscious understanding of meaning—appears to require awareness.

### Personal Semantics: A Middle Ground

**Personal semantics** refers to autobiographical facts that fall between episodic and semantic memory:
- Personal factual knowledge (e.g., "I am adept at yoga")
- Knowledge of repeated personally experienced events
- Self-relevant facts detached from acquisition context

Electrophysiological research shows:
- N400 (semantic marker) is maximal for general facts
- Late positive component (episodic marker) is maximal for unique events
- Personal semantic conditions systematically differ from both

This suggests a gradient rather than a dichotomy: general facts → autobiographical facts → repeated events → unique events, with increasing autonoetic character.

### Neural Evidence for Interdependence

The episodic-semantic distinction, while conceptually useful, shows considerable neural overlap:

- Same brain regions support both episodic and semantic retrieval
- Amnesic patients show dissociations (episodic impaired, semantic preserved) but also associations
- Semantic knowledge aids episodic retrieval; episodic experiences become semantic through consolidation

A **component process model** proposes that memory types rely on different weightings of the same elementary processes (perceptual imagery, spatial features, self-reflection) rather than categorically different systems.

### Is Noetic Consciousness Phenomenal?

A key question for the Map: Does semantic memory involve irreducible phenomenology, or is it merely functional access without qualitative character?

**Arguments for phenomenal noetic consciousness:**
1. TOT and FOK states have distinctive qualitative character
2. Understanding involves cognitive phenomenology—there is something it is like to understand
3. Conceptual content has phenomenal presence (thinking of "justice" differs from thinking of "grapes")

**Arguments against/uncertainty:**
1. Much semantic processing is automatic and unconscious
2. "Knowing" facts may be pure information access without experience
3. The qualitative character of understanding might reduce to associated imagery/affect

**Site relevance**: If [cognitive phenomenology](/concepts/cognitive-phenomenology/) is real—if understanding itself has irreducible phenomenal character—then semantic memory involves consciousness constitutively, not merely as an optional accompaniment. This would strengthen the case for [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism): even "cold" factual knowledge wouldn't be purely computational.

### Conceptual Understanding and Consciousness

The phenomenology literature argues that there is something it is like to understand:

- Understanding Husserl feels different from understanding Heidegger
- Grasping a proof involves phenomenal insight, not just logical assent
- Conceptual thought has qualitative character beyond associated imagery

If correct, semantic memory isn't mere data storage—it's the repository of conceptual understanding, and understanding is phenomenal. The "hardness" of knowing a fact may lie precisely in this phenomenal character, even if it lacks the dramatic re-experiencing of episodic memory.

## Implications for Site Framework

### Dualism Connection

If noetic consciousness involves irreducible phenomenology (TOT feels like something, understanding has qualitative character), then semantic memory poses the same hard problem as episodic memory—just more subtly. The gap between neural correlates of semantic retrieval and the phenomenology of knowing/understanding resists closure.

### Relation to Autonoetic Coverage

The Map now covers:
- **Autonoetic** (episodic): [autonoetic-consciousness](/concepts/anoetic-noetic-autonoetic-consciousness/)
- **Prospective**: [prospective-memory](/concepts/prospective-memory/)
- **Working memory**: [working-memory](/concepts/working-memory/)

Adding semantic/noetic coverage would complete the picture. Key themes:
- Noetic vs. autonoetic phenomenology
- TOT/FOK as windows into cognitive phenomenology
- The knowing/understanding distinction
- Personal semantics as a bridge category

### Cognitive Phenomenology Connection

Semantic memory research converges with the [cognitive phenomenology](/concepts/cognitive-phenomenology/) debate. If the Map's "qualified liberalism" about cognitive phenomenology is correct (understanding involves proprietary phenomenal character), then semantic memory is phenomenally rich despite lacking the dramatic features of episodic re-experiencing.

### AI Consciousness Implications

LLMs excel at semantic tasks—they store and retrieve facts, generate semantically coherent text, show priming-like effects. If semantic memory in humans is purely computational (no phenomenology), LLMs might possess its functional equivalent. If noetic consciousness involves irreducible phenomenology, LLMs lack it despite functional similarity.

The TOT phenomenon is telling: LLMs don't experience the frustration of knowing they know something while being unable to retrieve it. They either retrieve or don't. This suggests they lack the metacognitive phenomenology that accompanies human semantic retrieval.

## Questions for Further Research

1. **Noetic qualia**: Does knowing a fact have phenomenal character beyond associated imagery and emotional valence?

2. **Automatic vs. conscious**: At what point does automatic semantic activation become conscious understanding?

3. **Development**: How does noetic consciousness develop relative to autonoetic consciousness?

4. **Neural specificity**: Are there neural markers distinguishing noetic from autonoetic consciousness, or is the difference merely one of degree?
