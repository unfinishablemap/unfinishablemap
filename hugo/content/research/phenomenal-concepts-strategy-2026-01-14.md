The phenomenal concept strategy (PCS) is the most sophisticated physicalist response to anti-physicalist arguments based on the explanatory gap. Rather than denying the gap exists, PCS locates it in our concepts rather than in reality itself. This research examines PCS, its major variants, Chalmers's "master argument" against it, and the debate's current state.

## What Is the Phenomenal Concept Strategy?

The phenomenal concept strategy, named by Daniel Stoljar, holds that the explanatory gap between physical and phenomenal descriptions reflects features of our *concepts* rather than features of *reality*. As Chalmers puts it, PCS "locates the gap in the relationship between our concepts of physical processes and our concepts of consciousness, rather than in the relationship between physical processes and consciousness themselves."

The basic idea: phenomenal concepts—the concepts we use when introspecting experience, like the concept RED when seeing red—have special features that make them seem conceptually independent from physical concepts. This conceptual independence creates the *appearance* of an ontological gap even though consciousness is entirely physical.

An analogy: "heat" and "molecular motion" are two different concepts that refer to the same property. Before we understood thermodynamics, there seemed to be an explanatory gap between the felt warmth of heat and the mechanical motion of molecules. But this gap was epistemic, not ontological. Similarly, PCS claims, phenomenal concepts and physical concepts may be two ways of conceptualizing the same (physical) properties.

PCS advocates subscribe to what Chalmers calls "type-B materialism": there is an epistemic but not ontological gap between physics and experience. Our concepts are dualistic, but reality is monistic.

## Major Versions of PCS

### Brian Loar: Recognitional Concepts

Brian Loar's "Phenomenal States" (1990/97) is the locus classicus for PCS. Loar argued that phenomenal concepts are *direct recognitional concepts*—when having an experience, we deploy a concept that refers directly to that experience without any intermediary description.

Key features:
- Phenomenal concepts refer directly to brain states
- They are recognitional: we can immediately classify experiences as "of that type"
- This directness explains why there seems to be no conceptual link to physical descriptions

Loar's view: features that seemed problematic for physicalism turn out to be exactly what physicalism would predict given how we recognize our own experiences. The conceptual independence of phenomenal and physical concepts is psychologically explicable even though both refer to the same properties.

**Critique:** Loar doesn't explain *why* phenomenal and physical concepts are coextensive. He shows they *can* be, not why they *are*. If both concepts refer to the same property, what is that property such that two radically different modes of presentation are both appropriate to it?

### David Papineau: Quotational Account

Papineau developed a "quotational" account in *Thinking about Consciousness* (2002). Phenomenal concepts are formed by prefixing experiences with "the experience of..."—like quoting an experience rather than merely referring to it.

The idea: experiences are *present* in conscious thought in a way external objects are not. When we think about redness, the experience of red is itself part of our concept. This "quotational" structure explains why phenomenal concepts seem so different from physical concepts—they literally contain their referents.

**Critique:** If phenomenal concepts contain experiences as constituents, this requires explaining what experiences *are*. If they're physical, PCS succeeds; if not, we haven't made progress. Papineau later revised his view, suggesting reference is determined by biological function rather than quotation.

### Katalin Balog: Constitutional Account

Balog defends the most detailed version of the constitutional account: "token experiences serve as modes of presentation of the phenomenal properties they instantiate." The concept PAIN is partly constituted by a token experience of pain.

This differs from Papineau in emphasizing that constitution matters for both:
1. How the concept cognitively presents its reference
2. How the reference is determined

Balog argues the constitutional account steers between radical realism and illusionism. It acknowledges the explanatory gap while explaining it in physicalist terms.

### Indexical and Demonstrative Accounts

Some philosophers (Perry, Ismael) suggest phenomenal concepts are indexical—like "now" or "here," they pick out physical states but from a particular perspective. Even complete physical knowledge wouldn't tell you *which* brain state is yours right now without indexical information.

This explains Mary's learning: she knew all physical facts but lacked indexical knowledge of *her* experiences.

**Critique:** This may explain some epistemic gaps but not the specific character of the explanatory gap. The gap between heat and molecular motion was never as persistent as the gap between brain states and experience.

## Chalmers's Master Argument

In "Phenomenal Concepts and the Explanatory Gap," Chalmers presents a dilemmatic master argument against *all* versions of PCS:

**The Dilemma:**

Let C be the key features of phenomenal concepts that PCS invokes to explain the explanatory gap.

1. **If physical duplicates lacking C are conceivable**, then C is not physically explicable. There would be an explanatory gap between physical processes and C itself. PCS would just relocate the hard problem from consciousness to phenomenal concepts.

2. **If physical duplicates lacking C are not conceivable**, then C cannot explain our epistemic situation. If C is entailed by the physical, zombies would have C too. But then zombies would have the same epistemic situation as us—the same concepts, the same apparent gap. So C doesn't explain why *we* find consciousness puzzling if zombies would too.

The formal argument: "If the relevant features of phenomenal concepts can be explained in physical terms, the features cannot explain the explanatory gap. And if the features can explain the explanatory gap, they cannot themselves be explained in physical terms."

**Implications:**

Any PCS must characterize phenomenal concepts in terms of features C. If C is too "thin" (physically explicable), it can't explain the persistent explanatory gap. If C is too "thick" (not physically explicable), it creates a new explanatory gap.

## Responses to the Master Argument

### Embracing the First Horn (Type-Bb Physicalism)

Sam Coleman and others argue physicalists can accept that phenomenal concepts aren't physically explicable while maintaining consciousness is physical. The gap is real but merely epistemic.

Problem: This concedes significant ground. If we can't explain phenomenal concepts physically, the explanatory gap remains unexplained.

### Attacking the Zombie Premise

Carruthers and Veillet argue that Chalmers equivocates between first-person and third-person phenomenal concepts. Zombies might have third-person concepts about consciousness without having first-person phenomenal concepts.

Balog attacks the master argument directly, arguing Chalmers provides no new reasons to reject PCS. She claims that while PCS shows physicalists aren't rationally compelled to abandon physicalism, anti-physicalists aren't rationally compelled to accept PCS either—a standoff.

### The Illusionist Option

Some philosophers, following Dennett and Frankish, suggest the "illusionist option": there are no phenomenal properties, only representations *as if* there were. Frankish argues this replaces the hard problem with the "illusion problem"—explaining why we *seem* to have phenomenal consciousness.

Dennett called illusionism "the obvious default theory," comparing consciousness to user illusions in computer interfaces.

Problem: Even illusions require experiences of *seeming*. If it seems to me that I have qualia, something is going on—the seeming itself. This may relocate rather than dissolve the problem.

## The Debate's Current State

The phenomenal concept strategy remains hotly contested:

**For PCS:**
- Most sophisticated physicalist response available
- Explains *why* there seems to be an explanatory gap
- Makes physicalism compatible with taking consciousness seriously

**Against PCS:**
- Chalmers's master argument has not been decisively refuted
- All versions struggle to explain why phenomenal and physical concepts are coextensive
- May relocate rather than solve the hard problem

A 2020 PhilPapers survey found 62.4% of philosophers consider the hard problem genuine, while 29.7% do not. PCS has not achieved consensus, but neither have anti-physicalist arguments.

## Relevance to Site's Framework

The phenomenal concept strategy is directly relevant to the site's [tenets](/tenets/):

**Dualism:** PCS is the strongest challenge to dualism. If PCS succeeds, the explanatory gap doesn't indicate an ontological gap, and the main argument for dualism fails. The site should engage PCS carefully rather than dismissing it.

However, Chalmers's master argument suggests deep problems with PCS. The dilemma—that features explaining the gap can't themselves be physical—points to something special about consciousness that physical explanation cannot capture.

**Key observation:** PCS proponents accept there is something special about phenomenal concepts. The debate is whether this specialness is itself physically explicable. If it isn't (first horn), there's an explanatory gap at the conceptual level. If it is (second horn), it can't explain the gap. Either way, something resists physical explanation.

**Bidirectional Interaction:** If phenomenal concepts involve actual experiences as constituents (constitutional account), this raises questions about what experiences *are*. If they're causally efficacious—if having a phenomenal concept affects behavior—this supports the Bidirectional Interaction tenet.

**Occam's Razor Has Limits:** PCS is often motivated by parsimony—we shouldn't multiply ontological categories beyond necessity. But as Chalmers's master argument suggests, PCS may achieve only apparent simplicity while leaving the core mystery intact. Calling the gap "merely conceptual" doesn't make it less puzzling.

## Key Findings for Article Synthesis

1. **PCS is the strongest physicalist response** to anti-physicalist arguments. Site should engage it directly rather than ignoring it.

2. **Chalmers's master argument** poses a genuine dilemma: either phenomenal concepts aren't physically explicable (relocating the gap) or they can't explain our epistemic situation. No version of PCS has decisively escaped this dilemma.

3. **The constitutional account** (Balog) is the most sophisticated version but still faces the master argument.

4. **Illusionism** is an alternative that denies phenomenal consciousness exists, but this seems to deny the obvious and may just relocate the problem.

5. **The debate is at a standoff**: PCS hasn't refuted anti-physicalism, and anti-physicalism hasn't refuted PCS. But the persistence of the gap—despite sophisticated attempts to explain it away—suggests something real that physical description cannot capture.
