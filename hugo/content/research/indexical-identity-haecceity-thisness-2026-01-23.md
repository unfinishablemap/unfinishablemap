## Executive Summary

The indexical identity problem asks: "Why am I *this* person rather than someone else?" This becomes philosophically crucial in contexts like the many-worlds interpretation (MWI), where all measurement outcomes occur but subjective experience tracks only one branch. The problem connects to medieval debates about haecceity (thisness), Robert Adams's theory of primitive thisness (1979), and contemporary haecceitism debates. For MWI, critics argue self-location uncertainty fails because either (1) the uncertainty is spurious (all successors are equally "you"), or (2) it presupposes the Born rule. This directly supports the No Many Worlds tenet: indexical facts about conscious experience resist explanation in frameworks treating all branches as equally real.

## Major Positions (Summary)

**Haecceitism** (Scotus, Adams, Plantinga): Individuals have irreducible thisness grounding numerical identity. Supports No Many Worlds—if branches are qualitatively identical, primitive thisness must track subjective continuity.

**Anti-Haecceitism** (Lewis): All identity facts supervene on qualitative facts. Conflicts with the phenomenology of indexical consciousness.

**Self-Location Uncertainty** (Wallace, Saunders, Vaidman): Everettian probability derives from uncertainty about branch location. Critics (Friederich, Dawid) show this fails—either no genuine uncertainty exists, or Born rule is presupposed.

**Vertiginous Question** (Hellie, List): The fact that *this* experience is mine is an irreducible ontological primitive. Challenges both physicalism and naïve dualism.

## Key Debates (Summary)

**Haecceitism vs Anti-Haecceitism**: Can worlds differ solely by individual permutation? Ongoing. Quantum mechanics (identical fermions are numerically distinct) vindicates haecceitism empirically.

**MWI Self-Location**: Friederich & Dawid's critique is decisive against attempts to ground probability in indexical uncertainty.

**The Vertiginous Question**: Emerging area. List (2025) argues first-person indexical facts are evidence against third-personal metaphysics.

## Research Gaps

- **John Perry's indexical theory**: "The Problem of the Essential Indexical" (1979) not covered
- **Chalmers on indexicality**: Connection to two-dimensional semantics unclear
- **QBism and indexicality**: How agent-relative quantum states relate to indexical identity
- **Buddhist no-self (Anatta)**: Cross-cultural perspective on anti-haecceitism
- **Parfit's fission cases**: Need deeper analysis of *Reasons and Persons* Part III

## Relation to Site Tenets

**No Many Worlds (Strong Support)**: The "why-this-branch" question poses an unanswerable problem for MWI. If all branches are ontologically symmetric, what grounds the fact that *my* consciousness tracks this outcome? Self-location uncertainty fails; primitive thisness is required but undermines MWI's core claim.

**Dualism (Refinement)**: Consciousness involves both qualitative character (qualia) and indexical thisness (mineness). The non-physical aspect includes not just *what* is experienced but *that it is experienced by this subject*.

**Minimal Quantum Interaction (Indirect Support)**: Quantum mechanics violates Leibniz's Identity of Indiscernibles. If quantum systems have primitive thisness, consciousness may modulate pre-existing identity structures rather than creating them.

**Occam's Razor Has Limits**: Anti-haecceitism appeals to parsimony, but the vertiginous question shows qualitative facts don't capture everything real about consciousness.
