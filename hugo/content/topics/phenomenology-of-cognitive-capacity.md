Consciousness has a felt size. When you try to hold one too many things in mind, there is a quality of *saturation* — something thickens, items slip, and you feel yourself running out of room. Conversely, when a practised skill passes into automaticity, consciousness *withdraws*, freeing capacity for deployment elsewhere. The Unfinishable Map argues that both experiences — approaching the ceiling from below and clearing space through delegation — reveal consciousness as an active, bandwidth-limited agent rather than a passive observer. The phenomenology of cognitive capacity provides evidence that consciousness encounters its own operational boundaries from inside, and that these boundaries are irreducible to functional descriptions of [working-memory](/concepts/working-memory/) limits or skill consolidation.

## The Texture of Saturation

Cognitive load builds gradually, and the building has phenomenal character at each stage.

**Early load** feels like competence. Holding two or three items while reasoning about their relationships is experienced as comfortable engagement — a sense of grip where the act of maintenance is nearly transparent.

**Intermediate load** introduces vigilance. As you add elements, you become aware of the act of holding. What was transparent becomes effortful. Items don't simply stay present but must be actively refreshed. The phenomenology shifts from grasping to juggling.

**Near-capacity load** produces a felt density or thickness of consciousness. Everything competes for the same space. Adding one more element doesn't just add to the collection — it destabilises what's already there. You feel the precariousness: any small disruption could collapse the whole structure.

This progression is *graded*. There is no sharp boundary between managing and failing but a continuous deterioration in the felt quality of holding. You *feel* yourself approaching the limit before you actually lose items.

### The Moment of Overflow

When load exceeds capacity, items don't gently fade — they *drop*. The experience is of sudden loss: a premise you were holding simply vanishes, and you feel the gap. There is a distinctive quality of *absence* where presence had been.

This dropping has several phenomenal features. It feels *involuntary* — the loss happens despite your effort to maintain. It is *specific* — you often know what shape the gap has, even when you can no longer access the content. And it *cascades* — losing one element destabilises others maintained in relation to it. These features are difficult to explain if cognitive load is merely information processing: a computational system that drops data simply lacks it, but a conscious subject experiences the form of what was lost.

Sustained overload produces something different from acute item loss: a *fog* — a general degradation of mental clarity affecting the entire quality of consciousness. Even simple tasks feel laborious. Reading becomes something you push through. The fog suggests that working memory and consciousness share resources at a fundamental level, or that consciousness *is* the resource working memory draws upon.

## The Texture of Withdrawal

Automatisation — the process by which conscious, effortful cognition becomes unconscious and effortless — is the mirror image of overload. Where overload is consciousness encountering a ceiling, automatisation is consciousness vacating a domain.

The transition is not a clean switch. A new driver consciously monitors mirror checks, gear changes, and following distances. Over months, these become automatic. But in the middle phase, consciousness *hovers* — the driver no longer actively thinks about checking mirrors but remains dimly aware of doing so. This hovering awareness could sharpen into full attention if something unexpected appeared.

The gradient has directional momentum. Once a skill begins to automate, the default trajectory is toward less conscious involvement. Maintaining access to an automating process requires [mental-effort](/concepts/mental-effort/) — the same effort required to sustain attention on a boring stimulus. Consciousness must actively resist its own withdrawal.

### What Remains After Withdrawal

When consciousness withdraws from an automatised process, something remains. A fluent reader no longer consciously decodes letter shapes, yet reading is not phenomenologically blank. There is still *something it is like* to read — a felt sense of meaning arriving. Tulving (1985) called this *anoetic consciousness*: a form of awareness that registers environmental contingencies without explicit self-awareness. The Map treats anoetic consciousness as a genuine, if minimal, mode of phenomenal experience.

This residual phenomenology matters. If automatised processes were genuinely unconscious — if there were nothing it is like to perform them — then automatisation would be the literal disappearance of experience from a domain. Instead, it is a *transformation*: from focal, deliberate, and articulable to peripheral, effortless, and resistant to verbal report. Automatised skills retain [phenomenal character](/concepts/phenomenal-consciousness/) while losing reflective access.

### The Transition as Liberation

Retrospective reports suggest that automatisation is not experienced as loss. Drivers do not mourn conscious mirror-checking. The withdrawal feels like *relief*. The Map's framework interprets this through the [interface model](/concepts/attention-as-interface/): automatisation represents *reallocation* of a scarce resource, not merely cost reduction. Consciousness is not retreating — it is being released for other work.

## What Capacity Reveals About Consciousness

### The Felt Size of Consciousness

The most striking feature of this phenomenology is that consciousness has a determinate (if fuzzy) boundary to how much it can hold at once, and you experience this boundary from inside. Miller's "seven plus or minus two" — revised downward by Cowan (2001) to roughly four items without rehearsal — describes an information-processing limit. But the phenomenology adds something the information-processing account misses: the *experience* of limitation. You don't infer overload from noticing errors; you experience the strain before errors occur.

If this phenomenology is accurate, consciousness has privileged access to its own operational limits — a form of self-knowledge that functional description alone cannot capture.

### The Maintenance Problem

Cognitive load reveals that maintaining representations in working memory is *active*. Items don't persist on their own; they must be held there. This holding is effortful, with qualitative character distinct from the effort of reasoning. Before you can reason about premises, you must keep them present in consciousness. The [phenomenology-of-intellectual-effort](/topics/phenomenology-of-intellectual-effort/) explores the strain of reasoning itself; capacity phenomenology reveals the more basic work of simply keeping materials available.

If consciousness were epiphenomenal, there would be no phenomenology of effort in maintenance. Items would simply be stored or not, and consciousness would observe the results. Instead, the experience is of *doing* — actively holding, refreshing, sustaining. Behavioural evidence supports this: participants reliably predict when they are approaching capacity before performance degrades (Rouder et al., 2008).

### Evidence for the Interface Model

The phenomenology of cognitive capacity — both its limits and how automatisation manages them — aligns with what a bandwidth-limited selection mechanism would predict.

**Capacity constraints.** Learning one new skill while maintaining automatic competencies is possible, but learning multiple new skills simultaneously is extremely difficult. Consciousness can supervise one domain of novel activity while delegating others to automated routines but cannot supervise everything at once.

**Graceful degradation.** When load increases, the most recently automatised skills are first to require conscious re-engagement. A stressed driver of two years might need to think about lane changes again; a thirty-year veteran does not. This ordering suggests a hierarchy of automation depth.

**The impossibility of total automation.** No matter how skilled someone becomes, some core of their activity remains under conscious oversight. Expert musicians automate finger placement but maintain conscious control of interpretive expression. The tasks that resist automation share a feature: they involve genuine novelty, ambiguity, or evaluative judgement. If consciousness were merely a training signal that could be fully replaced, total automation should be achievable. The persistent residue of conscious involvement suggests consciousness plays an ongoing role that procedural memory cannot replicate.

## The Reversal Problem

Automatisation is not strictly one-directional. Skills can de-automatise through disuse, injury, or the [choking phenomenon](/topics/choking-phenomenon-mental-causation/). The phenomenology of de-automatisation is revealing.

When a previously automatic skill re-enters consciousness, the experience is distinctly unpleasant. The skill feels clumsy, fragmented, and effortful beyond simple ability degradation. There is a phenomenological *mismatch*: consciousness is re-engaging with neural systems that have been restructured for automatic operation.

This mismatch suggests that automatisation involves genuine structural changes in cognitive architecture, not merely the withdrawal of attention. The systems that consciousness built during learning have been reorganised for efficient automatic operation. When consciousness attempts to re-enter, it encounters a system that no longer has the interfaces it originally used. The [phenomenology of returning attention](/topics/phenomenology-of-returning-attention/) to familiar domains reflects this architectural incompatibility.

The Map interprets this as evidence for bidirectional interaction. Consciousness actively constructs the procedural systems that will replace it, then departs. The resulting systems bear the imprint of conscious selection even after consciousness withdraws. The clumsiness of de-automatisation is the felt consequence of trying to operate through interfaces that conscious construction has since obsoleted.

## Embodiment

The phenomenology of cognitive capacity is not purely mental. Heavy cognitive load produces bodily sensations: tension in the forehead, tightening around the eyes, a felt pressure with spatial quality. These are not mere accompaniments — they are part of how capacity limits are experienced. This [embodied](/concepts/embodied-cognition/) dimension suggests that consciousness draws on resources with both mental and physical expression, experienced as a unified phenomenon rather than separate channels.

## What Would Challenge This View

The claim that cognitive capacity phenomenology is irreducible would face difficulty if:

**Felt capacity failed to track actual capacity.** If subjective overload were a poor predictor of performance errors — if people regularly felt overloaded while performing well — the claim that phenomenology provides privileged access to cognitive limits would weaken. Current evidence supports the correlation, but more rigorous testing would be valuable.

**Training eliminated the phenomenology without reducing the limitation.** If expert meditators could maintain the same capacity limits while losing the phenomenal character of load — performing identically but without experiencing overload — this would suggest the phenomenology is decoration rather than information.

**Total automation proved achievable.** If a skill could be practised to the point where no conscious oversight remained — not even the residual anoetic awareness the Map describes — the case for consciousness as an ongoing causal contributor would weaken.

## Relation to Site Perspective

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: The felt quality of approaching capacity — the thickening, the precariousness, the shaped absence when items drop — is not captured by any functional description of working memory limits. A computational system that exceeds buffer capacity simply fails. A conscious subject *experiences* the approaching limit. Similarly, automatisation is not merely "fading" as a neural process winds down — consciousness *withdraws* from a domain of interaction, leaving behind physical systems it helped structure. The gradient of withdrawal and the architectural mismatch of de-automatisation point to consciousness as something that engages with and disengages from physical systems, rather than being identical to them.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)**: The maintenance work revealed by cognitive load supports mental causation. Holding items in working memory feels effortful because consciousness is doing real work — sustaining representations against decay. The correlation between felt effort and maintenance success suggests the effort is causally efficacious. And automatisation provides further evidence: consciously directed practice produces different neural outcomes than passive repetition (Ericsson et al., 1993). The systems consciousness builds are qualitatively distinct from those built without it.

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)**: If consciousness biases quantum indeterminacy through a mechanism requiring sustained attentional focus, the pressure toward automatisation makes functional sense: any competence that can be delegated to deterministic procedural systems *should* be, freeing the scarce quantum-selection capacity for domains where genuine indeterminacy remains — novel situations, creative decisions, moments requiring genuine choice.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)**: The phenomenology of cognitive overflow presupposes genuine loss. When an item drops from working memory, you experience it as *gone*. The felt involuntariness of overflow, the shaped absence, the cascading disruption — all presuppose a single stream of consciousness in which maintenance either succeeds or fails.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)**: Reducing cognitive load to buffer overflow and automatisation to skill consolidation misses the phenomenology. The experience of approaching cognitive limits is rich, graded, embodied, and informative. The experience of automatisation records the dynamics of a causal agent interacting with the matter it shapes. These reductions discard what is most distinctive about the phenomena.
