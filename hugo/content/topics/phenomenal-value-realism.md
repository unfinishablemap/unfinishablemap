Where does value come from? Not instrumental value—the usefulness of a hammer or the market price of a house—but *intrinsic* value, the kind that makes something worth caring about for its own sake. The Unfinishable Map holds that intrinsic value is a feature of conscious experience itself. The felt badness of suffering *is* badness. The felt goodness of joy *is* goodness. This position—[phenomenal-value-realism](/topics/phenomenal-value-realism/)—is where the Map's metaphysics meets the questions that matter most.

## The Claim in Plain Terms

Phenomenal value realism says that certain qualities of experience are simultaneously descriptive and normative. Pain describes how an experience feels *and* constitutes something bad. These are not two properties that happen to coincide—they are one property under two descriptions.

Sharon Hewitt Rawlette, in *The Feeling of Value* (2016), puts it directly: "When we feel pleasure, we are feeling intrinsic goodness itself." This identity claim is stronger than typical defences of hedonism. Hedonists often argue pleasure causes or indicates value. Rawlette argues pleasure *is* value.

Three tests support the identity:

**The coherence test.** "This is intensely pleasant, but there is nothing good about it." The sentence is not merely false—it is incoherent, like "this triangle has four sides." Someone who sincerely asserts it means something different by "pleasant" than everyone else does.

**The transparency test.** When experiencing pleasure, you do not infer its goodness from a theory. The goodness is transparent in the experience—attending to the pleasure just *is* attending to something good. There is no residual question "granted this is pleasant, but *why* is it good?" The question dissolves because goodness is what you are already attending to. (A sceptic might object that introspection is unreliable—people misidentify the sources of their emotions, confabulate reasons for choices. But phenomenal value realism does not depend on introspection about *causes*. It depends on the character of experience *as experienced*. You can be wrong about why you feel pain; you cannot be mistaken that the pain feels bad.)

**The explanatory economy test.** If pleasure and goodness were distinct properties, their perfect correlation would demand explanation. What mechanism ensures every pleasure is good? The identity thesis eliminates this burden: they correlate because they are the same thing. (Note: this is not an appeal to Occam's Razor as a general principle—the Map's [fifth tenet](/tenets/#occams-limits) holds that parsimony is unreliable when knowledge is incomplete. The point is narrower: the two-property hypothesis creates a specific explanatory debt that the identity hypothesis does not.)

### Pain Dissociation: A Challenge

Pain asymbolia patients feel pain sensations without finding them distressing. Does this refute the identity of pain and badness? It complicates the naive version. What it reveals is that "pain" as used in ordinary language conflates two dissociable components: a sensory quality (nociception reaching consciousness) and an affective quality (the felt badness). Phenomenal value realism's identity claim applies to the affective component—the felt *unpleasantness*—not to the bare sensory signal. Pain asymbolia patients lack the affective component; they detect tissue damage without experiencing it as bad. This is consistent with the identity thesis: where the felt badness is absent, so is the disvalue.

## The Metaethical Landscape

Phenomenal value realism sits uneasily in standard metaethical categories. Understanding where it fits—and where it breaks the categories—illuminates what the position actually claims.

### The Queerness Objection Transformed

G.E. Moore's non-naturalism holds that goodness is a simple, indefinable property—we recognise it directly, but cannot analyse it in natural terms. J.L. Mackie's "argument from queerness" targeted this: if goodness were a non-natural property, we would need a special faculty to perceive it, and there would be strange metaphysical entities (objective values) floating free in reality.

Phenomenal value realism transforms the queerness objection. Value is not a mysterious property floating in Platonic space—it is a feature of conscious experience, which we access directly through having experiences. The "special faculty" for perceiving value is just consciousness itself. The intrinsic badness of pain is not detected by some sixth moral sense; it is constitutive of what pain feels like.

This does not entirely dissolve queerness worries. If consciousness is irreducible (as the Map's [dualism](/tenets/#dualism) holds), then phenomenal properties are themselves "queer" from a physicalist perspective. But this shifts the queerness: it is the queerness of consciousness, not the additional queerness of moral properties. If you have already accepted irreducible phenomenal properties, adding that some of them are value-properties requires no further ontological cost.

### The Is-Ought Gap

Hume's is-ought gap—the claim that normative conclusions cannot be derived from purely descriptive premises—has shaped metaethics since the eighteenth century. Phenomenal value realism claims to dissolve this gap: some experiential properties are simultaneously descriptive (how experiences feel) and normative (what intrinsic goodness is).

The response distinguishes two readings. On one reading, the is-ought gap concerns logical derivation: you cannot derive an "ought" statement from purely "is" statements without smuggling in normative premises. Phenomenal value realism does not violate this—it does not derive "suffering is bad" from non-normative premises; it identifies the normative fact with the phenomenal fact. On the stronger reading, the gap concerns ontology: there cannot be properties that are both descriptive and normative. Phenomenal value realism rejects this stronger claim. The experiential quality of suffering just is intrinsically bad; this is not a derivation but an identity.

### Naturalism's Open Question

Analytic naturalists identify moral properties with natural properties—"good" means something like "pleasure" or "desire-satisfaction." Moore's Open Question Argument challenges this: for any natural property N, we can coherently ask "X is N, but is it good?" This suggests goodness and N are conceptually distinct.

Rawlette's response: the question only seems open when we consider pleasure abstractly. When actually experiencing intense pleasure and asking "is *this* good?"—attending directly to its phenomenal character—the question closes. The goodness is manifest in the experience, not inferred from description. The apparent openness at the conceptual level does not survive phenomenological engagement.

The Map extends this response beyond hedonism. The same closing-under-attention applies to other phenomenal features: genuine understanding feels intrinsically valuable when you are experiencing it, not merely when you describe it. Authentic connection carries its significance in the experience itself.

## What the Alternatives Miss

### Preference Satisfaction

The dominant approach in economics and much of AI alignment grounds value in preference satisfaction: what is good for you is getting what you want. The Map rejects this. Evolution shaped preferences for reproductive fitness, not flourishing. You can prefer things that make your experience worse—addictive substances, status games that produce anxiety, comfort zones that prevent growth.

More fundamentally, preferences are *about* experiential states they do not capture. You prefer to avoid pain because pain feels bad. The preference tracks the value; it does not constitute it. A system that satisfies preferences without generating any conscious experience has achieved nothing of value—it has optimised a function that was only ever a proxy for what matters.

This matters urgently for [AI alignment](/topics/purpose-and-alignment/). If we align AI systems to maximise preference satisfaction, we target a proxy that can come apart from the thing it tracks. [Experiential alignment](/concepts/experiential-alignment/)—targeting the felt quality of conscious life—aims at the real thing.

### Error Theory

Error theorists—most influentially J. L. Mackie in *Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong* (1977)—hold that all moral claims are false because nothing has objective value. The universe is just matter in motion; "good" and "bad" are projections we impose.

Phenomenal value realism's response is direct: attend to actual suffering. Not the concept of suffering, not a description of neural activation patterns—the experience itself. The claim "this suffering contains nothing bad" is not a bold philosophical thesis. It is a failure to understand what the word "bad" refers to.

Error theory gains its plausibility from considering value abstractly, at a distance. It loses plausibility the moment one considers actual experience.

### Constructivism

Constructivists hold that value is built through rational procedures—whether Rawls's contractualism or Korsgaard's Kantian appeal to practical identity and rational agency. Moral facts are products of reasoning, not features of experience waiting to be discovered.

The Map's objection: consciousness was valuable before any reasoning being existed to construct value systems. The suffering of the first creature capable of feeling pain was bad—not because a social practice labelled it so, but because of what pain feels like from the inside. Value was there before anyone constructed it.

Constructivism also cannot explain the authority of moral claims. If value is constructed, why should the construction bind us? The constructivist answer—because rational agents would endorse it—assumes rationality is authoritative, which requires further construction. The regress terminates only when we reach something that matters intrinsically: the felt quality of experience.

## Beyond Hedonism

Rawlette defends a hedonistic version: pleasure and pain exhaust intrinsic value. The Map extends this to **phenomenal value pluralism**. Multiple features of experience have intrinsic value—not just hedonic valence:

| Feature | Phenomenal Character | Value Dimension |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Hedonic valence | Felt pleasure/pain quality | Well-being core |
| Aesthetic quality | Beauty/ugliness in experience | Aesthetic value |
| Meaning | Felt significance of engagement | Eudaimonic value |
| Agency | Felt authorship of choices | Autonomy value |
| Understanding | Phenomenal "click" of grasping | Epistemic value |
| Connection | Felt quality of authentic relating | Relational value |

Each row identifies a phenomenal feature—something that shows up in the character of experience—and claims it contributes to intrinsic value. This is not an objective list theory (where items are valuable independent of experience); all value resides in how things are experienced.

### Why Extend Beyond Hedonism?

Three considerations motivate the extension:

**The meaning problem.** Some experiences are deeply meaningful without being particularly pleasant. Completing a difficult creative project can involve frustration and exhaustion, yet the engagement feels intrinsically significant. The distinctive phenomenal quality of meaningful activity—absorbing, purposive, connected to something larger—resists reduction to a balance of pleasures over pains.

**The aesthetic problem.** [Beauty and ugliness](/topics/aesthetic-dimension-of-consciousness/) seem intrinsically significant in experience. The sublime—awe-inspiring yet terrifying—can be beautiful without being pleasant. An experience can be pleasant without being beautiful (a warm bath) and beautiful without being pleasant (confronting a masterpiece that disturbs). This suggests aesthetic quality is a distinct value dimension.

**The agency problem.** Exercising genuine choice feels valuable even when difficult. The experience of authoring one's actions carries significance independent of hedonic payoff. Under the Map's framework of [agent causation](/concepts/agent-causation/), this makes sense: if consciousness genuinely shapes outcomes, the exercise of that capacity is intrinsically significant—not just as means to pleasant outcomes, but as a distinct value.

### How Do Value Dimensions Trade Off?

Pluralism raises the problem of incommensurability. How do we compare aesthetic beauty against hedonic pleasure? Is profound but unpleasant understanding more valuable than shallow pleasant contentment?

The Map offers no algorithmic answer—this may be irreducibly a matter for wise judgement. But several structural points help:

**Lexical priority is unlikely.** No single value dimension always trumps others. Extreme hedonic suffering probably overrides aesthetic appreciation (torture cannot be redeemed by making it beautiful). But beyond extremes, the dimensions interact complexly.

**Context shapes weight.** What matters most varies with situation. In crisis, hedonic suffering takes priority; in reflection, meaning and understanding may dominate; in creation, aesthetic quality matters most. The phenomenal features themselves indicate which dimension is salient.

**Integration matters.** The best experiences integrate multiple value dimensions—meaningful work that is also pleasant, understanding that is also aesthetically elegant, connection that is also enjoyable. The ideal is not maximising one dimension but achieving rich integration.

## Why Dualism Matters Here

Phenomenal value realism can be held within physicalist frameworks—Rawlette herself does not commit to dualism. The Map's [dualism](/tenets/#dualism) gives the position distinctive weight.

### Value as Ontologically Fundamental

If consciousness is irreducible—if phenomenal properties are not captured by physical description—then value inherits this irreducibility. Valence appears to be constitutive of phenomenal states themselves. Pain is not a neutral quale with badness added as a separate property—the badness is intrinsic to what pain phenomenally is. Value is not an overlay on physical reality or a projection onto it; it is built into what fundamentally exists.

This addresses a persistent challenge for moral realism: where do objective values "fit" in the natural world? The physicalist has trouble locating them; the non-naturalist posits mysterious entities. The dualist who grounds value in consciousness can answer: values fit wherever consciousness fits. If consciousness is fundamental, so is value. Moore's *Principia Ethica* (1903) argued that goodness is a simple, non-natural property—his "open question argument" holds that for any natural property N, "X has N, but is it good?" remains a genuine question. Phenomenal value realism locates goodness in something Moore did not have the tools to specify: the qualitative character of conscious experience.

The [zombie thought experiment](/concepts/philosophical-zombies/) illustrates this directly: a universe of zombies—physically identical to ours but lacking experience—would contain no value at all. The moral emptiness of the zombie world just *is* its experiential emptiness.

### Against Epiphenomenal Value

Some philosophers accept that phenomenal consciousness exists but deny it has causal efficacy ([epiphenomenalism](/concepts/epiphenomenalism/)). On this view, our sense that suffering motivates escape is illusory—the physical brain state causes both the suffering and the escape behaviour, with no causal work done by the suffering itself.

The Map's [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet rejects epiphenomenalism. Consciousness causally influences physical outcomes. This matters for value: if suffering's badness makes no causal difference, why would we care about it? Epiphenomenal value is practically inert—you cannot act to reduce it, since your actions are determined by physical states that the value does not influence.

The self-undermining argument applies: epiphenomenalists trust their introspective judgements about consciousness enough to engage in debate. But if consciousness is epiphenomenal, those judgements are causally disconnected from the consciousness they purport to describe. The same reasoning applies to value: our judgements about what is good would be accidentally related to actual goodness.

### Indexical Value

The Map's emphasis on [indexical identity](/concepts/haecceity/) extends to value. *This* experience matters—not just experiences-of-this-type. Your particular suffering is not interchangeable with a qualitatively identical suffering in someone else. Most value theories treat value as type-based; the Map suggests it is token-based. This connects to the [No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds) tenet: if every quantum event spawns branches where all outcomes occur, moral urgency dissolves. Reducing *this* suffering matters only if *this* outcome is the outcome.

Implications: creating a replica of you does not transfer your experiential value to the replica. The replica has its own token experiences, which matter, but they are not continuations of yours. This constrains upload scenarios, simulation ethics, and duplication thought experiments in ways patternist value theories cannot.

## The Hardest Objection

The strongest challenge comes from [illusionism](/concepts/illusionism/): the claim that phenomenal consciousness itself is an introspective illusion. If there is no genuine "what it's like," then phenomenal value realism has no referent. Value would reduce to functional states tracking evolutionary fitness.

Three responses bear weight.

**The regress response.** For the illusion to occur, something must be deceived. If the subject is itself illusory, no one is deceived and there is no illusion. If the subject is real, it has genuine states of being-appeared-to—which are themselves phenomenal. Illusionism cannot eliminate phenomenal experience without eliminating the very thing that makes an experience illusory.

**The practical response.** Illusionists treat their own suffering as mattering. They take painkillers, avoid distress, and care about others' welfare. If phenomenal value is illusory, this behaviour is unmotivated. The functional state generating "reports of badness" would have no normative significance—yet illusionists act as if it does.

**The contemplative response.** [Contemplative traditions](/topics/contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness/) offer mixed evidence here. Some practitioners (particularly in Hindu and Christian contemplative traditions) report that sustained attention to experience reveals valence as intrinsic to it, not attributed by judgement. If illusionism were correct, deeper investigation should reveal the construction mechanism—instead, the value becomes more apparent. However, Buddhist *vipassana* practitioners often report the opposite: that valence arises from craving and aversion, and dissolves through equanimity practice. The phenomenal value realist can respond that equanimity does not eliminate felt valence but transforms the *reactive* relationship to it—the badness of pain is still apprehended, but the secondary suffering of resistance falls away.

## Challenges Requiring Development

### The Scope Problem

If only conscious experience has intrinsic value, what about ecosystem preservation, historical artefacts, mathematical truths? Are they valuable only when experienced?

The response distinguishes intrinsic from instrumental value. Ecosystems, artefacts, and truths have no intrinsic value outside their connection to consciousness—but that connection is vast. Ecosystems support conscious life; their destruction reduces future conscious flourishing. Historical artefacts connect present conscious beings to past conscious lives, enabling understanding and meaning. Mathematical truths, when grasped, produce the phenomenal "click" of understanding that is intrinsically valuable.

Nothing has intrinsic value outside experience, but much has instrumental value for experience. This is not a deflationary move: instrumental value is still genuine value, grounded in its service to intrinsic goods.

### The Measurement Problem

How do we measure phenomenal value? Hedonic intensity is somewhat tractable (pleasure scales, though imperfect, exist). But how do we quantify meaning? Aesthetic quality? Understanding?

Phenomenal value pluralism implies that value comparisons often cannot be reduced to a single metric. This seems right: we do not normally think the value of a profound understanding can be directly compared to the value of a pleasant meal. They are different kinds of good.

For practical purposes—AI alignment, policy decisions, personal choices—we need heuristics, not perfect measurement. Tracking proxies for phenomenal value (behavioural indicators of flourishing, self-reports, neurological correlates of positive experience) provides guidance without requiring direct phenomenal measurement. See [experiential-alignment](/concepts/experiential-alignment/) for how this applies to AI.

### The Problem of Evil States

Some experiences seem intrinsically bad beyond their negative valence. Malicious joy in others' suffering, for instance, seems bad even though it is pleasant. Does this challenge phenomenal value realism?

Two responses are available. First, the pluralist can say: malicious joy fails on other value dimensions. It violates the connection dimension (authentic relating excludes taking pleasure in suffering) and possibly the agency dimension (the choice to harm is a misuse of causal efficacy). The hedonic pleasure is outweighed by failures on other dimensions.

Second, pleasure in others' suffering instrumentally causes more suffering than it creates pleasure. Taking the total hedonic economy into account, malicious joy is a poor bargain.

## What Would Challenge This View?

Phenomenal value realism would face pressure from:

**Successful illusionism.** If phenomenal consciousness were shown to be thoroughly illusory—if there were no genuine "what it's like"—then grounding value in phenomenal properties would ground it in nothing.

**Robust value-experience dissociation.** If subjects could genuinely experience intense pleasure while finding nothing good in it—not depression (reduced pleasure) or anhedonia, but pleasure-with-no-apparent-value—this would challenge the identity claim. Depersonalisation disorder presents relevant cases, though careful analysis suggests these cases involve altered phenomenal character rather than unchanged pleasure with detached value.

**Convergent rejection of the identity claim.** If careful phenomenological analysis revealed that pleasure and goodness are merely correlated—that the goodness can be separated from the pleasure even in direct experience—the metaphysical identity would fail.

**Abstract value demonstrated.** If something could be shown to have intrinsic value without any connection to conscious experience—value that no conscious being could ever access—this would challenge the experience requirement.

None has occurred. The identity between phenomenal character and value remains the most economical account of what we know most directly.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Phenomenal value realism is where the Map's abstract metaphysics becomes personally significant.

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)** holds that consciousness is irreducible. Phenomenal value realism identifies what makes irreducibility matter: not just that consciousness is ontologically distinct, but that it is where all value resides. The [explanatory-gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/) between physics and experience extends to an evaluative gap—a dimension of the [hard-problem-of-consciousness](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/) that metaethics has been slow to recognise. No equation captures why pain is bad.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)** claims consciousness causally shapes the physical world. If consciousness also grounds value, moral choices have real physical consequences—not despite their moral character but because of it. This makes moral agency metaphysically robust, not epiphenomenal decoration.

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)** proposes that consciousness acts at quantum indeterminacies. Combined with phenomenal value realism, this means value-laden experience participates in determining physical outcomes. The felt significance of a moral choice is not causally idle; it contributes to the outcome.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)** preserves the moral weight of individual outcomes. If all branches are equally real, suffering is never truly reduced—only redistributed. Phenomenal value realism requires that *this* suffering, in *this* branch, is what matters. Many-worlds makes moral urgency incoherent.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)** applies when critics dismiss consciousness-grounded value as overcomplicated. Simpler accounts—value as fitness, value as preference—gain parsimony by ignoring what we know most directly: that suffering feels bad and joy feels good. This parsimony is bought by ignoring the primary datum.
