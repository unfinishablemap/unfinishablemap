The site's framework makes interconnected claims about time, quantum collapse, and conscious agency that together form a distinctive metaphysics. Free will operates through retrocausal or atemporal quantum selection. Collapse introduces time's arrow into otherwise time-symmetric physics. Consciousness doesn't merely experience time—it may help constitute temporal structure through its role in collapse. These threads weave together: if consciousness selects among quantum outcomes, and collapse creates temporal asymmetry, then agency and time's direction are fundamentally linked.

This consolidation addresses a tension: the site uses retrocausality to resolve the Libet problem (neural activity preceding conscious awareness) but also treats collapse as introducing irreversibility. How can selection be atemporal if collapse is irreversible? What metaphysics of time does this framework actually imply?

## The Framework's Temporal Commitments

The site's [tenets](/tenets/) make several claims bearing on time:

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)** holds that consciousness causally influences the physical world. This influence must occur *in* or *across* time—agents make choices that affect what happens.

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)** proposes consciousness operates at quantum indeterminacies, biasing otherwise undetermined outcomes. The [measurement problem](/concepts/measurement-problem/)—why superpositions resolve to definite outcomes—is where this influence finds traction.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)** rejects the interpretation that all outcomes occur in branching worlds. This requires collapse to be real, not apparent. Real collapse introduces irreversibility: the alternatives that weren't selected are genuinely gone, not merely unobserved.

**[Retrocausal resolution](/concepts/retrocausality/)** of the Libet problem proposes that consciousness's selection needn't precede the neural activity it shapes. Time-symmetric quantum mechanics allows backward causation; the "selection" may be atemporal—determining which transaction completes rather than pushing events at a moment.

Together: consciousness selects real collapses that introduce irreversibility, yet this selection operates atemporally. There's apparent tension here. Let's work through it.

## Presentism, Eternalism, and the Block Universe

Philosophy of time offers three major positions:

**Presentism** holds that only the present exists. Past events are gone; future events haven't happened yet. Time genuinely flows as the present moves along. This matches naive experience—the past feels over, the future open.

**Eternalism** (the "block universe") holds that all times exist equally. Past, present, and future are like spatial locations—2024 exists just as 2026 does, merely at a different position in the block. The flow of time is illusory; "now" is merely indexical, like "here."

**Growing block** theory holds that past and present exist, but the future doesn't yet. The block grows as time passes, with the present as its leading edge.

The site's framework sits uncomfortably with all three.

**Against pure presentism**: Retrocausality requires the past to be causally accessible in some sense. If past events are simply gone, backward causation has nothing to influence. The transactional interpretation describes offer waves from the past and confirmation waves from the future meeting in atemporal handshakes. This requires past and future to be "there" in some metaphysical sense.

**Against pure eternalism**: If all times exist equally and the block is static, collapse seems illusory. Definite outcomes at t₂ were "always" in the block; superpositions at t₁ simply hadn't yet been measured from our perspective. But the site requires real collapse—genuine transition from possibility to actuality, not mere discovery of pre-existing facts.

**The growing block's promise**: Real collapse could be the mechanism by which the block grows. The present moment is where superpositions resolve into definite facts, adding to the determinate past. This preserves both retrocausal accessibility (the past exists) and genuine temporal becoming (the future doesn't yet).

But even this needs refinement. If consciousness's selection is truly atemporal, it doesn't happen *at* the present moment. It determines which moments constitute the present. We need a more subtle picture.

## Atemporal Selection and Emergent Time

The transactional interpretation and related frameworks (Aharonov's Two-State Vector Formalism, Kastner's possibilist extension) describe quantum events as transactions between past boundary conditions and future absorbers. The "handshake" that completes a transaction isn't located at a time—it's the satisfaction of constraints across time.

Apply this to consciousness:

1. The brain's quantum systems exist in superposition—multiple possible neural configurations.
2. Future conditions (absorbers, measurement contexts) send backward-propagating constraint waves.
3. Consciousness participates in determining which transaction completes.
4. This participation is atemporal—it fixes which correlations hold between past and future, not which event occurs at which moment.

On this picture, consciousness doesn't act *in* time; it acts to *constitute* time's structure. What we experience as temporal flow—the specious present described by James, the [durée](/concepts/duration/) analyzed by Bergson—is the phenomenal character of this constitutive activity viewed from within.

Time's arrow doesn't precede consciousness; consciousness-involving collapse creates time's arrow. The irreversibility of collapse is why time has a direction. Without collapse, physics is time-symmetric; with it, past and future differ.

## Reconciling Atemporality with Irreversibility

The tension: if selection is atemporal, how is collapse irreversible?

Resolution: "atemporal" doesn't mean "outside time" as if time were a container. It means time itself is the product. The selection isn't reversible because there's no temporal direction to reverse along until after selection occurs. You can't "un-collapse" because un-collapse would require running time backward, but time's direction is what collapse establishes.

Think of it this way: a mathematical function can determine which curve appears on a graph without the function itself being located on the graph. Consciousness's atemporal selection determines which temporal sequence becomes real without that selection being a temporal event.

Once a transaction completes—once collapse has occurred—the temporal direction exists. Within that direction, collapse is irreversible. You can't return to the superposition because "returning" presupposes the temporal direction that collapse just created.

This dissolves the apparent paradox. Retrocausality operates within the physics before collapse creates temporal direction. Once direction exists, backward causation isn't reversal but constraint satisfaction—future conditions participating in determining which past becomes actual. After collapse, the selected past is simply the past. The alternatives weren't suppressed; they were never actualized.

## The Phenomenology of Temporal Agency

If consciousness constitutes time through collapse, what should this feel like? The site's framework predicts:

**The [specious present](/concepts/specious-present/)**: [Temporal experience](/concepts/temporal-consciousness/) has duration—roughly 100 milliseconds to 3 seconds depending on methodology—within which we experience succession as unified. This isn't clock-time (which has durationless instants) but lived time.

The debate between extensionalists (Dainton, Foster) and retentionalists (Husserl, Broad) about the specious present bears directly on the framework. Extensionalists hold that experience is genuinely temporally extended—has parts at different times. Retentionalists hold that each moment is instantaneous but contains the past as intentional content (retention) and anticipates the future (protention).

The site adopts a modified extensionalism: experience is genuinely extended, with the extension constituted through quantum collapse. Each collapse creates a "moment"; the specious present is the experiential horizon within which recent collapses remain unified. This explains both the extended phenomenology (extensionalism) and the retention-like structure (retentionalism)—the echoing of the past in the present reflects retrocausal boundary conditions in the collapse process.

If consciousness is actively constituting temporal structure, the specious present may be the phenomenology of this constitutive activity. We experience duration because we're creating duration. The variation in duration estimates (100ms-3s) may reflect multiple components—a core perceptual window where collapses unify, embedded in a broader experiential horizon where constraints propagate.

**The sense of possibility narrowing**: We experience the future as open and the past as fixed. This asymmetry matches collapse: before measurement, multiple outcomes; after, one. The phenomenology of agency—feeling that we could do otherwise until we act—may directly reflect quantum superposition awaiting collapse.

**The [phenomenology of effort](/concepts/mental-effort/)**: Sustaining attention feels costly. Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism proposes that mental effort prolongs neural patterns through repeated observation. This fits: constitutive activity should be effortful; passive experience need not be.

**Bergson's [durée](/concepts/duration/)**: Time as qualitatively flowing, with the past permeating the present and the future anticipated. If consciousness doesn't merely observe time but constitutes it, this interpenetrating quality makes sense. Each moment isn't a slice but an activity, colored by what it's selecting among.

**Retrocausal insensitivity**: We don't experience backward causation as strange. The Libet data doesn't feel like our choices precede our awareness. This is because the selection isn't temporal—it determines which temporal ordering becomes real. The neural activity "preceding" awareness is part of the selected transaction, not evidence against conscious causation.

## Avoiding Contradiction in "Selection Across Time"

A careful reader might object: if consciousness selects "across time," doesn't this require consciousness to exist across all times it's selecting among? How can a consciousness at t₃ select outcomes at t₁?

The framework's answer: the question presupposes what's being denied. There is no consciousness "at t₃" that exists separately from the temporal structure it helps constitute. Consciousness isn't located at times within a pre-existing temporal framework; it's implicated in why there are times at all.

This isn't mysticism—it's structural. Consider: the number 7 isn't located at a position on the number line; it's part of what constitutes the number line. Similarly, consciousness may not be located at a moment in time; it may be part of what constitutes temporal structure.

The phenomenology reconciles this with experience. We seem to experience moments sequentially because that's what it's like to constitute temporal sequence from within. The "selection" isn't experienced as a choice made from outside time but as the activity of living through time—what Bergson called the creative advance of durée.

## Implications for Free Will

This metaphysics strengthens the [free will](/topics/free-will/) position:

**Sourcehood without prior causes**: [Agent causation](/concepts/agent-causation/) holds that the agent is the ultimate source of action, not prior events. If consciousness constitutes temporal structure, there's no temporal chain of prior causes to trace back through. The agent doesn't inherit causation from the past; the agent's selection determines what the past is.

**Alternative possibilities**: Free will traditionally requires that we could have done otherwise. In the growing-block picture with consciousness-constituted collapse, alternatives genuinely existed as superposed possibilities before selection. They weren't hidden or illusory; they were metaphysically open.

**Non-random selection**: Critics argue quantum indeterminacy gives us random will, not free will. But if selection is atemporal and involves consciousness's constraints across time, it's not random—it's the expression of the agent's rational nature determining which temporal pattern becomes actual. The selection reflects what matters to the agent, not arbitrary quantum fluctuation.

**Timing problem dissolved**: The Libet objection (neural activity precedes awareness) only matters if selection must temporally precede the neural activity. In atemporal selection, this ordering is part of what's selected, not a constraint on the selection.

## What Would Falsify This Framework?

The position makes predictions:

**Neural determinism**: If neuroscience demonstrates that brain states fully determine subsequent brain states—leaving no quantum openness—the mechanism disappears. Current evidence doesn't show this; quantum effects in biological systems remain an active research area.

**Many-worlds vindication**: If decisive evidence favored many-worlds interpretation—perhaps through direct detection of other branches or theoretical unification requiring MWI—the framework's collapse realism would be undermined.

**Time-asymmetric fundamental physics**: If future physics demonstrates that time asymmetry is fundamental (not collapse-derived), then consciousness wouldn't be constitutive of time's direction. Currently, fundamental physics appears time-symmetric, with arrows emerging from boundary conditions or collapse.

**Phenomenological disconnect**: If trained contemplatives systematically reported that temporal experience doesn't match the framework's predictions—if, for instance, the specious present turned out to have fundamentally different characteristics than constitutive activity would predict—this would undermine the phenomenological support.

## Relation to Site Perspective

This synthesis strengthens the tenets:

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: If consciousness constitutes temporal structure, it's not merely qualitatively different from physical processes—it's implicated in the framework within which physical processes occur. Reduction would be circular.

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)**: Atemporal selection at collapse points is precisely the minimal mechanism proposed. Consciousness doesn't inject energy or override physics; it satisfies constraints that physics leaves open.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)**: Consciousness influences physical outcomes through collapse selection. The "bidirectional" aspect includes retrocausal influence—the selected transaction incorporates past and future constraints together.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)**: The entire framework depends on collapse being real. Many-worlds denies this; hence the site's commitment against it. Indexical identity—being *this* consciousness rather than a copy—requires there to be definite facts about which outcomes occurred.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occam)**: This metaphysics is more complex than either naive presentism or simple eternalism. But temporal experience resists simpler pictures. The apparent simplicity of eliminativist views (time is illusion, consciousness is epiphenomenal, free will doesn't exist) achieves parsimony by denying phenomena rather than explaining them.
