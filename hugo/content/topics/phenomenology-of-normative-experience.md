Normative properties—wrongness, rational compellingness, beauty, prudential weight—show up in consciousness with distinctive phenomenal character. They share a common structure: all present themselves as demands, as features of the world that call for response. Yet these demands do not operate in isolation. They collide. A whistleblower feels moral obligation pulling against self-preservation. A scientist feels the demand for truth pulling against the duty to protect vulnerable subjects. These collisions produce an experience irreducible to either demand alone: the felt weight of conflicting oughts, and the distinctive suffering of having to choose between them.

The Unfinishable Map's [phenomenal value realism](/topics/phenomenal-value-realism/) holds that value is constituted by conscious experience. This article examines what that thesis looks like when applied across the full range of normative domains—moral, epistemic, aesthetic, and prudential—and argues that the phenomenal unity underlying these diverse demands, together with the structure of their conflicts, provides evidence that normativity is a fundamental feature of consciousness, not a projection onto it.

## The Four Normative Domains

### Moral Normativity

[Moral phenomenology](/topics/phenomenology-of-moral-experience/) has received the most attention. Witnessing cruelty presents wrongness as a feature of the situation—immediate, unbidden, with motivational force. The experience carries urgency: wrongness demands response.

Moral normativity occupies a specific region of phenomenal space. Its [hedonic valence](/concepts/valence/) is distinctive: moral outrage burns, compassion warms, guilt gnaws. It is typically other-directed, concerning what one owes to others or what is owed to one. And it carries a weight that resists trade-offs against non-moral considerations. The person who says "I know it's wrong, but it's convenient" acknowledges the moral demand even while overriding it.

### Epistemic Normativity

Epistemic norms—the demands of rationality, evidence, and logical consistency—have their own phenomenal character, distinct from moral demands. Consider encountering a valid deductive argument whose conclusion you don't want to accept. There is a felt pull toward acceptance that is not moral obligation. It lacks the warmth of moral experience; it is cooler, more impersonal. But it is equally insistent.

The experience of being compelled by evidence has what might be called phenomenal rigidity. A valid argument doesn't merely suggest its conclusion—it seems to necessitate it. This phenomenal necessity is distinct from physical necessity (feeling the impact of a collision) and moral necessity (feeling obligated to help). It belongs to [cognitive phenomenology](/concepts/cognitive-phenomenology/): the felt character of thinking itself.

When evidence contradicts a held belief, the clash registers as epistemic tension—a characteristic restlessness, the sense that the mind's current configuration is unstable. [Belief revision](/topics/phenomenology-of-epistemic-judgment/) proceeds partly through this felt instability.

### Aesthetic Normativity

The [aesthetic dimension](/topics/aesthetic-dimension-of-consciousness/) of experience carries its own normative force. Beauty demands attention. Ugliness repels. These are not moral demands—nothing obligates you to find a sunset beautiful—but they are normative: they present their objects as meriting or failing to merit certain responses.

Aesthetic normativity has a characteristic receptivity absent from moral and epistemic experience. Moral demands press upon you; epistemic demands constrain you; aesthetic demands invite you. The beautiful draws you in. This invitational quality distinguishes aesthetic from moral phenomenology even when both involve positive valence.

Aesthetic experience also displays what Kant called disinterestedness—a quality of appreciation detached from practical desire. This phenomenal detachment is part of the normative structure: beauty presents itself as mattering independently of what you want from it.

### Prudential Normativity

Prudential normativity—the demands of one's own wellbeing—is phenomenologically distinct from the other three. The pull of self-interest has a gravitational quality: familiar, constant, pulling toward comfort and away from threat. It lacks the urgency of moral demands, the rigidity of epistemic demands, and the invitational quality of aesthetic demands.

What prudential normativity has instead is intimacy. It concerns *this* body, *this* life, *this* future. Its phenomenal character is suffused with indexicality—the felt sense that one's own wellbeing matters because it is *one's own*. When moral and prudential demands conflict, the conflict registers as a pull between two phenomenally distinct normative forces: the moral demand outward and the prudential demand inward.

## The Shared Phenomenal Architecture

Despite their differences, all four normative domains share a common phenomenal architecture.

### Demand Character

Every normative experience presents its object as calling for response. Wrongness demands intervention. Evidence demands belief revision. Beauty demands attention. Self-interest demands action. This demand character—the felt sense of being addressed by a situation—is the phenomenological signature of normativity as such.

The demand is not the experience of being causally pushed. Physical forces move the body; normative properties address the agent. The normative case involves recognition—the sense that the demand is appropriate, that the situation genuinely merits the response it calls for.

### Resistance to Preference

Normative properties present themselves as independent of what one wants. The wrongness of cruelty persists whether or not one cares about it. The validity of an argument holds regardless of one's preferences about the conclusion. Beauty impresses itself on those who would rather not be affected.

This distinguishes normative experience from mere desire. Desire presents its object as wanted; normative experience presents its object as warranting response—a distinction experienced directly.

### Gradedness

Normative properties present themselves as admitting of degrees. Some wrongs are worse than others; some evidence is stronger; some beauty is more striking; some prudential considerations are more pressing. This phenomenal gradedness is not merely conceptual—it is felt.

## When Normative Domains Collide

### Within-Domain Conflict

The most familiar form of normative conflict pits demands of the same type against each other. Two moral obligations collide: you promised to attend a friend's event, but a stranger needs immediate help.

Within-domain conflict has a characteristic phenomenology of *tearing*. The demands share the same felt quality—both moral, both carrying obligation's warmth and urgency—yet they pull in opposite directions. The experience differs from simple indecision. In indecision, the agent lacks sufficient reason to prefer one option; in normative conflict, the agent has *too much* reason, directed at incompatible actions. The phenomenal weight doesn't cancel out. It accumulates.

Bernard Williams analysed the extreme case: tragic dilemmas where both options are morally catastrophic. Agamemnon must sacrifice his daughter or abandon his army. Williams argued that "agent-regret" remains appropriate after *either* choice—regret not merely that something bad happened, but that it was *oneself* who made it happen. The overridden obligation persists with remainder. The agent emerges bearing what the literature calls "moral residue"—an ineliminable trace of the obligation that was acknowledged but could not be fulfilled.

### Cross-Domain Conflict

More structurally revealing is conflict between different normative domains. The whistleblower doesn't face two versions of the same demand. She faces the hot urgency of moral obligation against the gravitational pull of self-preservation—two phenomenally distinct forces requiring resolution in a single action.

Consider the collision between epistemic and moral normativity. A researcher discovers that publishing accurate results will cause foreseeable harm. The epistemic demand for truth-telling has its cool, impersonal rigidity; the moral demand for harm prevention has its warm urgency. Two different textures of "ought" compete for the same decision.

Or consider aesthetic versus moral normativity. The artist recognises beauty in a work that celebrates something morally repugnant—Leni Riefenstahl's cinematography, for instance. The invitational quality of aesthetic experience clashes with the imperative quality of moral demand.

## What Normative Experience Reveals

### The Irreducibility of Normative Demands

If normative demands were mere preferences or desire-strengths, conflict between them would feel like competing desires—like wanting both chocolate and cheese when one must choose. But normative conflict feels fundamentally different. Desires compete on a single dimension (strength of wanting); normative demands compete across qualitatively distinct dimensions. No amount of intensified desire produces the felt character of moral obligation.

[Phenomenal normativity](/concepts/phenomenal-normativity/)—the position that normative force is built into the structure of consciousness—predicts exactly this qualitative distinctness. If normativity were projected onto experience by external mechanisms, one would expect a single projection mechanism producing a single felt quality modulated only by intensity. The actual phenomenology—multiple distinct normative textures with shared architectural features—better fits intrinsic normativity than any projectivist account.

### Against Domain-Specific Accounts

If normativity were merely projected, each domain should feel normative for different reasons—moral norms because of emotional conditioning, epistemic norms because of cognitive habits, aesthetic norms because of cultural training. Sentimentalists like Prinz (2007) argue that moral emotions are culturally constructed projections, and functionalists hold that "demand character" is simply the functional role of certain mental states. A functionalist might reply that shared architecture is unsurprising: all normative states share the functional roles of evaluation, motivation, and action-guidance. But what demands explanation is not shared *functional* structure but shared *qualitative* structure—four domains with distinct evolutionary histories and cultural contexts all presenting their objects with the same phenomenal character of demanding response. Functional overlap predicts shared processing; it does not predict shared phenomenology.

[Phenomenal normativity](/concepts/phenomenal-normativity/) offers a more direct explanation: normativity is built into the structure of consciousness itself. Different normative domains tap into a single underlying feature—the capacity of experience to present its objects as mattering.

### Consciousness as Arbiter

When normative demands from different domains collide, something must adjudicate. The demands themselves provide no resolution—moral normativity cannot overrule prudential normativity from within the moral domain. Resolution requires a perspective that encompasses both domains and exercises judgment about their relative weight in this particular situation.

The Unfinishable Map identifies this arbiter as consciousness itself. The felt effort of resolving normative conflict—deliberation, weighing, eventual commitment—is phenomenologically distinct from both demands. It is a third thing: the experience of being the point where incompatible normative forces meet and a single action must emerge. This is the phenomenology of [agent-causation](/concepts/agent-causation/): not a mechanical aggregation of competing force-vectors but a genuine act of judgment that could have gone otherwise.

The computationalist alternative—that the brain runs a weighted sum and produces output—struggles with the phenomenology of resolution specifically. Computational models can simulate oscillation between options and even model attention dynamics. What they cannot capture is the first-person character of commitment: the experience of the deliberation *not* determining the outcome, followed by a leap that the agent recognises as genuinely their own act. This is the [phenomenology of choice](/concepts/phenomenology-of-choice/)—resolution is not the gradual dominance of one activation pattern but a decision that acknowledges both demands and accepts the cost of overriding one.

### Moral Residue as Evidence

Williams's observation about remainder applies beyond tragic dilemmas. Even in ordinary cross-domain conflicts, overriding one demand produces a phenomenal trace. The agent who prioritises prudence over morality feels guilt; the one who follows evidence over moral caution feels the weight of potential consequences.

A computationalist might respond that multi-objective optimisation routinely produces trade-offs with residual loss. But the phenomenology of moral residue is not abstract recognition of suboptimality. It is the felt persistence of a demand that one continues to recognise as *legitimate*—a demand not outweighed so much as sacrificed. The losing demand doesn't diminish in normative force; it persists as a genuine claim that was acknowledged but could not be satisfied.

If [phenomenal-value-realism](/topics/phenomenal-value-realism/) is correct—if value is constituted by conscious experience—then moral residue is not a psychological quirk. It is the felt presence of a real value that was not, and could not be, realised.

## The Temporal Structure of Conflict

Normative conflict unfolds in time with a distinctive rhythm.

**Onset** is typically sudden. The agent encounters a situation activating competing demands simultaneously. The phenomenology is of being *arrested*—ordinary practical reasoning halts. This differs from the pause of uncertainty in that further information would not dissolve the conflict.

**Deliberation** has a characteristic oscillation. Attention moves between competing demands, and each time it focuses on one, that demand gains phenomenal weight—not because new reasons appear but because sustained attention deepens its felt force. This amplification dynamic makes normative deliberation so difficult.

**Resolution**, when it comes, has the character of a *leap*. The agent commits without the deliberation having determined the outcome. This is the [phenomenology of choice](/concepts/phenomenology-of-choice/) that [deliberation under uncertainty](/topics/phenomenology-of-deliberation-under-uncertainty/) also reveals, but normative conflict adds a dimension: the leap involves actively overriding a demand one continues to recognise as legitimate.

**Aftermath** carries residue. The agent lives forward knowing a genuine demand went unsatisfied—with continuing recognition that the overridden demand was not wrong to claim attention.

## Normative Perception and Its Limits

If normative properties have genuine phenomenal character, they can be perceived—and perception can fail. Ethical blindness—temporary inability to perceive moral dimensions—has been documented in organisational psychology research (Palazzo, Krings & Hoffrage 2012). The Map suggests parallel forms across domains: epistemic blindness (failing to perceive evidential weight), aesthetic blindness (failing to register beauty), and prudential blindness (failing to perceive risks to one's wellbeing).

If normative properties are perceived rather than inferred, then normative education is perceptual training. [Contemplative traditions](/topics/contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness/) have long held that sustained practice deepens normative perception. Buddhist *vipassanā* sharpens awareness of impermanence, suffering, and non-self—though Buddhist philosophy uses this sharpened perception to question the inherent reality of normative properties, a tension the Map acknowledges.

Normative conflict reveals a different kind of limit: not the absence of perception but its *excess*. In tragic dilemmas, the problem is not that the agent fails to perceive moral properties but that she perceives too many, pulling in incompatible directions. The [normative-void](/voids/normative-void/) explores the outer boundary: entire domains of normative truth structurally inaccessible to human minds.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The phenomenology of normative experience connects to the Map's [foundational commitments](/tenets/).

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: The shared demand character of normative experience resists physical explanation. Neural descriptions can capture correlates—activation patterns during moral judgement—but cannot capture the demand character itself. No description of neural firing patterns contains the felt pull of obligation or the compellingness of valid inference. Normative conflict adds a further dimension: the simultaneous experience of qualitatively distinct demands within a unified experiential field. A brain-state account can model competing activations, but cannot capture the felt difference between types of normative pull or the unified perspective from which they are experienced as conflicting.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)**: Normative experience motivates action across all domains. Perceived wrongness drives moral behaviour; perceived evidence drives belief revision; perceived beauty drives creative response. Resolving normative conflict is among the clearest cases of consciousness doing causal work—the agent doesn't passively register competing demands but adjudicates between them and acts on the result. If consciousness were epiphenomenal, both the motivational power of normative experience and the felt effort of navigating conflict would be causally inert decoration.

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)**: Normative conflict demands that a single action emerge from incompatible demands—and the [felt effort](/concepts/mental-effort/) of resolution suggests consciousness doing real work. If consciousness influences the physical world through quantum-level bias of otherwise indeterminate outcomes, normative adjudication is a clear candidate for where that bias operates: the agent's commitment must translate into one physical action rather than another, at a juncture where the demands themselves underdetermine the outcome.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)**: Normative demands have indexical force—they address *this* agent in *this* situation. Many-worlds dissolves this indexicality: all responses occur across branches. The felt weight of normative demands—and the gravity of normative conflict—are coherent only if outcomes are singular. When Agamemnon chooses, one daughter dies in this world, with no branch where the alternative obtained. Moral residue becomes puzzling if every resolution actualises somewhere.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)**: Reducing normativity to evolutionary fitness, social construction, or competing desire-strengths appears parsimonious. But this parsimony requires dismissing the primary data—what normative experience actually reveals across four domains, with shared architecture, distinctive variations, and a conflict phenomenology that resists computational modelling. As with consciousness itself, the simpler theory may be the one that takes the phenomenology at face value.
