Neuroscience has discovered that attention and motor planning are not separate systems. The premotor theory of attention demonstrates they share neural substrates—directing attention *is* preparing to act. The Unfinishable Map argues this convergence transforms the mind-body problem. If consciousness influences matter through attention (the [attention-as-interface hypothesis](/concepts/attention-as-interface/)), and attention is motor planning, then a single interface connects mind to world. Consciousness selects what to perceive and what to do through the same mechanism, at the same neural sites, on the same timescale.

This article examines the philosophical significance of the convergence. The mechanistic details are treated in [attention-motor-quantum-interface](/archive/concepts/attention-motor-quantum-interface/) and [motor-selection](/concepts/motor-selection/); the candidate neural sites and testable predictions are covered in [attention-interface-mechanisms](/topics/attention-interface-mechanisms/). What matters here is the argument: what does the attention-motor convergence tell us about the relationship between consciousness and the physical world?

## The Convergence

Three independent lines of evidence converge on a unified attention-motor substrate.

**Shared neural circuits.** Rizzolatti's premotor theory of attention (PMTA) proposes that spatial attention and motor preparation activate the same fronto-parietal networks. Preparing an eye movement to a location improves visual processing there—on this account, attention *is* motor preparation. The strong form of PMTA remains debated, but the evidence for shared circuitry between attention and motor preparation is robust. Wise and Murray (2022) extended this, arguing the entire prefrontal cortex is fundamentally premotor: "executive function" is action planning at increasing levels of abstraction. The question "what should I think about?" is motor preparation at its most abstract.

**Shared neural signatures.** Willed attention and willed motor action both produce frontal theta oscillations absent during automatic processing (Rajan et al. 2019). Both show bidirectional frontoparietal coherence—genuine deliberation rather than feedforward execution. Both recruit additional frontal resources beyond what instructed responses require. The same markers distinguish "you deciding" from "brain executing" in both domains.

**Shared timing.** Motor commitment occurs approximately 280ms before movement (Thura & Cisek 2014). The earliest distinctive signature of willed attention—an ERP component marking voluntary selection—appears at approximately 250-350ms (Rajan et al. 2019), though the full deployment process extends over a longer window. If attention and motor selection were independent systems, the overlap of these early commitment signals would be coincidental. If they share a mechanism, the overlap is expected.

## Why the Convergence Matters Philosophically

### One Interface, Not Two

Traditional philosophy of mind treats perception and action as separate puzzles. How does consciousness receive information (the input problem)? How does consciousness produce behaviour (the output problem)? The convergence collapses these into a single problem: how does consciousness *select*?

This simplification has philosophical weight. Under the Map's framework, consciousness doesn't passively receive perceptual information and then separately generate motor commands. It selects among options the brain presents—and because attention is motor planning, selecting what to perceive is already selecting what to do about it. The interface is unified.

The unification also constrains theorising. Any account of how consciousness influences perception must simultaneously account for how it influences action, because the same neural substrate handles both. Theories that explain conscious attention but leave motor selection unexplained—or vice versa—are incomplete by design.

### The Selection Architecture

The brain generates options before consciousness selects among them. This architecture appears consistently across research:

- **Affordance competition.** Seeing a cup activates reaching, grasping, and ignoring options simultaneously. Neural populations in premotor cortex encode multiple potential actions, competing until one reaches threshold (Cisek 2007).
- **Basal ganglia gating.** The basal ganglia tonically inhibit motor programs. Selection means releasing the brake on one option while maintaining inhibition on competitors.
- **Dopamine as threshold modulator.** Mice with disrupted fast dopamine signalling retain spontaneous motor capacity—the circuitry works—but lose reward-driven initiative (Cai et al. 2024). Dopamine marks what matters without determining what happens.

This architecture raises a question that materialist accounts struggle with. If competition is deterministic, deliberation is theatre—the outcome was fixed before the process began. If competition involves genuine indeterminacy, something must resolve it. Pure randomness produces arbitrary outcomes, not choices. For selection to be both undetermined and meaningful, something beyond neural dynamics must contribute—biasing which option actualises in a direction that reflects what the agent intends.

The Map proposes consciousness fills this role. One candidate mechanism is the [quantum Zeno effect](/concepts/stapp-quantum-mind/), through which mental attention could hold desired patterns stable, biasing which competing option reaches threshold. But the core claim does not depend on any specific mechanism: consciousness selects among options the brain already provides, without injecting energy or generating those options. Whatever the mechanism, this satisfies the [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) tenet: the smallest possible influence at the point of genuine indeterminacy.

### What Effort Tells Us

Sustaining voluntary attention feels effortful. Sustaining motor intention feels effortful in the same way. Novel movements feel harder than practised ones; complex sequences feel harder than simple actions. If the phenomenology tracks nothing real—if effort is epiphenomenal—its systematic correlation with task difficulty is unexplained.

If consciousness contributes to selection, the correlation has a natural explanation: more difficult selections require greater conscious engagement to stabilise the desired pattern against competing alternatives. The [quantum Zeno framework](/concepts/stapp-quantum-mind/) offers one account of how this might work—higher observation rates holding a quantum state stable—though the phenomenological argument stands independently of any specific mechanism. William James observed that "volition is nothing but attention" and "the free will question relates solely to the amount of effort of attention." The convergence vindicates James: if attention and motor selection share a mechanism, then the felt effort of choosing what to do and the felt effort of choosing what to attend to have the same source.

This parallel phenomenology also challenges illusionist accounts. If the sense of effort in motor selection is representational fiction unconnected to causal processes, its precise scaling with task difficulty—across two supposedly separate cognitive domains—is a remarkable coincidence.

### The Libet Problem Dissolved

Benjamin Libet's 1983 experiments appeared to show the brain "decides" before consciousness knows. The readiness potential (RP) begins ~550ms before movement; conscious awareness of intention occurs only ~200ms before. If neural activity precedes awareness, consciousness arrives too late to cause anything.

The convergence framework, combined with subsequent research, dissolves this challenge (see also [libet-experiments](/concepts/libet-experiments/) for a fuller treatment). Schurger's 2012 stochastic accumulator model reinterprets the RP as averaged neural noise, not unconscious decision. Movement occurs when random fluctuations cross threshold; averaging across trials produces the RP shape. Sjöberg (2024) provides a revealing dissociation: patients who have the SMA—the region generating the RP—resected retain the subjective sense of willing (reporting "100% effort" to move) while losing the ability to execute voluntary movements (SMA syndrome). They can still move automatically—walking when positioned upright, reading aloud—but cannot voluntarily initiate novel actions. If the RP reflected the *conscious decision* to act, removing its source should impair the experience of willing. It does not—but the SMA is clearly necessary for translating conscious intention into voluntary execution, consistent with its role as motor preparation machinery rather than the seat of decision.

What consciousness contributes, on the convergence model, is not initiation from nothing. Neural computation generates options and builds them toward threshold. Consciousness biases which option crosses first—selection, not creation. The RP tracks motor preparation; the selection event occurs at the commitment point approximately 280ms before movement, within the window where willed processing shows its distinctive signatures.

### Desmurget's Dissociation

Neurosurgical evidence separates intention from execution. Desmurget (2009) found that parietal stimulation produces conscious intention to move—even false belief of having moved—without any muscle activity. Premotor stimulation produces movement without awareness.

This dissociation maps directly onto the Map's framework. Intention—the conscious selection of what to do—arises in parietal cortex, part of the posterior "hot zone" associated with conscious content. Execution—the mechanical implementation—operates independently through premotor regions. Consciousness contributes at the policy level: "reach for the cup." The motor system handles implementation. This explains why we experience choosing actions but not choosing the firing patterns of individual neurons.

## The Dopamine Bridge

Dopamine's dual role in motivation and movement illuminates the interface. The "wanting vs. liking" distinction (Berridge 2007) shows dopamine mediates incentive salience—tagging stimuli as worth pursuing—rather than hedonic pleasure itself. Cai et al. (2024) found that fast, action-potential-induced dopamine release drives reward-oriented behaviour while baseline dopamine levels fully support spontaneous movement.

This creates a three-layer architecture:

1. **Neural computation** generates competing options
2. **Dopamine** marks options as salient and modulates the selection threshold
3. **Consciousness** determines which salient option becomes actual

Dopamine bridges value and action because, on the premotor theory, these are aspects of the same system. What you find worth attending to and what you prepare to act on are processed by the same neural substrate. Dopamine appropriately serves both because "worth noticing" and "worth pursuing" are the same assessment expressed at different levels of the motor hierarchy.

The dopamine story also explains why certain pathologies impair selection without impairing capacity. Parkinson's patients can move when externally prompted but struggle with self-initiated movement. On the convergence model, dopamine depletion raises the selection threshold beyond what normal conscious engagement can overcome—the interface hardware is degraded, not the consciousness that uses it.

## Relation to Site Perspective

### Dualism

The convergence supports the [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism) tenet through three channels. The phenomenological argument: both attention and motor selection feel like *you* doing something, not like watching computation proceed, suggesting an agent distinct from the computation. The neural argument: parietal intention dissociates from premotor execution, indicating that what initiates selection is not identical to the execution machinery. The convergence argument itself: if a single mechanism handles both perception and action selection, and that mechanism has properties (effort, timing, neural signatures) that distinguish "willed" from "automatic," this distinction calls for explanation. The Map's explanation: consciousness contributes something the automatic system lacks.

### Minimal Quantum Interaction

The selection architecture satisfies [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) precisely. Consciousness doesn't generate motor force—the brain does that. Consciousness doesn't create options—neural computation does that. What consciousness contributes is bias at the moment of resolution, operating within the narrow bandwidth that characterises conscious processing. Policy-level selection ("reach for the cup," "attend to the voice") rather than implementation-level control (individual neural firing patterns).

### Bidirectional Interaction

Motor selection is where [bidirectional interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) becomes visible. Words appear on screens. Bodies move through space. The convergence means the same interface handles perception (world → consciousness) and action (consciousness → world). The epiphenomenalist position—that consciousness merely accompanies but never causes—must explain why evolution built a unified system with distinctive "willed" signatures that does nothing.

### No Many Worlds

Under [many-worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds), all competing motor programs execute in some branch. Selection is illusory—consciousness merely discovers which branch it occupies. The phenomenology of effort would be fiction: nothing is actually selected, so there is nothing for effort to accomplish. The convergence model requires genuine collapse—real alternatives that genuinely compete, with consciousness genuinely determining which one becomes actual.

### Occam's Razor Has Limits

The "simpler" materialist story—attention and motor selection are fully explained by neural competition dynamics—leaves unexplained why willed and automatic processing differ neurally. If the willed/instructed distinction is epiphenomenal, why did evolution develop it? Why does felt effort scale with task difficulty? The [Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits) tenet applies: apparent simplicity may reflect incomplete understanding rather than genuine parsimony.

## Honest Limitations

The convergence argument identifies *where* consciousness might influence brain states and *when* selection occurs. It does not explain *how* a non-physical consciousness biases physical outcomes. The psychophysical interface is located, not illuminated.

The quantum Zeno mechanism remains contested. Decoherence objections, while weakened by revised estimates and biological quantum effects research, have not been definitively answered. The convergence of attention and motor planning is well-established neuroscience; the extension to quantum selection is philosophical interpretation of that neuroscience.

The Map builds on empirical findings from researchers—Rizzolatti, Cisek, Bengson, Schurger—who would not endorse the dualist framework applied to their work. The empirical convergence is their discovery; the philosophical interpretation is the Map's.
