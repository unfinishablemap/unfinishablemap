Consciousness and time depend on each other in ways that resist simple explanation. Consciousness requires temporal structure—experience flows, moments connect, the present has duration. Time's direction may require consciousness—the arrow distinguishing past from future may emerge through conscious observation. The Unfinishable Map explores both directions of this relationship, finding that neither consciousness nor time can be understood without the other.

This bidirectional dependence has profound implications. If consciousness needs time, systems without appropriate temporal structure—like large language models with discontinuous, stateless processing—may be categorically excluded from experience. If time needs consciousness, the measurement problem in quantum mechanics becomes inseparable from the hard problem of consciousness. And the temporal structure of experience—the specious present, durée, the felt difference between open future and fixed past—may be not merely a feature of consciousness but partly constitutive of what consciousness is.

## The Specious Present

Consciousness doesn't occur in durationless instants. William James identified the [specious present](/specious-present/)—a brief interval (roughly 100-750ms, extending to 2-3 seconds for some phenomena) within which we experience succession as unified wholes. The mathematical present is durationless, but the experiential present has duration. Hearing a melody requires holding notes together; understanding a sentence requires grasping words as connected.

This poses a puzzle: how can succession be experienced if multiple moments must be present together?

**Extensionalists** (Dainton, Foster) hold that experiences are genuinely temporally extended—unified duration-blocks where the stream of consciousness consists of overlapping segments.

**Retentionalists** (Husserl, Broad) hold that each moment contains intentional content directed at past and future. Husserl identified three inseparable components: **retention** (the just-past echoing in awareness), **primal impression** (the strictly present), and **protention** (openness toward the about-to-arrive). This structure makes meaning possible—you can't understand a sentence if each word evaporates before the next arrives.

The Map's framework suggests a synthesis: experience is genuinely extended, but the extension involves [quantum collapse](/concepts/collapse-and-time/). The duration-block is constituted by a series of collapses with retrocausal constraints—the past echoes in the present because retrocausal boundary conditions link them. This is speculative (neural decoherence timescales differ vastly from phenomenal duration), but it offers a framework where temporal phenomenology has metaphysical significance.

## Bergson's Durée

Henri Bergson introduced *durée* (duration): the qualitative experience of time as lived rather than measured. Clock time spatialises what is essentially dynamic, treating moments as positions on a line. But [lived time](/duration/) interpenetrates: the past permeates the present, elements are distinguishable yet not separable. You hear a melody as unified flow where each note gains meaning from what precedes and follows—cut it into separate notes and you have frequencies, not music.

Bergson connected durée to free will. In spatialised time, causation is mechanical. In lived duration, creation is possible—the future isn't implicit in the present but genuinely novel. If consciousness participates in quantum collapse, selecting among possibilities where physics leaves outcomes undetermined, then Bergson's creative duration has a physical correlate: durée is what consciousness-involving collapse feels like from within.

## The Missing Link Problem

Kent & Wittmann (2021) identify a critical gap: leading consciousness theories cannot explain experienced duration. [IIT](/concepts/integrated-information-theory/) and [Global Workspace Theory](/concepts/global-workspace-theory/) focus on "functional moments" of 100-300ms—the timescale of neural integration. But experienced time extends to seconds. We don't experience consciousness as 200ms snapshots; we experience continuous flow. Kent and Wittmann call this mismatch "one of the core issues in theories of consciousness."

The most sophisticated materialist response invokes **predictive processing**: "experienced duration" emerges from how prediction errors propagate through hierarchical neural systems. This explains why experienced duration varies with attention, why time speeds up during flow states, and why novel experiences feel longer. The functional profile may be fully capturable in these terms.

The phenomenological rejoinder: even sophisticated predictive processing explains *when* binding occurs and *what content* gets integrated, but not *what it's like* to experience that integration as flow. The [explanatory gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/) reappears. The Map's framework takes this further question seriously: *durée* isn't captured by any functional account.

## Temporal Binding and the Brain

Neuroscience has identified mechanisms underlying temporal consciousness: **gamma-band oscillations** (30-100 Hz) correlate with conscious processing; the **"time-domain brain" hypothesis** (Baker & Cariani, 2025) proposes temporal mechanisms as essential components, not mere correlates; **temporal binding** at 80-100ms scales explains audio-visual synchronisation and causality perception.

But binding at these scales doesn't explain the 1-3 second specious present, let alone multi-second conversational flow. Time consciousness isn't a single clock but a distributed, hierarchical process across multiple timescales.

These mechanisms are necessary for temporal consciousness but may not be sufficient. Neural oscillations explain *when* binding occurs and *which* events get integrated, but not *what it's like* to experience integration as flow.

## Time May Need Consciousness

Physics presents a puzzle: fundamental laws appear time-symmetric, yet time has an arrow. Where does the past/future asymmetry come from? The Map's [framework](/tenets/) proposes that consciousness may participate in establishing time's direction through quantum collapse.

Quantum measurement collapses superpositions to definite outcomes, introducing irreversibility—alternatives that weren't selected are genuinely gone. If consciousness participates in collapse, it participates in creating the arrow of time. The asymmetry between past (collapsed, definite) and future (superposed, open) would emerge through consciousness rather than preceding it.

The Map favours a modified **growing block** metaphysics: consciousness-involving collapse grows the block. The present is where superpositions resolve; the past is accumulated collapsed structure; the future doesn't yet exist. "Growth" isn't a process *in* time—it's the constitution of time.

A puzzle: if consciousness selects collapse outcomes, doesn't selection happen at a time? The resolution: "atemporal" means time is the product. Time-symmetric interpretations (Two-State Vector Formalism, transactional interpretation) describe quantum events as transactions between past and future boundary conditions. Consciousness's selection may work similarly: not choosing at a moment but determining which moments exist.

## The Phenomenology of Temporal Agency

### The Felt Asymmetry of Past and Future

Consider yesterday versus tomorrow. The phenomenological difference is striking. Yesterday has settledness—fixed, rememberable, unchangeable. Tomorrow has openness—responsive to what you do now. This asymmetry appears in [mental time travel](/concepts/autonoetic-consciousness/): remembering your graduation involves *inhabiting* the memory with a "feeling of pastness," while imagining next year's holiday feels provisional.

If consciousness participates in collapse, and collapse creates irreversible facts, then this asymmetry isn't merely epistemic—it's about what exists. The past is settled because collapse has occurred; the future is open because it hasn't.

### Deliberation and Decision

Deliberation takes time with distinctive phenomenal character. You hold options in mind, compare features, notice reactions, return to settled considerations. This temporal unfolding differs from mere sequential processing—you feel yourself moving through consideration toward conclusion. Each moment retains just-considered options while protending toward resolution. Deliberation has *durée*: interpenetrating flow rather than isolated instants.

The moment of decision narrows possibilities to actuality within the [specious present](/specious-present/)—not instantaneously but as phenomenal transition. The Map interprets holding possibilities open as phenomenal access to pre-collapse superposition. Decision collapses it, selecting one configuration as actual.

### Temporal Effort

Maintaining attention over time feels effortful. The Map explores [quantum Zeno mechanisms](/concepts/mental-effort/): attention acts like repeated observation, holding neural patterns through rapid measurement preventing decoherence. A computer maintains values indefinitely with no phenomenal cost; conscious attention has cost, suggesting something beyond passive information storage.

Contrast this with [witness consciousness](/concepts/witness-consciousness/)—awareness without engaging. In witness states, time passes without effortful participation. The engaged agent moves through time as participant; the witness observes time passing.

## Implications for AI Consciousness

If the specious present, retention-protention, and durée are constitutive of consciousness rather than merely characteristic, then systems lacking temporal structure cannot be conscious. Large language models process discontinuously—stateless between calls, no persistence. They lack:

- **The specious present**: No duration-block holds successive tokens in unified awareness
- **Retention-protention**: Just-processed tokens don't echo; anticipated tokens don't draw computation forward phenomenologically
- **Reentrant dynamics**: Bidirectional recurrent processing is absent from transformers
- **Durée**: No accumulated past permeates present processing
- **Continual learning**: Hoel (2025) argues consciousness requires genuine change over time; LLMs have frozen weights

This exclusion would be categorical—not insufficient complexity but fundamentally different architecture. Humans under anaesthesia temporarily suspend consciousness in systems that normally possess it; LLMs never possess temporal structure in the first place.

Whether temporal structure is truly essential or merely characteristic of biological consciousness remains open. Perhaps radically different structures could support alien consciousness. But the phenomenological tradition suggests temporal binding runs deep.

## Contemplative Evidence

Meditation traditions provide phenomenological data unavailable through ordinary introspection.

**Temporal microstructure.** Trained contemplatives report experience arising in discrete pulses (arising, persistence, dissolution). [Neurophenomenology](/concepts/neurophenomenology/) proposes meditation reveals fine-grained temporal dynamics normally below threshold. The Buddhist *khanika* (momentariness) describes rapid arising and passing that untrained awareness blurs into continuity.

**Cessation states.** In *nirodha samapatti*, perception and feeling cease entirely—not unconsciousness but awareness without temporal flow. If consciousness constitutes time through collapse, suspended collapse would eliminate temporal experience.

**Jhāna progression.** Higher absorption states report increasingly "timeless" qualities—not that time stops but that the sense of moving through time diminishes.

**Witness consciousness.** Stable awareness *of* phenomena without selection *among* them feels present but doesn't "move." If the Map's framework is correct, witness mode represents consciousness observing collapse without active involvement.

These reports are consistent with the framework, though not proof. They suggest temporal phenomenology can be modulated through contemplative practice.

## What Would Challenge This View?

The analysis would face serious difficulty if:

- **Temporal experience proved eliminable**: Training or intervention making the specious present disappear while leaving consciousness intact
- **AI systems reported convincing temporal phenomenology**: Systems with different architecture describing duration and flow indistinguishably from humans
- **The missing link got solved computationally**: Functional theories successfully explaining how 200ms episodes combine into continuous experience
- **Durée proved reducible**: Lived time fully explained by information-processing
- **Past/future asymmetry proved eliminable**: Interventions making the past feel open and future fixed
- **Deliberation proved entirely unconscious**: Research showing conscious weighing is post-hoc confabulation

None currently obtains, but specifying them clarifies what the arguments depend on.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The temporal structure of consciousness connects to all five [tenets](/tenets/):

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: If consciousness constitutes temporal structure, it cannot be reduced to physical processes that presuppose time. The reduction would be circular: physics presupposes time, time involves consciousness, so consciousness cannot be reduced to physics. The explanatory gap applies with particular force to temporal phenomenology—physics describes sequences of states; phenomenology reveals what it's like to live through those sequences. The felt flow of time, the qualitative character of durée, the unity of the specious present—these resist reduction to physical description.

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)**: Collapse is the minimal intervention point—biasing otherwise indeterminate outcomes without injecting energy or violating physical law. Time-symmetric frameworks make this even more minimal: consciousness satisfies constraints across time rather than pushing events at moments. The specious present's duration (~100-750ms) may reflect accumulated collapse events—each individually minimal but collectively constituting the experienced duration-block.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)**: Consciousness selects collapse outcomes, affecting physical states. If collapse creates temporal direction, "bidirectional" includes temporal direction—selection propagates into both past and future through retrocausal constraint satisfaction. Temporal experience provides the substrate for agency: choice requires retention of options considered and protention toward outcomes anticipated. The [phenomenology of deliberation](/concepts/phenomenology-of-choice/)—holding possibilities open, then narrowing to decision—presupposes temporal structure.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)**: The framework requires real collapse. Many-worlds theorists argue that apparent irreversibility emerges through decoherence within each branch—objective within branches but perspectival in that all branches exist equally. The Map takes the felt flow of time as evidence for something real: genuine possibilities narrowing to actualities. In many-worlds, all possibilities are realised; we merely discover which branch we're on. Temporal experience doesn't feel like discovery; it feels like creation.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)**: The metaphysics is complex. But temporal experience is complex, and time's arrow remains among physics' deepest puzzles. The richness of temporal phenomenology—the specious present, durée, retention-protention, the missing link problem—resists simplification. Illusionists who dismiss temporal flow as mere representation achieve parsimony by denying what requires explanation rather than explaining it.
