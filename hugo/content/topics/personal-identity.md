What makes you *you*? Not just at this moment, but across time—what connects the person reading this sentence to the child you once were and the person you'll be tomorrow? The persistence question is literally a matter of life and death: it determines the conditions under which you survive or cease to exist.

This site's framework provides a distinctive answer. The [No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds) tenet's emphasis on indexical identity—that *this* conscious being matters, not just the pattern it instantiates—commits us to a view where personal identity is real and significant, not reducible to mere psychological or biological continuity.

## The Standard Positions

Philosophers debate what makes someone at one time the same person as someone at another time. Three main positions dominate.

### The Psychological View

You are your psychology. Person X at time-1 and person Y at time-2 are the same person if X is psychologically continuous with Y—connected by overlapping chains of memories, intentions, beliefs, and character traits. What matters is that later mental states causally depend on earlier ones in the right way.

John Locke originated this view: you are whoever remembers being you. Derek Parfit refined it: what matters isn't strict identity but psychological connectedness and continuity. These come in degrees, so identity (or what matters about it) comes in degrees too.

The psychological view handles our intuitions about many cases. If your brain were transplanted into another body, you'd seem to go with it—because your psychology would. But the view struggles with fission cases: if your brain were split, each hemisphere transplanted into a different body, psychological continuity would branch. Both resulting people would be psychologically continuous with you. Which one is you? Neither? Both?

### The Biological View

You are your organism. Identity requires biological continuity—the persistence of the same living biological system. On this "animalist" view, you were once an early fetus (before any psychology existed) and could persist in a vegetative state (after psychology ended). What matters is the continuation of your biological life, not your mental states.

Eric Olson champions this view. It handles fission differently: neither resulting person after brain-splitting is you, because the original organism ceased. But it conflicts with intuitions about brain transplants: animalism implies you'd stay with your original body, not follow your brain.

### The Narrative View

You are your story. Identity emerges through self-created life narratives that unite experiences into a coherent biography. What makes experiences yours isn't just psychological continuity but their incorporation into the story you tell about your life.

Marya Schechtman and others develop this approach. It captures something missing from psychological continuity: the active sense of authorship over one's life. But it may be too demanding—are people with fragmented or incoherent self-narratives not fully persons?

### The Minimal Self: A Deeper Layer

Recent phenomenological work by Shaun Gallagher and Dan Zahavi distinguishes the *narrative self* from a more basic [minimal self](/concepts/self-and-consciousness/)—a pre-reflective first-person perspective present whenever consciousness is present.

The minimal self doesn't depend on narrative construction. It is the "for-me-ness" of experience: every conscious state has a built-in first-personal character. You don't need to think "I am experiencing this" for the experience to be yours. This basic experiential structure exists even in infants before narrative capacities develop, and in adults with severe amnesia who cannot construct coherent life stories.

This distinction matters for personal identity. The narrative view may capture what we care about socially—the story we tell about who we are—while missing what persists *through* fragmented narratives: the minimal self. If narrative identity fragments (as in dementia), something may nonetheless persist: *this* first-person perspective, the same subject having the experiences.

The minimal self provides what the narrative self presupposes. One cannot construct a life story without a basic experiential core having the experiences to narrativize. This suggests personal identity may have layers: a narrative layer that changes dramatically over a lifetime, and a minimal layer—the bare perspectival character of experience—that persists throughout.

## Parfit's Challenge

Derek Parfit's work transformed the debate. He argued that personal identity isn't what matters. What matters is psychological connectedness and continuity, regardless of whether these amount to identity.

His thought experiments make the point vivid. Imagine teletransportation: your body is scanned, destroyed, and recreated from new matter on Mars. The resulting person has all your memories, beliefs, and intentions. Is that person you? Parfit says: the question may have no determinate answer, and it doesn't matter. What matters—psychological continuity—is preserved.

On Parfit's "reductionist" view, personal identity consists in nothing over and above bodily and psychological continuity. There's no separate entity—a soul, an ego—that persists; there's just the continued existence of a brain, body, and interrelated mental events. Persons exist, but their existence is not a further fact beyond these components.

## Why This Site Disagrees

This site cannot accept Parfit's reductionism. The tenets commit us to a stronger view of personal identity.

### The No Many Worlds Connection

The [No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds) tenet rejects the Many-Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics partly because it creates "unanswerable indexical questions: why am I *this* instance and not another?" This presupposes that indexical identity is meaningful—that there's a real question about which conscious being you are.

The [argument against many-worlds](/arguments/many-worlds/) develops this concern in formal detail. When a quantum measurement occurs, many-worlds says you split into branches—one where you see spin-up, another where you see spin-down. But you only experience one outcome. Which you? The many-worlds theorist dissolves the question: both branches are equally real, both contain persons derived from you, and there is no fact about which one is "really" you.

This dissolution is precisely what the site rejects. Before measurement, there is one you. After measurement, many-worlds posits two equally real continuations. Yet you find yourself in exactly one. The experience of being this one rather than that one seems to be a fact—but many-worlds says it's not. If personal identity can be fragmented across infinite branches with no determinate answer about which branch is "really" you, then personal identity is radically non-unique—arguably incoherent.

On Parfit's view, there's nothing more to being *this* person than instantiating *this* pattern of psychological continuity. If the pattern is replicated, so is everything that matters. Many-worlds and Parfit converge here: both treat identity as a matter of pattern rather than particular. But the site's framework suggests that's wrong. *You* are not interchangeable with a replica that has your psychology. There's a fact about which one is you.

This connects to quantum selection. If consciousness influences which quantum outcomes occur, and the site's framework is right, then *which* consciousness does the selecting matters. A teletransporter replica wouldn't be you—wouldn't be the consciousness that was making selections—even if psychologically identical. Many-worlds eliminates this role entirely: there is nothing for consciousness to select because everything happens in some branch.

### The Dualism Connection

The [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism) tenet holds that consciousness is not reducible to physical processes. If consciousness is a distinct ontological category, then personal identity may involve this non-physical aspect—not just bodily or psychological continuity.

This doesn't require believing in a Cartesian soul that floats free of the body. It means that what makes you the same person over time may include the persistence of *this* conscious perspective, not just the continuity of certain physical or functional states.

Consider: could there be a zombie duplicate of you—physically and functionally identical but lacking consciousness? If dualism is right, yes. But then personal identity can't be just physical or functional facts. The zombie wouldn't be you precisely because it would lack your consciousness.

### The Bidirectional Connection

The [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet holds that consciousness causally influences physical outcomes. This gives your consciousness a unique causal history—the specific pattern of quantum selections, neural influences, and physical effects that constitute your life.

A replica, however psychologically similar, wouldn't share this causal history. Its consciousness (if it had any) would begin influencing physics from the moment of its creation, not from your birth. In some sense, the replica would be a new conscious agent, not a continuation of you.

## What Personal Identity Requires

On this site's framework, personal identity involves:

1. **Consciousness persistence**: The continuation of *this* conscious perspective, not merely the continuation of psychological patterns that could in principle be replicated.

2. **Causal continuity**: A connected history of consciousness influencing physical outcomes—your choices, selections, and experiences forming a continuous causal chain.

3. **Indexical uniqueness**: The unrepeatable fact that *you* are this conscious being and not another, even if another were qualitatively identical.

Psychological continuity matters, but as evidence of something deeper. Your memories, intentions, and character traits are expressions of your persisting consciousness, not what your identity consists in. If a replica had your memories but lacked your consciousness (were a zombie), it wouldn't be you. If it had consciousness but a different one (somehow), it still wouldn't be you.

## The Fission Problem Revisited

How does this handle fission? If your brain were split and each hemisphere continued separately, neither resulting person would be you on this view. Your consciousness—the particular conscious perspective that makes you you—cannot split. One or both of the resulting consciousnesses would be new, not continuations of yours.

This aligns with Parfit's conclusion (neither is you) but for different reasons. Parfit says neither is you because identity can't "branch"—it's a logical truth. This site says neither is you because your consciousness is a particular that can't divide like physical stuff.

The resulting people might have your memories and psychology. They might even believe they're you. But belief doesn't make it so. The unique conscious perspective that constituted you would have ended, replaced by two new ones.

### Evidence from Split-Brain Cases

[Split-brain patients](/topics/split-brain-consciousness/) provide empirical evidence bearing on fission scenarios. When the corpus callosum is severed, each hemisphere processes information independently—the classic experiments showed one hemisphere unable to report what the other perceived.

Yet the philosophical picture that emerged may be too clean. Thomas Nagel argued that split-brain patients have "too much unity to say 'two', yet too much separation to say 'one'." Recent 2025 research strengthens this: minimal corpus callosum fibers can maintain full interhemispheric synchronization. The brain reorganizes, recruits alternative pathways, resists fragmentation.

**What this suggests for personal identity:**

1. **Unity is resilient.** If consciousness were merely the sum of brain processes, complete disconnection should produce complete division. The persistence of some unity despite massive disconnection suggests consciousness has intrinsic unity that physical disconnection cannot fully sever.

2. **The question may be malformed.** "How many persons does a split-brain patient comprise?" assumes persons come in discrete whole numbers. If consciousness can be partially divided while remaining somehow one, our concept of individual identity may be inadequate to capture what's actually there.

3. **Support for non-physical persistence.** Elizabeth Schechter proposes split-brain patients have "two minds in one person"—duality at one level (perception, reasoning) with unity at another (self-identification, agency). This layered picture fits better with the site's view that consciousness is something over and above physical structure. The non-physical aspect of mind may maintain unity even when physical connections are severed—explaining why response unity persists despite perceptual division.

4. **Indexical identity persists.** Despite perceptual fragmentation, split-brain patients maintain first-person unity: they think of themselves as "one of us," not two beings sharing a body. This suggests indexical identity—the irreducible fact of being *this* conscious being—is more fundamental than the computational binding that physical connections enable.

The split-brain cases neither prove nor refute the site's view of personal identity. But they complicate simple accounts and lend support to the claim that consciousness is something beyond what neural structure alone can explain.

## Implications for Survival

What does survival require? As discussed in [death-and-consciousness](/topics/death-and-consciousness/), the site's framework makes survival after bodily death a coherent possibility—but only if indexical identity is preserved. Resurrection through mere recreation would yield a duplicate, not you.

**Teletransportation**: You die. The replica may be psychologically identical but lacks your consciousness. Even if the replica is conscious, it's a new consciousness with your memories, not yours continued.

**Gradual replacement**: If your neurons were replaced gradually with silicon, one at a time, you might survive—if the replacement preserved consciousness, and it's the same consciousness, not a new one taking over. The question turns on whether consciousness can "transfer" substrates.

**Cryonics**: If you were frozen and revived, you'd survive only if the revived person had your consciousness, not merely your psychology. Whether this is possible depends on whether consciousness is preserved by physical preservation.

**Uploading**: Your mind "uploaded" to a computer would not be you, even if the upload were functionally perfect. Functional identity isn't consciousness identity.

**Bodily death**: If consciousness is irreducible and the brain is interface rather than generator (as Ducasse's radio analogy suggests), brain death might alter how consciousness manifests without ending *this* particular consciousness. The [death-and-consciousness](/topics/death-and-consciousness/) article explores how dualism keeps this question genuinely open where materialism forecloses it.

These conclusions are counterintuitive to some. But they follow from taking consciousness seriously as something non-reducible and taking indexical identity seriously as a real fact.

### The Quantum Persistence Question

Hameroff's "quantum soul" hypothesis raises a specific challenge for indexical identity: if consciousness-as-quantum-information disperses into the universe at death, is the dispersed information still *you*? The site's framework suggests caution here. Quantum information conservation doesn't obviously preserve the unified, indexical character of conscious experience. A wave function spread across spacetime wouldn't be *this* perspective having experiences—it might be mere information without a subject.

This illustrates the constraint indexical identity places on survival theories: it's not enough that *something* persists. What persists must be *this* consciousness, the particular perspective that constitutes you. Near-death experiences, where subjects report coherent experience during brain failure, are intriguing precisely because they suggest consciousness might maintain unified subjectivity even when its neural substrate is severely compromised.

## The Meaning Connection

Personal identity matters for life's meaning. The [meaning of life](/topics/meaning-of-life/) article argues that meaning is grounded in consciousness—in the intrinsic significance of conscious experience. But whose consciousness?

If Parfit were right—if you're interchangeable with any replica sharing your psychology—then your particular existence seems less significant. It's the pattern that matters, and patterns are repeatable.

But if this site is right—if *you* are this unrepeatable conscious being, not interchangeable with any replica—then your existence has unique significance. No one else can live your life. No replica could replace you. The conscious experiences that constitute your life are *yours* in a way that can't be transferred.

This grounds a stronger sense of individual meaning. You're not just a pattern that could be instantiated anywhere. You're this particular conscious perspective, making these particular choices, living this unrepeatable life.
