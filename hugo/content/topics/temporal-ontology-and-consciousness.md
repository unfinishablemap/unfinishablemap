The Unfinishable Map argues that positions on time and positions on consciousness are not independent. Choosing eternalism pushes toward functionalism or illusionism about temporal experience. Choosing presentism struggles to accommodate consciousness's causal role. The growing block—where past and present exist but the future does not—turns out to be the temporal ontology most naturally paired with dualist interactionism. These pairings are not accidental. The metaphysics of time constrains what consciousness can be, and what consciousness turns out to be constrains which temporal ontology is viable. They form package deals, and recognising this narrows the philosophical landscape considerably.

## The Three Temporal Ontologies

The [philosophy of time](/concepts/philosophy-of-time/) offers three major positions on what exists. **Eternalism** (the block universe) holds that past, present, and future are equally real—time is a fourth spatial-like dimension, and "now" is indexical rather than ontologically privileged. **Presentism** holds that only the present moment exists—the past has vanished, the future hasn't arrived. The **growing block** holds that past and present exist but the future does not yet—reality accumulates as time passes.

Each makes different claims about temporal passage. Eternalism denies it: nothing "flows," and the sense of passage is perspectival. Presentism affirms it but struggles to explain what the present is passing *into*—if the future doesn't exist, there's nothing for the present to become. The growing block locates passage at the frontier where new reality is constituted.

These are not mere technicalities. Each ontology makes temporal experience either central, peripheral, or illusory—and that determination shapes what consciousness can be.

## Eternalism and the Consciousness Problem

Eternalism is the default assumption in modern physics. Relativity treats time as a dimension, and the relativity of simultaneity means there is no universal "now." This gives eternalism scientific credibility. But it creates a distinctive problem for consciousness.

If all times are equally real, temporal flow is illusory. The experience of "now" moving from past to future is a subjective overlay on a static four-dimensional structure. This forces a choice. Either consciousness is a real feature of the block—in which case, why does it systematically misrepresent reality by producing an illusion of flow? Or temporal experience accurately tracks something real—in which case, eternalism is incomplete.

The natural pairing is eternalism with [functionalism](/concepts/functionalism/) or [illusionism](/concepts/illusionism/). If consciousness is functional—if what matters is the computational pattern, not the substrate—then temporal experience is whatever the neural/computational pattern produces, and its accuracy about time's nature is irrelevant. Illusionism goes further: the seeming of temporal flow is a representational artefact, and there is nothing it is like beyond the functional state that misrepresents stasis as passage.

This pairing is coherent but costly. The cost is Bergson's [durée](/concepts/temporal-consciousness/)—the qualitative, interpenetrating, irreducible flow of lived time. If temporal experience is illusory or merely functional, durée is an error. The melody you hear as unified flow is really a sequence of discrete states, each statically existing at its spacetime location, with "flow" injected by the brain's representational machinery. Every moment of experienced passage is a kind of mistake.

The Map regards this cost as too high. Temporal phenomenology is among the most robust features of conscious experience. Building a metaphysics that begins by declaring this phenomenology illusory is like building an epistemology that begins by declaring perception unreliable—technically possible, but it undermines the evidence base for the theory itself.

## Presentism and the Causal Gap

Presentism takes temporal experience at face value: only the present is real, and passage is genuine. This honours the phenomenology. But it creates a different problem for consciousness.

If only the present exists, causation becomes puzzling. Causes precede effects, but on strict presentism the cause no longer exists when the effect occurs. The past exerts no influence because it isn't there. This is already problematic for physics, but it's devastating for consciousness.

Conscious experience depends on temporal integration. The [specious present](/concepts/temporal-consciousness/)—the experienced duration within which we hear melodies and understand sentences—requires the just-past to be retained within the present. Husserl's retention structure preserves the past note while the current note sounds. But if the past literally doesn't exist, what is being retained? Retention becomes a representation of nothing.

Presentism pairs naturally with epiphenomenalism or with views that treat consciousness as present-moment awareness without causal depth. If consciousness is exhausted by the instantaneous present, its temporal richness must be reconstructive—memory representations masquerading as retained experience. The past note isn't echoing in the present; the brain is creating a present-moment representation *as if* it were echoing. This collapses the distinction between genuine temporal experience and a snapshot that contains the illusion of duration.

For the Map's purposes, presentism also struggles with [collapse and time's arrow](/concepts/collapse-and-time/). If collapse creates irreversibility—if consciousness participates in the transition from quantum superposition to definite outcome—then the collapsed past must exist in some sense. Its definiteness is what distinguishes it from the still-open future. Presentism, by abolishing the past, loses the asymmetry between settled past and open future that makes collapse meaningful.

## The Growing Block's Fit with Dualist Interactionism

The [growing block](/topics/growing-block-universe-and-consciousness/) preserves what the other ontologies sacrifice. The past exists (unlike presentism), so retention and causal inheritance are genuine relations to real things. The future doesn't yet exist (unlike eternalism), so temporal passage and openness are real. The present is the frontier where new reality is constituted.

This ontology pairs naturally with the Map's dualist interactionism:

**Temporal experience is veridical.** The growing block vindicates durée. Flow is real because reality is genuinely accumulating. The past pervades the present because the past exists and causally influences the present. The future is genuinely open because it doesn't yet exist. Conscious experience of temporal passage tracks an ontological feature of reality rather than constructing an illusion.

**Consciousness at the growing edge.** If the present is where new reality is constituted, and if consciousness participates in [collapse](/concepts/collapse-and-time/)—the process by which quantum superposition becomes definite outcome—then consciousness operates at the ontological frontier. The growing block needs a mechanism for growth, and consciousness-involving collapse provides one. Collapse resolves indeterminacy, adding new definite facts to the accumulated block. Consciousness doesn't merely witness the block's growth; it participates in constituting it.

**Causal efficacy is genuine.** Because the past exists and the future is open, consciousness's causal role is straightforward. Past collapsed states constrain present possibilities; consciousness selects among remaining open possibilities; the selection becomes a new definite fact added to the block. The Libet timing problem dissolves under [retrocausal](/concepts/retrocausality/) interpretations: selection determines which temporal sequence becomes actual rather than occurring at a point within a pre-existing sequence.

**The hard problem deepens productively.** If consciousness participates in constituting temporal structure—if it's part of what makes the block grow—then reducing consciousness to physical processes becomes circular. Physical processes occur within temporal structure; temporal structure is partly constituted by consciousness; therefore, consciousness cannot be fully explained by the physical processes it helps make possible. This circularity doesn't prove dualism, but it reveals that the relationship between consciousness and physics is more intimate than reduction allows.

## Why the Pairings Hold

These pairings are not arbitrary philosophical marriages. They hold because temporal ontology determines what temporal experience *can be*, which constrains what consciousness *must be*.

If time is a static block, temporal experience is non-veridical, so consciousness must be the kind of thing that can be systematically wrong about the basic structure of reality. Functionalism and illusionism accommodate this—they don't require consciousness to accurately track metaphysical structure. Dualist views that take phenomenology seriously cannot easily accept that temporal experience is fundamentally mistaken.

If only the present exists, temporal integration is reconstructive, so consciousness must be the kind of thing that manufactures apparent duration from instantaneous states. This pushes toward deflationary accounts of experience—thin present-moment awareness supplemented by memory representations.

If the block grows, temporal experience can be veridical, consciousness can have genuine causal depth, and the phenomenology of passage tracks something real. This is the environment where dualist interactionism finds its natural home.

The constraint also runs in the other direction. If consciousness is irreducible and causally efficacious (as the Map's tenets assert), then the temporal ontology must accommodate real causal powers and genuine temporal phenomenology. Eternalism makes causal powers perspectival. Presentism makes temporal depth illusory. Only the growing block provides the ontological structure that matches what dualist consciousness requires.

## Objections and Responses

**The relativity objection.** Special relativity's lack of a universal "now" seems to refute the growing block. But the growing block need not identify the growth frontier with a single hyperplane of simultaneity. Collapse events may define local presents that don't require a global simultaneity surface. The relationship between quantum collapse and relativistic spacetime remains an open problem in physics—the growing block is no worse off than any collapse interpretation.

**The "now" problem.** Why is the growing edge *now* rather than at some earlier point? On a static reading, every past moment was once the edge. The growing block's response: the edge is constitutively special. It's not that one slice of the block is labelled "now"—it's that the edge is where indeterminacy resolves into fact. Consciousness marks this edge because consciousness participates in the resolution.

**The simplicity objection.** Eternalism is simpler—one block, no growth, no privileged present. This is where the Map's [fifth tenet](/tenets/#occams-limits) applies. Simplicity purchased by denying the phenomenology of temporal passage is not genuine economy. A theory that explains everything except the thing we know most directly—our own temporal experience—has a simplicity that hides rather than reveals.

## Relation to Site Perspective

This article's argument—that temporal ontology and consciousness theories form package deals—supports all five of the Map's [tenets](/tenets/):

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: The package-deal argument shows that taking temporal phenomenology seriously (as dualism does) requires a temporal ontology that makes experience veridical. The growing block provides this, while eternalism forces consciousness theories toward illusionism or functionalism—positions incompatible with irreducible phenomenal experience.

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)**: The growing block's need for a growth mechanism aligns with consciousness's role in collapse. The interaction is minimal—biasing indeterminate outcomes—but ontologically significant: it's what makes the block grow.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)**: The growing block makes causal efficacy genuine rather than perspectival. Consciousness acts at the frontier, selecting outcomes that become permanent additions to accumulated reality. The past constrains; consciousness selects; new facts result.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)**: Many-worlds requires eternalism (all branches equally real) and denies collapse. The growing block requires real collapse and a single accumulating reality. Rejecting many-worlds and adopting the growing block are mutually reinforcing commitments.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)**: The package-deal argument illustrates exactly how parsimony can mislead. Eternalism looks simpler but achieves simplicity by exiling temporal phenomenology to illusion. The growing block is more complex but accommodates more of what we actually know.
