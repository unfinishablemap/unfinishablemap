How little neural complexity can support consciousness? The question matters for ethics (which organisms deserve moral consideration?), for philosophy (where does experience interface with matter?), and for the [hard problem](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/) itself (can we identify the minimal conditions for subjectivity?). Research on simple organisms—from the 302-neuron nematode *C. elegans* to nerve-free slime molds—challenges assumptions about what consciousness requires while revealing the fundamental difficulty of detecting experience from the outside.

The Unfinishable Map's dualist framework gains unexpected support from this research. If consciousness were merely emergent from physical complexity, we should expect a clear gradient from non-conscious matter to conscious beings. Instead, the evidence presents a puzzle: organisms with radically different architectures display behaviours that resist easy classification. For dualism, this is exactly what we would expect: if consciousness interfaces with physical systems rather than emerging from them, the question "where is the threshold?" may have no principled answer at all.

## The 2024 New York Declaration

In April 2024, over 500 scientists and philosophers signed the New York Declaration on Animal Consciousness, significantly expanding the 2012 Cambridge Declaration. Where Cambridge affirmed consciousness in mammals, birds, and cephalopods, New York extends to "a realistic possibility of conscious experience" in all vertebrates and many invertebrates, including insects, crustaceans, and other arthropods. Signatories include David Chalmers, Christof Koch, Peter Godfrey-Smith, Lars Chittka, and Anil Seth.

The declaration's precautionary stance is notable: "If there's a realistic possibility of conscious experience in an animal, it is irresponsible to ignore that possibility." This represents a shift from requiring proof of consciousness to acknowledging that uncertainty itself carries moral weight. The Map endorses this epistemic humility—consistent with the [Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits) tenet.

## Three Model Organisms

### *C. elegans*: The Conscious Nematode?

The roundworm *C. elegans* is the most thoroughly mapped organism in neuroscience: exactly 302 neurons, 8,000 chemical synapses, 890 gap junctions. We know its complete [neural connectome](/concepts/neural-correlates-of-consciousness/). Yet we cannot determine whether it experiences anything.

The evidence for minimal consciousness in *C. elegans* is tantalising but inconclusive:

**For consciousness:**
- Exhibits habituation, sensitization, and associative learning
- Possesses an endogenous opioid system related to the mammalian one
- Responds to anesthetics (isoflurane, ketamine) similarly to vertebrates
- Shows positive Phi (integrated information) values in computational models
- Displays transgenerational memory effects

**Against consciousness:**
- Fails trace-conditioning paradigms—a critical test for unlimited associative learning
- Exploratory behavior resembles "biased random walk" rather than goal-directed navigation
- No evidence of complex multimodal integration
- No demonstrated self-other distinction

As researchers ask: "Is there something that feels like to be a worm? Or are worms blind machines?"

### Hydra: Consciousness Without Centralization?

The freshwater Hydra possesses approximately 900 neurons arranged in a decentralized nerve net—no brain, no ganglia, no central processing. Multiple non-overlapping neural networks control different behaviors: one for somersaulting, another for feeding, another for prey capture.

What Hydra reveals is startling: nerve-free Hydra can survive indefinitely (when force-fed) but lose prey detection and feeding behavior. The nervous system appears to enable specific behaviors rather than create some general capacity for experience. Hydra shows habituation and sensitisation but no published evidence of associative learning.

The Hydra case challenges assumptions that consciousness requires centralized processing. If subjective experience arises from neural activity, must it be unified? Or could experience be as distributed as Hydra's nerve net—multiple micro-experiences without [phenomenal unity](/concepts/unity-of-consciousness/)?

### Slime Molds: Cognition Without Neurons

*Physarum polycephalum*, the yellow slime mold, possesses no neurons whatsoever. It is a single-celled organism. Yet it solves mazes, optimizes network routes to match Tokyo's rail system, and displays habituation. Its "memory" traces are encoded in extracellular slime—recoverable, transferable, overwritable.

The slime mold case divides researchers sharply:

**Cognitivists** argue Physarum demonstrates "basal cognition"—information processing functionally equivalent to rudimentary thought. Some propose a "proto-consciousness mechanism" in single-celled organisms.

**Skeptics** maintain these behaviors are biochemical reactions, however sophisticated. Maze-solving follows nutrient gradients; no phenomenal experience is required.

For the Map's framework, slime molds present a puzzle. If [quantum effects in microtubules](/concepts/quantum-consciousness/) provide the interface for consciousness, organisms without neurons (and thus without microtubules) shouldn't exhibit cognitive behaviors—yet they do. This suggests either that quantum neural interfaces are sufficient but not necessary for cognition, or that cognition and consciousness can fully dissociate.

The [decoherence objection](/concepts/decoherence/)—that quantum coherence cannot survive in warm biological systems—applies differently to organisms of varying complexity. In single-celled organisms without neurons, the question of quantum consciousness interfaces may not arise at all. Slime molds may process information through entirely classical biochemical mechanisms while lacking the quantum-coherent structures that, on the Map's view, enable consciousness to interface with matter. This would explain sophisticated cognition without phenomenal experience.

## The Baseline Cognition Framework

The [baseline-cognition](/concepts/baseline-cognition/) concept—what cognition achieves without substantial conscious contribution—provides a useful framework for interpreting simple organism behaviour. Great apes demonstrate sophisticated cognitive capacities that appear to operate without the metarepresentational consciousness that distinguishes human cognition: tool use, social reasoning, procedural metacognition, cultural traditions—all within what Tomasello calls the "zone of latent solutions."

Applied to simple organisms:

| Organism | Cognition Present? | Consciousness Indicators |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| *C. elegans* | Habituation, sensitisation, associative learning | Anaesthetic response, positive Phi, but fails trace conditioning |
| Hydra | Habituation, sensitisation, prey detection | No associative learning; distributed processing |
| Slime molds | Maze-solving, network optimisation, habituation | No neurons at all; purely biochemical? |

If baseline cognition marks what neural systems achieve without consciousness, and great apes represent that boundary, simple organisms help define the lower limit of cognition itself. The gradient from slime mold to nematode to great ape to human may track not just complexity but qualitatively different cognitive regimes—and possibly qualitatively different relationships to consciousness. The [consciousness threshold](/topics/consciousness-threshold-in-cognitive-evolution/) article examines the upper end of this gradient, where consciousness crosses a threshold and transforms what brains can do—enabling logical reasoning, cumulative culture, and counterfactual thinking that even sophisticated great ape cognition cannot achieve.

## The Three-Level Metarepresentational Framework

The [metarepresentation literature](/concepts/metacognition/) distinguishes three nested levels of representation:

1. **First-order representation**: Representing the world (e.g., knowing there's food nearby)
2. **Second-order representation**: Representing your first-order representations (e.g., uncertainty monitoring, strategic information-seeking)
3. **Metarepresentation proper**: Representing your representations *as* representations—knowing that your belief is a belief, that your knowledge could be wrong

This distinction matters for minimal consciousness because organisms can exhibit second-order states without metarepresentation. *C. elegans* shows habituation and sensitisation—arguably second-order adjustments to its own states. But it shows no evidence of representing those adjustments *as* adjustments, as the kind of thing that could be examined or modified.

The framework suggests minimal consciousness might suffice for second-order processing while full metarepresentation requires something more—the phenomenal "standing back" that allows representations to become objects of awareness. An organism might cross into genuine phenomenal experience while remaining unable to represent that experience as experience.

This has ethical implications. If *C. elegans* has minimal consciousness—even without metarepresentation—it matters morally. The worm cannot know it suffers (that would require metarepresentation), but it might suffer nonetheless. The three-level framework clarifies what's at stake: moral consideration depends on consciousness, not on metarepresentation.

## The Unlimited Associative Learning Framework

Simona Ginsburg and Eva Jablonka propose that consciousness emerged when learning became *unlimited*—capable of associating arbitrary stimuli across modalities with arbitrary actions. Their Unlimited Associative Learning (UAL) framework identifies the joint capacities required:

- Global broadcasting of information
- Selective attention
- An evaluative (valence) system
- Agency and self-other distinction
- Unlimited associative capacity across modalities

On this view, UAL marks where consciousness *interfaces* with biological systems. The framework places the transition in the Cambrian explosion (~540 million years ago) for vertebrates and arthropods. Crucially, *C. elegans*, Hydra, and slime molds all fail UAL criteria—they cannot perform trace conditioning or demonstrate unlimited associative learning.

For the Map, UAL is valuable not as a consciousness-emergence criterion but as an interface-identification tool. It tells us where consciousness reliably *couples with* physical systems, not where it *emerges from* them. The hard problem remains untouched: UAL cannot explain why meeting these functional criteria produces felt experience.

## The Distribution Problem

Why do some organisms have consciousness and others not? This is the *distribution problem*—and it presses differently on different views:

**Gradualism** proposes that consciousness increases continuously with neural complexity. But this faces the hard problem at every scale: why does *any* level of complexity produce experience?

**Threshold emergence** (as in IIT or Global Workspace Theory) holds that consciousness appears suddenly when organisational criteria are met. But this creates an arbitrary boundary problem: why should consciousness appear at precisely this threshold and not another?

**Panpsychist continuity** dissolves the distribution problem by holding that proto-consciousness is fundamental. Experience doesn't emerge; it was always present, merely organised differently. But this faces the [combination problem](/concepts/combination-problem/): how do micro-experiences combine into unified human consciousness?

**Interface dualism**—the Map's position—suggests that the distribution problem may be unanswerable because it asks the wrong question. Consciousness doesn't emerge from physical systems; it interfaces with them. Where that interface occurs depends on features of the physical system that provide the right conditions for coupling. There may be no principled threshold because consciousness isn't a property physical systems generate but a domain physical systems can connect with.

## The Illusionist Challenge

[Illusionism](/concepts/illusionism/)—the view that phenomenal consciousness is an introspective illusion—might seem to dissolve the minimal consciousness debate entirely. If there is no "what it's like" even in humans, the question of whether nematodes experience anything becomes vacuous.

**The scaling problem for illusionism.** If consciousness is an introspective illusion generated by sophisticated meta-representational machinery, the minimal consciousness literature poses a dilemma. A 302-neuron system like *C. elegans* seems an implausible candidate for generating the elaborate misrepresentations illusionism requires. Either the worm lacks the illusion entirely (raising the question of where the illusion threshold lies—the same question as for consciousness itself), or the illusion can be generated by remarkably minimal systems (raising the question of why evolution would invest in illusion-generation at such low complexity).

**The regress persists.** Raymond Tallis's objection—"misrepresentation presupposes presentation"—applies forcefully to simple organisms. For *C. elegans* to be "under the illusion" of consciousness, something in that 302-neuron system must experience the seeming-to-be-conscious. But the experiencing is precisely what illusionism denies.

**The mysterian alternative.** [Colin McGinn's cognitive closure hypothesis](/concepts/mysterianism/) suggests we may be permanently unable to understand how consciousness relates to neural activity—not because the problem is supernatural but because our conceptual apparatus lacks the resources. The *C. elegans* case exemplifies this: we possess complete structural knowledge of 302 neurons yet cannot determine whether the worm experiences anything. Complete knowledge doesn't bridge the gap. This is what cognitive closure looks like empirically.

## Contemplative Perspectives

Meditative traditions offer distinctive insights into minimal consciousness through practices that strip experience to its barest constituents.

### Minimal Phenomenal Experience

Thomas Metzinger's work on "minimal phenomenal experience" (MPE) describes states where content drains away while awareness remains—what meditators in various traditions report as "pure consciousness" or "rigpa" in Tibetan Buddhism. In these states, there is experience *of* nothing determinate, yet experience persists.

This bears on minimal consciousness: if humans can access states of awareness without objects, the question of whether simple organisms have similar "content-free" experience becomes coherent. *C. elegans* might not have rich perceptual experience but could have something like MPE—bare awareness without the cognitive elaboration that requires more sophisticated neural architecture.

### The Vijñāna/Prajñā Distinction

Buddhist analysis distinguishes *vijñāna* (basic awareness, consciousness as knowing) from *prajñā* (wisdom, discriminative understanding). The Abhidharma traditions analyse consciousness (*citta*) as momentary events accompanied by mental factors (*cetasika*). Crucially, basic vijñāna—the bare "there is awareness"—is treated as more fundamental than the elaborate cognitive processing that accompanies it.

Applied to minimal consciousness: the question for *C. elegans* is not whether it possesses sophisticated prajñā (discriminative wisdom) but whether basic vijñāna—the knowing function itself—is present. A 302-neuron system lacks complex conceptual elaboration. But it might possess the minimal "there is awareness" that constitutes consciousness at its most basic.

### Witness Consciousness

[Witness consciousness](/concepts/witness-consciousness/) practices in Advaitic and Buddhist traditions reveal that awareness can persist when specific contents—including sense of self, body ownership, temporal extension—fall away. What remains is the witnessing itself, irreducible to any content.

Applied to minimal consciousness: the question is not whether *C. elegans* has complex representational states (it probably doesn't) but whether there is witnessing occurring. The 302-neuron connectome tells us about information processing. It tells us nothing about whether that processing is witnessed.

## Process Philosophy Perspective

Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy offers an alternative framing of minimal consciousness—one that neither requires mysterious emergence nor accepts eliminativism.

For Whitehead, reality consists of "actual occasions"—momentary experiential events that constitute both subjects and objects. Each actual occasion involves "prehension" (a form of proto-experience) and "concrescence" (the process of becoming definite). Crucially, these occasions don't require sophisticated neural architecture—they occur at every level of reality.

This framework reinterprets the minimal consciousness question:

**Experience is fundamental, not emergent**: On the Whiteheadian view, experience didn't emerge from non-experience during evolution. Rather, evolution organised and amplified experiential properties that were always present at the fundamental level. The question for *C. elegans* isn't whether the worm suddenly "has" consciousness but how 302 neurons organise pre-existing experiential elements into whatever unity the worm achieves.

**Degrees of integration, not presence/absence**: Simple organisms may have simple experiential integration—what Whitehead called "low-grade actual occasions." There's no sharp threshold between conscious and non-conscious because experience admits of degrees. Hydra's distributed nerve net might produce distributed, minimal experience; *C. elegans*'s centralized processing might produce slightly more unified experience.

**The combination problem reframes**: The difficulty shifts from "how does consciousness appear from non-consciousness?" to "how do micro-occasions combine into unified experience?" This is the [combination problem](/concepts/combination-problem/)—still challenging, but perhaps more tractable than explaining consciousness from nothing.

This perspective doesn't commit the Map to full Whiteheadian metaphysics. But it shows that the minimal consciousness debate need not be framed as finding a threshold where the lights turn on. Alternative frameworks accommodate gradations of experiential complexity that may better fit the biological evidence.

## What Would Challenge This View?

The Map's perspective on minimal consciousness would be undermined if:

1. **Clear threshold identified**: If a sharp complexity boundary were found where consciousness definitively begins, emergence would become more plausible than interface.

2. **Complete neural mapping revealed consciousness mechanisms**: If mapping *C. elegans* completely eventually enabled us to determine whether it experiences anything—through some property we currently don't measure—this would challenge the claim that structural knowledge cannot bridge the explanatory gap.

3. **UAL proved necessary and sufficient for consciousness**: If the framework turned out to be both necessary (nothing below the threshold is conscious) and sufficient (everything above is conscious), the threshold would be empirically determined, supporting functionalist approaches.

4. **Illusionism explained minimal complexity illusions**: If illusionists provided a compelling account of how the illusion of consciousness could be generated by 302 neurons—or why the illusion doesn't extend to such systems—this would address the scaling challenge.

5. **Panpsychism solved the combination problem**: If panpsychists developed a compelling account of how micro-experiences combine into unified consciousness, their dissolution of the emergence question would become more attractive.

6. **Quantum effects proved irrelevant to consciousness**: If definitive experiments ruled out quantum involvement in consciousness (perhaps through quantum biology ruling out relevant coherence in neural tissue), the Map's mechanism for consciousness-matter interface would require revision.

## Relation to Site Perspective

**Dualism**: Simple organism research supports dualism by showing the hard problem is scale-independent. If we cannot explain how human neural activity produces experience, we cannot explain it for nematodes either. The explanatory gap exists at every complexity level—exactly what dualism predicts if consciousness is irreducible to physical processes.

**Minimal Quantum Interaction**: The presence of neurons (and microtubules) in all organisms from *C. elegans* upward provides substrate for quantum-level interface mechanisms. Slime mold cognition without neurons challenges this picture but may simply show that cognition and consciousness can dissociate—information processing without experience.

**Bidirectional Interaction**: The UAL framework strongly supports the view that consciousness is adaptive. If consciousness were epiphenomenal, its correlation with flexible learning would be inexplicable. The simpler explanation: consciousness causally contributes to behavioural flexibility, which is why they correlate.

**No Many Worlds**: The Many-Worlds Interpretation dissolves rather than addresses the minimal consciousness question. In MWI, every quantum event spawns branches for each possible outcome. There would be branches where *C. elegans* exhibits consciousness-indicating behaviour and branches where it doesn't, all equally real. The question "is this worm conscious?" loses determinacy because "this worm" fragments across branches.

The Map rejects MWI partly because it undermines the [haecceity](/concepts/haecceity/)—the irreducible "thisness"—that makes questions about individual consciousness coherent. If consciousness involves indexical identity (there is something it is like to be *this* particular experiencer), MWI's multiplication of observers creates an irresolvable problem: which branch's version is the "real" one?

**Occam's Razor Has Limits**: The New York Declaration embodies this tenet. Requiring certainty before moral consideration of animal consciousness would be simpler than the precautionary approach adopted. But simplicity does not determine truth. Our uncertainty about consciousness in simple organisms reflects our limitations, not reality's vagueness.
