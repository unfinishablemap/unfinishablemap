Interactionist dualism—the view that mind and body are distinct yet causally connected—has evolved through three centuries of philosophical challenge and response. Descartes established the position in the 1640s; Princess Elizabeth immediately identified its central difficulty; Leibniz seemingly closed the case with conservation arguments in the 1690s. The view entered eclipse in the twentieth century, abandoned by most philosophers as incompatible with physics. Yet quantum mechanics has reopened possibilities that Leibniz thought definitively closed. The history of this debate reveals how scientific developments can transform philosophical problems rather than simply settling them.

## The Cartesian Foundation (1640s)

René Descartes established substance dualism in his *Meditations on First Philosophy* (1641). Mind (*res cogitans*—thinking substance) and body (*res extensa*—extended substance) are fundamentally different kinds of thing. Mind thinks but has no spatial location; body occupies space but does not think.

Yet Descartes also affirmed interaction. Experience shows the mind-body relation is intimate: when the body is injured, the mind feels pain; when the mind decides to walk, the legs move. In *The Passions of the Soul* (1649), Descartes proposed that interaction occurs through the pineal gland—a small structure he believed sat at the center of the brain where it could influence the flow of "animal spirits" (fine material fluids he thought transmitted sensations and commands between brain and body).

The mechanism was wrong—the pineal gland serves no such function—but the structural claim survived the specific proposal: mind and body are distinct yet causally connected, and there must be some interface where they meet.

## Elizabeth's Challenge (1643)

Princess Elizabeth of Bohemia pressed the crucial objection in her 1643 correspondence with Descartes. Her question was precise: "how the soul of a man can determine the spirits of the body to perform voluntary actions, being but a thinking substance." How can something non-spatial push something spatial? Contact causation—one billiard ball hitting another—requires both objects to be extended. An unextended mind cannot make contact with anything.

Descartes struggled to respond. He acknowledged that the mind-body union cannot be understood through pure intellect alone, that it is something we experience rather than comprehend. This answer satisfied neither Elizabeth nor subsequent philosophers. The "interaction problem" became interactionist dualism's defining challenge.

Elizabeth's objection has two components often conflated:
1. **The conceptual problem**: How can we understand causation between fundamentally different kinds of substance?
2. **The mechanism problem**: What specific physical changes does mental causation produce?

Descartes had no satisfying answer to either. Defenders of interactionism would spend centuries developing responses.

## The Leibniz Closure (1690s)

Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz transformed the interaction problem from a conceptual puzzle into what appeared to be an empirical refutation. His argument from conservation of momentum: if the mind causes the body to move, it must add momentum to the physical world. But physics shows momentum is conserved—the total momentum of a closed system remains constant. Mental causation would violate this fundamental law.

Leibniz also offered an independent argument against materialism itself: his famous [mill argument](/topics/leibnizs-mill-argument/). Walking through an enlarged brain, we would find only mechanical parts—never perception itself. This argument targets the reducibility of consciousness to mechanism, complementing his conservation objection to interaction.

This argument seemed devastating. Unlike Elizabeth's conceptual worry, Leibniz pointed to a testable prediction: interactionism implies conservation violations that should be detectable. Since no such violations appear, interactionism is empirically refuted.

Leibniz's own solution—pre-established harmony—avoided interaction entirely. God arranged from the beginning that mental and physical events would run in parallel, like two clocks synchronized at creation. There is no causation between them; the appearance of interaction is coordinated coincidence.

The conservation argument dominated discussions for two centuries. As physics developed increasingly precise conservation laws (energy as well as momentum), the case against interactionism seemed to strengthen. By the twentieth century, most philosophers treated dualism as historically interesting but scientifically untenable.

## The Materialist Eclipse (1900s–1970s)

The twentieth century brought a convergence against dualism. Logical positivism dismissed mind-body problems as pseudo-questions arising from confused language. Behaviorism denied the reality of inner mental states. Identity theory proposed that mental states simply *are* brain states. Functionalism characterized mental states by their causal roles, implementable in principle by any suitably organized physical system.

These approaches shared a common assumption: the physical world is causally closed. Every physical event has sufficient physical causes. If mental causation exists, it must be reducible to physical causation. There is no room for immaterial minds affecting material brains.

The British emergentists—C.D. Broad and Samuel Alexander—had offered a middle path in the 1920s. They proposed that consciousness genuinely emerges from physical organization, with novel causal powers irreducible to physics. But emergence fell from favor after quantum mechanics and molecular biology seemed to reduce previously "emergent" chemical properties to fundamental physics. Consciousness, too, would eventually yield to scientific explanation—or so most assumed.

Jaegwon Kim's causal exclusion argument crystallized the problem for any view accepting non-physical mental causation:

1. Every physical event has sufficient physical causes (causal closure)
2. Mental events cause physical effects
3. Mental causes don't systematically overdetermine effects
4. Therefore mental causes must be physical causes

Dualists faced a dilemma: either mental causation is illusory ([epiphenomenalism](/arguments/epiphenomenalism/)), or causal closure is false. Neither option seemed viable. Epiphenomenalism makes consciousness a useless passenger; denying causal closure seems to conflict with physics.

## The Quantum Opening (1930s–Present)

Quantum mechanics disrupted the assumptions underlying Leibniz's objection. The theory, developed in the 1920s–1930s, describes physical systems in superposition—simultaneously in multiple states—until measurement collapses them to definite outcomes. Crucially, quantum mechanics specifies probabilities for outcomes but not which outcome occurs. Physics is fundamentally indeterministic.

John von Neumann's *Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics* (1932) gave the observer a special role. His formalism distinguished between continuous unitary evolution (the Schrödinger equation) and discontinuous collapse upon measurement. But what constitutes a "measurement"? What causes collapse? Orthodox quantum mechanics left this open—the [measurement-problem](/concepts/measurement-problem/) remains unsolved. The [structural parallel between the measurement problem and the hard problem of consciousness](/topics/consciousness-and-quantum-measurement/) suggests both problems may share the same root: both concern where first-person facts enter third-person descriptions.

Eugene Wigner explored the implications in "Remarks on the Mind-Body Question" (1961). He suggested consciousness itself might cause collapse. This was speculative, but it identified a specific locus where physics leaves room for non-physical causation. If consciousness determines which quantum outcome actualizes, mental causation operates not by injecting energy but by selecting among possibilities physics leaves undetermined.

Henry Stapp developed this insight into a detailed theory. His work from the 1990s onward proposes that mental attention acts like rapid quantum observation, holding desired neural patterns in place through the quantum Zeno effect. The [stapp-quantum-mind](/concepts/stapp-quantum-mind/) mechanism doesn't add energy to the physical world—all possible outcomes already exist in the quantum wavefunction with their associated energies. Consciousness selects which outcome becomes actual without violating conservation.

Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff proposed an alternative quantum approach: Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch OR). They locate consciousness in quantum computations within neural microtubules, with gravitational self-collapse producing moments of experience. Though different from Stapp's mechanism, Orch OR shares the key structural feature: consciousness biases otherwise undetermined quantum outcomes.

## The Conservation Objection Reconsidered

Recent philosophical work has challenged whether the conservation argument ever had the force attributed to it. J. Brian Pitts and Alin Cucu demonstrate that conservation laws are *local* and *conditional*:

**Locality**: Conservation holds "not primarily for the whole universe, but in every place separately." Energy flowing from one region enters adjacent regions. This is compatible with conservation failing at specific neural locations where minds act while holding everywhere else.

**Conditionality**: Noether's theorem derives conservation from symmetries—energy conservation from time-translation symmetry. External influences break these symmetries. If consciousness constitutes an external influence on physical systems, expecting conservation to hold in the brain simply assumes interactionism is false. The argument begs the question.

The Standard Model's completeness provides no counterargument. The Model describes how physical fields interact with each other in closed systems. It is silent about what happens when something outside the physical domain influences physical events—because it *assumes* nothing outside exists. This is appropriate methodology for physics, but it cannot settle the metaphysical question.

See [conservation-laws-and-mind](/topics/conservation-laws-and-mind/) for detailed treatment of why the conservation objection fails.

## The Contemporary Revival

Dualism's rehabilitation began with philosophical work in the 1980s–1990s:

**David Chalmers** (1996) established the [hard-problem-of-consciousness](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/)—why there is something it is like to be conscious—as distinct from "easy" problems about cognitive functions. His [zombie argument](/concepts/philosophical-zombies/) showed that physical facts don't entail phenomenal facts: a being physically identical to a conscious human but lacking experience is conceivable, suggesting consciousness is not reducible to physics. Chalmers argued for property dualism—the view that consciousness is an irreducible feature of physical systems—distinguishing this from the stronger substance dualism of Descartes.

**Richard Swinburne** (2013) defended traditional substance dualism with new arguments for personal identity: what makes me *me* is not any qualitative property but the "thisness" of my soul.

**William Hasker** (1999) developed emergent substance dualism: the soul emerges from brain function but is itself a non-physical substance with its own causal powers. This differs from Cartesian dualism in making souls spatially located and dependent on physical processes for their generation—while still being genuinely non-physical.

The 2020 PhilPapers survey found 22% of professional philosophers accept or lean toward dualism (including both property and substance dualism)—second only to physicalism at 51%. The view is no longer marginal.

## The Shape of Progress

The history of interactionist dualism follows an unexpected arc. What appeared to be progressive refutation—from Elizabeth's conceptual worry through Leibniz's conservation argument to Kim's exclusion argument—has proven to be a series of challenges that later developments addressed.

Elizabeth's problem has two solutions: either deny that contact is required for causation (many causes operate at a distance), or accept that minds have spatial location (contemporary interactionists typically locate consciousness in the brain where interaction occurs).

Leibniz's conservation objection rests on assumptions quantum mechanics undermines. Physics is not deterministic; collapse is not explained; consciousness might select among undetermined outcomes without adding energy.

Kim's exclusion argument fails if physics is not causally closed at quantum indeterminacies. Where physics specifies probabilities but not outcomes, there is no sufficient physical cause to exclude mental causation.

None of this proves interactionism true. The quantum proposals are speculative, and empirical questions about decoherence remain. But the history demonstrates something important: what counts as "impossible" depends on our physical theories, and physical theories change. The Leibniz argument that seemed to close the question for two centuries depended on assumptions that twentieth-century physics abandoned.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The Unfinishable Map's [tenets](/tenets/) embody the interactionist position as it stands after this historical development:

The **Dualism tenet** affirms what Descartes established: consciousness is not reducible to physical processes. The arguments for this—the [explanatory-gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/), the [knowledge-argument](/concepts/knowledge-argument/), the conceivability of [philosophical-zombies](/concepts/philosophical-zombies/)—have only strengthened as neuroscience advances without dissolving the hard problem.

The **Bidirectional Interaction tenet** affirms what Elizabeth questioned: consciousness causally influences the physical world. The [self-stultification argument](/arguments/epiphenomenalism/) shows that denying this leads to incoherence—we could not reliably discuss consciousness if consciousness caused nothing.

The **Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet** specifies how interaction might occur in light of what quantum mechanics revealed: by biasing otherwise indeterminate outcomes, not by injecting energy. This answers Leibniz's objection while preserving everything physics has established about conservation.

The history shows that interactionism's fortunes track developments in physics more than developments in philosophy. When physics appeared to support determinism and causal closure, interactionism seemed untenable. As physics revealed fundamental indeterminism and the measurement problem, possibilities reopened. The position is neither proven nor refuted—but it is no longer ruled out by the considerations that once seemed decisive.
