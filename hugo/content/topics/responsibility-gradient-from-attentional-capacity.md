Moral responsibility is not binary. The Unfinishable Map's [attentional economics](/concepts/attentional-economics/) framework implies that if agency scales with attentional capacity, then so does moral desert. An agent with full attentional resources—rested, undistracted, emotionally regulated, trained in deliberation—bears more responsibility for a harmful choice than one whose attentional capacity is depleted, impaired, or overwhelmed. This is not an excuse mechanism. It is a structural consequence of taking seriously the claim that consciousness influences the physical world through a bandwidth-limited channel.

The responsibility gradient framework developed here makes this implication systematic. It identifies five dimensions along which attentional capacity varies, maps them to degrees of moral desert, and addresses the objection that graded responsibility collapses into deterministic excuse-making.

## Why Attention Grounds Responsibility

Traditional accounts of [moral-responsibility](/concepts/moral-responsibility/) require three conditions: control (could have done otherwise), sourcehood (the agent originated the action), and knowledge (the agent understood what they were doing). The Map's [agent-causation](/concepts/agent-causation/) framework grounds all three in consciousness's role as selector among quantum-indeterminate neural states.

But selection operates through attention. The [attention-as-interface](/concepts/attention-as-interface/) hypothesis identifies attention as the channel through which consciousness exerts causal influence. [Control-theoretic will](/concepts/control-theoretic-will/) formalises this: consciousness is a low-bandwidth controller (~10 bits/second) that gates, stabilises, and steers neural dynamics rather than computing them. If this is correct, then the quality and scope of an agent's attentional capacity directly determines how much control, sourcehood, and knowledge they can exercise at any given moment.

An agent with impaired attentional capacity hasn't lost consciousness—they remain a subject of experience, a genuine agent. But their controller is operating with degraded bandwidth, noisy sensors, or reduced authority over the plant. The moral weight of their choices should reflect this.

## Five Dimensions of Attentional Capacity

Attentional capacity is not a single variable. The responsibility gradient operates across five dimensions, each independently affecting how much moral desert an agent bears.

### Bandwidth

[Working memory](/concepts/working-memory/) capacity (~4±1 items) determines how many considerations an agent can hold simultaneously during deliberation. Genuine moral reasoning often requires holding the action, its consequences, the affected parties, and applicable principles together in awareness. An agent with temporarily or chronically reduced working memory capacity—through fatigue, intoxication, developmental factors, or neurological damage—can entertain fewer of these simultaneously. Their deliberation is structurally impoverished, not because they don't care but because they cannot hold enough threads to reason well.

This dimension affects the *knowledge* requirement most directly. You cannot be fully responsible for consequences you lacked the bandwidth to foresee.

### Stability

The ability to sustain attention on a chosen focus—what [mental effort](/concepts/mental-effort/) phenomenology tracks—determines whether an agent can follow through on moral reasoning. An agent who recognises the right course of action but cannot hold that recognition stable against competing impulses exercises less control than one who can. [Voluntary attention](/concepts/attention-as-interface/) research distinguishes willed from automatic attentional control; the stability dimension captures how effectively the agent exercises the willed variety.

Conditions like ADHD, acute stress, sleep deprivation, and addiction all reduce attentional stability. The agent can initiate moral deliberation but cannot sustain it against distraction or impulse. Their control is intermittent rather than continuous.

### Scope

The range of the attentional field—how broadly consciousness can survey options, consequences, and affected parties—varies between agents and within the same agent across time. Narrow attentional scope produces what the [duress article](/topics/consciousness-and-moral-agency-under-duress/) calls *tunnel vision*: the agent attends to immediate demands while broader moral considerations fall outside the phenomenal field entirely.

Scope affects sourcehood. An agent whose attention is structurally confined to the immediate situation—whether by threat, addiction, or chronic poverty—did not choose to ignore distant consequences. Those consequences were never phenomenally available for selection.

### Flexibility

The capacity to shift attention between perspectives—to consider another person's viewpoint, to re-evaluate assumptions, to entertain counterfactual alternatives—underlies moral imagination. Rigid attention, locked onto one perspective or one interpretation, produces moral failures not through malice but through incapacity. The agent cannot see what they cannot attend to, and they cannot attend to what their attentional system cannot flexibly reach.

Flexibility connects to [reasons-responsiveness](/concepts/reasons-responsiveness/): an agent is responsible to the extent that they are responsive to moral reasons, and responsiveness requires the attentional flexibility to register those reasons in the first place. It also connects to [moral-perception](/concepts/moral-perception/)—the capacity to notice morally relevant features of a situation. An agent whose attention is inflexible may fail to perceive the ethical dimensions of their choices entirely.

### Availability

Not all attentional capacity is available for moral deliberation at any given moment. Chronic pain, emotional distress, poverty-related cognitive load, caregiving demands, and information overload all consume attentional resources that would otherwise be available for moral reasoning. Research on the cognitive effects of scarcity (Mullainathan and Shafir, 2013) demonstrates that poverty itself reduces available cognitive bandwidth by the equivalent of 13 IQ points—not through any permanent impairment but through the constant attentional demands of managing deprivation.

Availability is the most socially consequential dimension. It connects individual moral responsibility to structural conditions. An agent operating with depleted availability due to systemic disadvantage bears less desert for attention-demanding moral failures—not zero, but less.

## The Gradient in Practice

These five dimensions combine to produce an agent's *effective attentional capacity* for moral reasoning at any given moment. Desert scales with this effective capacity, producing a gradient rather than a binary.

| Effective Capacity | Typical Context | Desert Level |
|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Full | Rested, trained, undistracted, resourced | Full desert |
| Reduced | Fatigued, stressed, mildly impaired | Substantially responsible, with mitigation |
| Significantly impaired | Extreme emotion, intoxication, acute crisis | Diminished responsibility |
| Minimal | Severe mental illness, overwhelming trauma | Responsibility approaches (but may not reach) zero |

Two crucial features prevent this gradient from collapsing into excuse-making.

**The gradient has a floor.** As long as consciousness operates at all—as long as the agent remains a subject of experience capable of any selection whatsoever—some responsibility persists. The Map's framework entails that even severely impaired attentional capacity retains a kernel of agency. Complete absence of responsibility requires complete absence of conscious selection.

**Capacity for cultivation is itself subject to desert.** An agent who chronically neglects their attentional capacities—refusing training, choosing substances that impair attention, avoiding self-knowledge—bears *upstream responsibility* for the diminished capacity that later reduces their downstream desert. The [attentional-economics](/concepts/attentional-economics/) framework identifies attention training as metaphysically agency-enhancing. Neglecting this capacity is itself a moral matter.

## Upstream Responsibility and the Cultivation Principle

The cultivation dimension deserves extended treatment because it prevents the gradient from becoming a universal excuse. An agent who encounters a moral challenge with depleted attentional capacity may bear diminished responsibility for that specific failure—but they may bear full responsibility for the depletion itself.

Consider three cases:

**Involuntary depletion.** A surgeon who makes a judgment error after a 36-hour shift mandated by hospital policy has diminished attentional capacity through no choice of their own. Their downstream desert is reduced; their upstream responsibility is minimal. The structural conditions that produced the depletion bear moral weight.

**Negligent depletion.** A driver who causes an accident while exhausted after choosing to drive when they knew they were impaired bears upstream responsibility. Their attentional capacity at the moment of the accident was diminished, but they had full capacity when making the decision to drive. The gradient applies at the moment of the negligent choice, not the moment of the accident.

**Cultivated capacity.** An emergency physician who has trained extensively in decision-making under pressure has expanded their effective attentional capacity for crisis situations. When they perform well under conditions that would overwhelm an untrained agent, their expanded capacity reflects prior investment. Conversely, an agent who has had opportunities to train and has refused bears more responsibility for attention-demanding moral failures than one who never had access to training.

The cultivation principle means the gradient is temporally extended. Responsibility for a moment's choice may depend on choices made years earlier about developing or neglecting attentional resources.

## The Control-Theoretic Interpretation

[Control-theoretic will](/concepts/control-theoretic-will/) provides formal vocabulary for the gradient. The five dimensions map onto control-theoretic parameters:

| Dimension | Control Parameter |
|-----------|------------------|
| Bandwidth | Channel capacity |
| Stability | Loop gain / regulation authority |
| Scope | Observable state space |
| Flexibility | Switching speed between reference signals |
| Availability | Controller duty cycle (fraction of time available for moral regulation) |

When a controller operates with degraded parameters, its authority over the plant diminishes predictably. The plant's own dynamics—unconscious neural processing, habitual responses, reflexive reactions—take over to a greater degree. The agent hasn't ceased to exist as controller, but their effective control has been reduced.

This interpretation clarifies why the gradient has a floor: total loss of control would require complete disconnection of the controller from the plant, which corresponds to loss of consciousness entirely. As long as any feedback loop remains—as long as the agent experiences anything at all—some control, however minimal, persists.

## Against Binary Responsibility

The dominant alternatives to graded responsibility are both unsatisfying within the Map's framework.

**Standard compatibilism** holds that agents are responsible if they act on reasons they endorse. Sophisticated versions—notably Fischer and Ravizza's (1998) reasons-responsiveness theory—recognise that responsiveness comes in degrees, and some compatibilists already accept graded responsibility. But compatibilist accounts ground these degrees in neural function, not in the structural constraints on a conscious controller's bandwidth. The Map's framework explains *why* conditions as diverse as fatigue, poverty, and ADHD all diminish responsibility through the same mechanism: they narrow the attentional channel through which consciousness exercises genuine selection. Without this explanatory unification, compatibilist grading remains descriptive rather than mechanistic.

**Hard determinism** eliminates responsibility entirely, treating all attentional variation as just another link in the causal chain. But this denies what the Map affirms: that consciousness genuinely selects among open possibilities, and that this selection constitutes authorship. Attentional capacity modulates the scope of selection; it does not eliminate selection itself.

The gradient occupies the space between these extremes. Agents are genuine authors of their choices (against hard determinism), but the breadth and depth of their authorship varies with the attentional resources available for the authoring (against naive compatibilism).

## Objections

**"This lets everyone off the hook."** No. Full attentional capacity is the default for healthy adults in ordinary conditions. The gradient applies primarily at the margins—extreme conditions, genuine impairments, and systemic disadvantages. Most moral failures occur within the range of full or near-full capacity. The gradient adds nuance without dissolving responsibility.

**"Attentional capacity can't be measured, so the gradient is useless in practice."** Attentional capacity is better characterised than most psychological constructs. Working memory span, sustained attention tests, task-switching paradigms, and attentional blink measures all provide operationalisable proxies. The gradient doesn't require precise measurement to be morally illuminating—it requires acknowledging that capacity varies and that this variation matters.

**"This is just standard mitigation dressed in new vocabulary."** Legal systems already recognise diminished capacity, duress, and mental impairment as mitigating factors. The gradient framework goes further by identifying the *mechanism* through which these factors reduce responsibility: they all operate by constraining the attentional channel through which consciousness exercises control. This unification is not merely terminological. It predicts that any condition reducing attentional capacity—including conditions not yet recognised in legal frameworks, such as chronic cognitive load from poverty—should carry mitigating weight proportional to the degree of reduction.

## Relation to Site Perspective

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: The responsibility gradient presupposes an irreducible conscious agent whose attentional capacity is a genuine causal factor, not a neural side-effect. Without dualism, variations in attentional capacity are just variations in brain states, and the question of how much the *agent* (as distinct from their brain) can be held responsible does not arise.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)**: The gradient specifies that consciousness exercises causal power through attention, and that the scope of this power varies. Bidirectional interaction is not all-or-nothing; it operates within the bandwidth constraints of the attentional channel.

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)**: The ~10 bits/second bandwidth limit reflects the minimality of conscious influence. The gradient's dimensions describe how various conditions further constrain an already-minimal channel. Under severe attentional impairment, the minimal interaction approaches its lower bound without reaching zero.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)**: Graded responsibility requires that one outcome actually obtains. Under many-worlds, every quantum-indeterminate choice produces branches containing every possible outcome—the agent both chose well and chose poorly across the branching structure. If all outcomes are equally real, desert cannot attach to any particular branch. The gradient's moral weight depends on the reality of selection among exclusive alternatives—one choice, one outcome, one agent who must live with the consequences.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)**: A binary account of responsibility is simpler. But it fails to accommodate the structural variation in attentional capacity that empirical psychology documents. The gradient's additional complexity earns its keep by aligning moral theory with the actual conditions under which agents exercise their causal powers.
