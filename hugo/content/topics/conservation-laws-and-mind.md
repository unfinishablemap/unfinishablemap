The energy conservation objection to [interactionist-dualism](/concepts/interactionist-dualism/) claims that if non-physical consciousness could move matter, energy would be created or destroyed—violating one of physics' most fundamental principles. This objection, pressed since Leibniz in the 1690s (see [history-of-interactionist-dualism](/topics/history-of-interactionist-dualism/) for the full historical development), has been revitalized by contemporary physicists like Sean Carroll who argue the Standard Model leaves no room for "soul particles." Yet recent work by philosophers of physics demonstrates that this objection rests on misunderstandings of how conservation laws actually work. Conservation is *local* and *conditional*—it holds given certain assumptions, and fails where those assumptions fail. More importantly, consciousness may influence brain states without injecting energy at all: by selecting among quantum-permitted outcomes rather than adding anything new to the physical domain.

## The Objection Stated

The conservation argument runs as follows:

1. Energy is conserved—the total energy of a closed system remains constant
2. If non-physical consciousness could causally affect physical systems, it would have to add energy (to cause movement) or remove energy (to be affected by physical states)
3. Either way, energy conservation would be violated
4. Energy conservation is not violated
5. Therefore, non-physical consciousness cannot causally affect physical systems

Sean Carroll articulates the contemporary physics version: "The laws of physics underlying everyday life are completely understood, and there's no way within those laws to allow for the information stored in our brains to persist after we die." He demands: "What particles is that soul made of? What forces are holding it together? How does it interact with ordinary matter?" Any soul-electron interaction would require new terms in the Dirac equation—terms experiments would have detected.

This reasoning has convinced many that physics rules out dualist interaction.

## Why the Objection Fails

### Conservation Is Local, Not Cosmic

The first problem is that conservation laws are *local*, not global. As J. Brian Pitts demonstrates, energy conservation holds "not primarily for the whole universe, but in every place separately." The mathematical formulation uses local continuity equations: energy flowing out of one region flows into adjacent regions. This is quite different from a cosmic accounting where the universe's total energy remains fixed.

The implication: conservation can fail *here* while holding *everywhere else*. If consciousness acts on neurons in a particular brain, the conservation equation fails at those neural locations—but this is fully compatible with conservation holding in refrigerators, stars, and every other location where minds don't act.

### Conservation Is Conditional on Symmetries

More fundamentally, conservation is *conditional*. Noether's theorem—the mathematical foundation of conservation laws—states that conservation arises from symmetries. Energy conservation arises from time-translation symmetry: the laws of physics don't change over time. Momentum conservation arises from spatial translation symmetry. When symmetries hold, conservation follows.

The converse also holds: if conservation fails, the corresponding symmetry must be broken.

Now consider what happens if an immaterial mind acts on matter. Such action constitutes an *external influence*—something outside the physical system affecting it. External influences break the conditions under which conservation was derived. As Alin Cucu and Pitts argue: "Expecting conservation to hold in the brain (without looking) simply assumes the falsehood of Cartesianism. Hence Leibniz's objection begs the question."

The conservation objection assumes from the start that minds don't act on matter—precisely what it's supposed to prove.

### The Standard Model Covers Closed Systems

Carroll's argument that the Standard Model leaves no room for consciousness makes the same error. The Standard Model describes how physical fields interact with each other in closed systems. It says nothing about what happens when something outside the physical domain influences physical events—because it *assumes* nothing outside the physical domain exists.

This is methodologically appropriate for physics. But it cannot settle a metaphysical question about whether non-physical causes exist. As Pitts notes, the Standard Model is complete *given* no external influences. If minds constitute external influences, the Model's completeness is simply irrelevant to whether mental causation occurs.

## Selection Without Injection

The conservation objection assumes that any causal influence requires energy transfer. But quantum mechanics provides a model where causation operates differently.

### The Causal Gap at Measurement

Quantum mechanics describes systems in superposition—simultaneously in multiple states. Upon measurement, the superposition "collapses" to a single definite outcome. The Born rule gives probabilities for each outcome, but physics doesn't explain *why* one particular outcome occurs.

Standard physics leaves this unspecified—the [measurement-problem](/concepts/measurement-problem/) remains unsolved. Whether this constitutes a "causal gap" requiring a determiner, or simply irreducible indeterminacy with no further explanation possible, is itself contested. The selection framework proposes the former; instrumentalists about quantum mechanics may deny that any explanation is needed.

### Consciousness as Selector

The "selection not injection" framework proposes: consciousness selects among quantum-permitted outcomes without adding energy. All possible outcomes are already present in the wavefunction with their associated energies. When consciousness biases which outcome actualizes, it doesn't inject anything new—it determines which of the pre-existing possibilities becomes real.

Henry Stapp's [quantum Zeno mechanism](/concepts/stapp-quantum-mind/) makes this concrete. Crucially, Stapp's approach uses orthodox quantum mechanics (von Neumann-Lüders projection)—no speculative new physics is required. In quantum mechanics, repeated observation of a system can prolong its state—the Zeno effect. Stapp proposes that mental attention acts like rapid observation, holding desired neural patterns against decoherence. The mind doesn't push neurons around; it selects which neural configurations persist.

The key insight: selecting among energetically equivalent outcomes requires no energy transfer. If outcomes A, B, and C each have probability 1/3 and identical energy, then determining that A (rather than B or C) becomes actual doesn't violate conservation. All that's changed is *which* outcome occurs, not the system's total energy.

This selection operates only within neural systems integrated into the subject's control loop—consciousness biases outcomes in its own brain, not in arbitrary physical systems. The mechanism requires neural representation of alternatives, attentional observation, and developmental integration. See [brain-specialness-boundary](/topics/brain-specialness-boundary/) for why this locality follows from the mechanism itself rather than being an ad hoc restriction.

### Causation Without Energy Transfer

The selection framework requires that causation can occur without energy injection. Critics might object that all causation involves energy transfer—but this assumption is questionable.

Consider: the *direction* of an outcome can be determined by factors that contribute no energy. In chaotic systems, infinitesimal differences in initial conditions lead to vastly different outcomes. The boundary conditions of a physical system constrain which outcomes occur without adding energy. Similarly, consciousness selecting among energetically equivalent quantum outcomes could determine *which* outcome actualizes without contributing energy to *any* outcome.

The philosophical point is modest: the conservation objection assumes that causal influence requires energy transfer. This assumption is not self-evident, and the selection framework provides a model where it fails.

## What Conservation Cannot Prove

The conservation objection conflates two claims:

1. **Physical causes are sufficient**: Every physical event has a sufficient physical cause
2. **Physical causes are exclusive**: No non-physical causes exist

Conservation laws support (1) only for closed systems—systems with no external influences. They say nothing about (2). The question of whether non-physical causes exist is metaphysical, not derivable from conservation principles.

This matters because the debate over mental causation isn't really about conservation. The deep question is whether physics is *causally closed*—whether physical causes are not just sufficient but exclusive. As [causal-closure](/concepts/causal-closure/) explains, this is a philosophical thesis that cannot be established by physics alone.

Pitts concludes: "The real objection should come from empirical neuroscience, not a priori physics arguments." If someone wants to refute dualist interaction, they should look for evidence that neural systems are causally closed—not appeal to conservation laws that presuppose what they need to prove.

## Objections and Responses

### "Any Selection Mechanism Would Be Detectable"

One might argue that whatever selects among quantum outcomes must interact with electrons, and any such interaction would have been detected.

*Response*: This objection has force, and the response must be honest about its limits. If consciousness biases quantum outcomes, it operates where physics leaves outcomes undetermined—at measurement. Detection requires identifying a systematic pattern that deviates from quantum mechanical predictions. If consciousness selects among outcomes in ways that are (1) rare, (2) small in magnitude, or (3) variable across individuals and contexts, the effect might fall below experimental sensitivity.

This is not fully satisfying. A theory that predicts undetectable effects risks being unfalsifiable. The appropriate response is epistemic humility: the selection framework shows that mental causation is *compatible with* conservation laws, not that it is *proven by* them. The positive case for consciousness affecting brain states comes from philosophical arguments—the self-stultification of [epiphenomenalism](/concepts/epiphenomenalism/), the [explanatory-gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/), the cognitive differences between conscious and unconscious processing—not from physics.

### "This Is Just God-of-the-Gaps Reasoning"

Critics might see "consciousness selects at quantum indeterminacies" as inserting consciousness wherever physics is incomplete.

*Response*: The proposal isn't that consciousness explains quantum mechanics. Rather, quantum indeterminacy provides a *location* where consciousness could act without contradicting physics. The positive case for consciousness acting there comes from the philosophical arguments for dualism and against [epiphenomenalism](/concepts/epiphenomenalism/)—particularly the [self-stultification argument](/concepts/bidirectional-interaction/) that our very discussion of consciousness implies it's causally efficacious.

### "Decoherence Closes the Gap"

Doesn't [decoherence](/concepts/decoherence/) eliminate quantum effects in warm biological systems, leaving no room for quantum consciousness?

*Response*: This objection requires careful handling because it conflates two distinct claims.

First, decoherence is extremely rapid in neural tissue. Tegmark (2000) calculated decoherence times of 10⁻¹³ to 10⁻²⁰ seconds for neural microtubules—far shorter than the millisecond timescales of neural processing. If consciousness requires maintaining quantum coherence across neurons, decoherence appears to rule this out.

However, the selection framework doesn't require sustained coherence. It requires only that consciousness bias *which outcome* occurs when superposition resolves—whether through decoherence or measurement. Decoherence selects preferred bases and suppresses interference, but it doesn't determine which outcome from the resulting mixture becomes actual. That determination remains unexplained by physics.

Second, Tegmark's calculations have been challenged. Hagan et al. (2002) disputed his model parameters, yielding estimates seven orders of magnitude longer. The [tenets article](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) discusses this dispute in detail.

The deeper point: decoherence doesn't solve the [measurement-problem](/concepts/measurement-problem/). After the basis is selected and interference suppressed, the system remains in a mixture of possible outcomes. Something determines which becomes actual—and physics doesn't specify what. The role for consciousness at this juncture remains open. See [decoherence](/concepts/decoherence/) for extended treatment.

### "Many-Worlds Eliminates the Problem"

If the many-worlds interpretation (MWI) is correct, all quantum outcomes occur in different branches. There's no collapse, no selection, no causal gap for consciousness to fill.

*Response*: This is correct as far as it goes. The selection framework assumes collapse is real—that only one outcome actually occurs. If MWI is true, the framework fails.

The Map rejects MWI for independent reasons (see [No Many Worlds tenet](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)). While MWI claims parsimony by adding no new laws, it proliferates unobservable branches in compensation. More fundamentally, MWI raises indexical questions it cannot answer: why am I experiencing *this* branch rather than another? The framework provides no resources to address this, yet the question seems meaningful.

This article therefore assumes that some collapse-like process occurs. Readers who accept MWI will find the conservation objection moot—but they face their own difficulties explaining definite experience.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The Unfinishable Map's [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet holds that consciousness causally influences the physical world. The conservation objection has historically been the primary physics-based challenge to this commitment.

This article shows the objection fails:

- Conservation is local and conditional, not a cosmic law that minds must obey
- The objection begs the question by assuming no external influences exist
- Quantum mechanics provides a framework where consciousness could select outcomes without injecting energy

The [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) tenet—"the smallest possible non-physical influence on quantum outcomes"—aligns precisely with the selection-not-injection framework. Consciousness doesn't add force or energy; it biases which of the quantum-permitted outcomes becomes actual. "Minimal" applies in two dimensions: minimal energy (none injected) and minimal scope (own brain only, as the [brain-specialness-boundary](/topics/brain-specialness-boundary/) explains). The interaction is doubly constrained.

This doesn't prove consciousness acts at quantum indeterminacies. It shows that if consciousness does so act, physics provides no barrier. The positive case for interaction comes from philosophical arguments: the [explanatory-gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/), the [knowledge-argument](/concepts/knowledge-argument/), the self-stultification of epiphenomenalism, and the [empirical evidence](/concepts/baseline-cognition/) that consciousness enables cognitive functions the unconscious baseline cannot achieve.

The selection framework also has implications for [free-will](/topics/free-will/). If consciousness can select among quantum-permitted neural outcomes, this provides a mechanism for agent causation that libertarians about free will require—a locus where mind genuinely determines what happens rather than merely accompanying physical processes.
