If consciousness is ontologically distinct from physics—as The Unfinishable Map's [Dualism tenet](/tenets/#dualism) holds—then fundamental laws must connect the two domains. Physical laws describe relations among physical properties; they cannot specify how physical states relate to phenomenal experience. New laws are required. David Chalmers developed the canonical framework, arguing that consciousness requires extending fundamental ontology just as electromagnetism required new laws beyond mechanics. The Map builds on Chalmers while emphasizing a critical asymmetry: Chalmers focuses on *upward* laws (which physical states produce which experiences), while the Map's [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet requires *downward* laws (which conscious states select which physical outcomes).

This article covers the full framework: why psychophysical laws are needed, what Chalmers contributes, how the Map extends his work into downward causation, and what candidate mechanisms exist for coupling mind to matter.

## Chalmers' Framework

### The Fundamental Need

Chalmers' central argument: if consciousness is not reducible to or identical with physical processes, something must specify how the two domains relate. These psychophysical laws are "naturalistic" (lawful regularities like other natural laws—no Cartesian souls violating conservation) and "dualist" (connecting genuinely distinct domains rather than reducing one to the other). Chalmers writes in *The Conscious Mind* (1996): "A nonreductive theory of experience will add new principles to the furniture of the basic laws of nature."

### Three Bridging Principles

In "Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness" (1995), Chalmers proposes three principles constraining how phenomenal and physical properties relate.

**Structural coherence.** The structure of conscious experience corresponds to the structure of cognitive processing. Three-dimensional colour experience maps onto three-dimensional wavelength discrimination. Temporal flow parallels sequential information processing. This constrains without determining—inverted spectrum scenarios show structure alone doesn't fix phenomenal quality.

**Organizational invariance.** Any two systems with identical fine-grained functional organization have qualitatively identical experiences. Chalmers defends this through the "fading qualia" thought experiment: gradually replacing neurons with functionally identical artificial components should not cause experience to fade, since the system couldn't detect such fading (its functional states remain unchanged). Consciousness systematically deceiving itself about its own existence seems deeply implausible.

**The Map's divergence**: The Map rejects strong [functionalism](/concepts/functionalism/)—the view that mental states are exhausted by their functional roles. The zombie argument demonstrates that functional organization doesn't logically entail experience. If zombies are conceivable, something beyond functional structure determines whether a system is conscious. [Haecceity](/concepts/haecceity/)—the primitive "thisness" of a particular conscious subject—may matter beyond abstract patterns. Two systems could share all functional properties yet differ in *which* consciousness (if any) accompanies them. This isn't a minor disagreement: if organizational invariance holds, psychophysical laws can be expressed purely functionally. If the Map is right, they must reference the particular subject.

**Double-aspect information.** Chalmers' most speculative principle: information—or at least some information—has two aspects, physical and phenomenal. He explicitly treats the scope as open: does *all* information have a phenomenal aspect, or only some? If all, even thermostats might have simple experiences—approaching panpsychism through information theory. This anticipates [Integrated Information Theory](/concepts/integrated-information-theory/), though the Map is skeptical of IIT's specific measures.

### Five Constraints on Dualist Laws

Bradford Saad's "A dualist theory of experience" (2025) identifies five constraints any dualist psychophysical law must satisfy:

1. **Experiences must cause physical effects.** The minimal requirement for avoiding epiphenomenalism.
2. **No observable violations of causal closure.** Whatever consciousness does must be compatible with physics as observed.
3. **Avoid overdetermination.** Physical events shouldn't have both sufficient physical causes and sufficient mental causes.
4. **Specify how physical states yield experiences.** The upward direction must be articulated.
5. **Ensure functional duplication preserves phenomenology.** Organizational invariance again.

The Map is skeptical of constraint 5, preferring: "Ensure phenomenology supervenes on at least functional organization plus whatever additional factors (particular subject, physical substrate, etc.) turn out to matter."

## The Upward-Downward Asymmetry

Most philosophical development has focused on upward laws. Chalmers himself tends toward [epiphenomenalism](/concepts/epiphenomenalism/)—the view that consciousness accompanies physical processes without causally affecting them. His psychophysical laws are supervenience laws, not causal laws.

The Map requires more. If consciousness makes a causal difference—if intention affects action, if effort affects outcome—then upward laws alone are incomplete. We need *downward* laws: laws specifying how mental states select among physical possibilities. This is the problem of [downward-causation](/concepts/downward-causation/).

The asymmetry reflects different commitments:
- **Chalmers**: Consciousness is real and irreducible, but may be causally inert
- **The Map**: Consciousness is real, irreducible, *and* causally efficacious

Why the focus on quantum selection? Classical physics is deterministic—there's no room for consciousness to determine outcomes physics already fixes. Quantum mechanics provides probability distributions without determining specific outcomes. That gap is where [selection laws](/concepts/selection-laws/) take hold.

Selection laws must specify:
1. **Variables on the mental side**: What aspects of experience map to selection? Attention? Intention? Effort?
2. **Variables on the physical side**: What physical parameters does consciousness influence? Observation rate? Tunneling probability?
3. **Bandwidth constraints**: Research suggests ~10 bits/second—the measured bandwidth of conscious thought, implying consciousness operates at the level of policies, not individual quantum events.
4. **Scope constraints**: What is *not* selectable? External systems? Others' brains? Events outside attention?

## The Super-Resistance Principle

Chalmers and McQueen's (2022) most innovative contribution addresses a specific problem: if brains can exist in quantum superpositions, and consciousness supervenes on brain states, consciousness should sometimes be in superposition too. But we never experience superposed conscious states.

**Super-resistance** answers: consciousness resists superposition. Whenever integrated information reaches a threshold, collapse occurs, producing a definite conscious state. The more conscious a system, the less it tolerates quantum indeterminacy in its conscious states.

This constitutes downward causation: consciousness makes physical states definite by triggering collapse. Chalmers and McQueen combine IIT (specifying *which* physical configurations are conscious), Continuous Spontaneous Localization (providing collapse physics), and the super-resistance principle (coupling phenomenal properties to collapse dynamics).

**The Map's engagement**: Super-resistance is compatible with the Map's framework, providing one mechanism by which consciousness could influence physical outcomes. However, the Map prefers Stapp's attention-based mechanism over IIT-based measures: attention provides a phenomenologically grounded variable mapping directly to mental effort, whereas IIT's phi measure faces the wrong-results objection—attributing consciousness to systems that seem unconscious.

**Challenges**: The quantum Zeno problem (consciousness could get "stuck" in eigenstates); relativistic compatibility (collapse theories face tensions with special relativity); and empirical testing (distinguishing consciousness-caused collapse from decoherence-plus-hidden-variables remains difficult). Chalmers and McQueen present this as "a research program worth exploring" rather than an endorsed position, retaining sympathy for other interpretations including Many-Worlds.

## What Makes a Coupling Mechanism Adequate?

A coupling mechanism must do more than assert that consciousness affects physics. It must specify three things with enough precision that the specification could, in principle, be shown wrong:

1. **A phenomenal variable with measurable correlates.** Which aspect of experience does the coupling—attention, intention, valence?
2. **A physical parameter susceptible to non-physical influence.** Where in physics consciousness intervenes—quantum indeterminacy provides the natural candidate.
3. **A causal pathway connecting them.** How changes in the phenomenal variable produce changes in the physical parameter.

These requirements constitute the specification threshold. Below it, a proposal lacks the specificity needed for scientific engagement.

## Candidate Coupling Mechanisms

Five proposals have been advanced, varying enormously in precision and testability. (For a taxonomy of [coupling-modes](/concepts/coupling-modes/)—basis selection, timing control, probability reweighting—see the dedicated concept page.) They fall into three tiers.

### Tier 1: Stapp's Attention as Quantum Observation Rate

The most developed proposal. Henry Stapp builds on von Neumann's formulation, which distinguishes Process 1 (the observer's choice of which observable to measure), Process 2 (deterministic evolution), and Process 3 (nature's answer, governed by Born probabilities). Stapp argues consciousness operates at Process 1: it selects which question gets asked of neural quantum systems.

The quantum Zeno effect provides amplification: rapid repeated observation prevents a quantum system from evolving away from its current state. Conscious attention corresponds to high-frequency Process 1 actions—attending to a neural pattern means repeatedly "asking" whether that pattern obtains, holding it in place against competing alternatives.

**Phenomenal variable**: Intensity and focus of attention, experienced as mental effort. William James described volitional effort as "the essential phenomenon of will" (*The Principles of Psychology*, 1890). Stapp identifies this phenomenology with the rapidity of Process 1 actions: effort feels like work because it *is* work—maintaining high observation frequency.

**Physical variable**: Rate of quantum observations on neural firing patterns.

**Causal pathway**: Consciousness (phenomenal attention) → Process 1 actions → quantum Zeno effect → neural pattern stability → behaviour.

**Supporting evidence**: Jeffrey Schwartz's OCD research showed that patients using mindful attention to resist compulsions produced measurable changes in caudate nucleus activation through directed mental effort. Willed attention produces different frontal-parietal activation patterns than reflexive attention; meditation documents neural connectivity changes from sustained attention training. However, these findings are compatible with physicalist neuroplasticity accounts—no prediction from the Zeno model has yet been identified that *only* Stapp's mechanism explains.

**The decoherence objection**: Georgiev's (2015) Monte Carlo simulations showed the quantum Zeno effect breaks down for timescales exceeding brain decoherence time. If neural quantum states decohere in femtoseconds while attention operates at millisecond timescales, the Zeno mechanism cannot bridge the gap.

**Possible response**: The mechanism might operate not on sustained superpositions but at the point of outcome determination after decoherence has already selected preferred bases. Decoherence selects which outcomes are possible; consciousness biases which possible outcome becomes actual. The cost of this retreat is substantial: the original Zeno formulation made a specific, testable claim, while "consciousness selects among physically possible outcomes" is difficult to distinguish from "outcomes are stochastic." Three candidate discriminators exist: (1) *systematic bias* aligned with attentional goals beyond what noise models predict; (2) *temporal correlation* with reportable phenomenal states; (3) *intervention asymmetry* where disrupting stochastic processes doesn't eliminate selection effects. None is currently testable. A deeper concern: inserting consciousness where decoherence leaves outcomes undetermined risks relocating the explanatory gap from physics to the mind-matter interface rather than explaining collapse.

### Tier 2: Eccles' Intention as Quantum Tunneling Probability

John Eccles (1994), with quantum mechanics developed alongside Friedrich Beck, proposes coupling at neurotransmitter release sites. Each of approximately 40 million dendrons is coupled to a mental "psychon" that modulates vesicle release probability through quantum tunneling effects in synaptic exocytosis.

**Phenomenal variable**: Intention—the experience of willing.

**Physical variable**: Probability of vesicle release at individual synapses.

**The major objection**: The [pairing-problem](/concepts/pairing-problem/)—how does an immaterial psychon locate a specific dendron? Mental entities lacking spatial properties cannot stand in spatial relations to neural structures. This is Descartes' pineal gland problem multiplied across 40 million synaptic interfaces.

### Tier 3: Three Underdeveloped Candidates

**Valence as motivational force.** Pain asymbolia provides compelling evidence that phenomenal valence does causal work: patients detect tissue damage normally but lack felt badness and consequently lack avoidance motivation. The dissociation suggests felt valence, not merely damage representation, drives motivational behaviour. But no quantum-level pathway has been proposed.

**Qualia as basis selection.** Perhaps specific phenomenal qualities correspond to specific measurement bases in quantum collapse—consciousness selects *what question to ask* rather than *which answer to get*. No developed theory, no mechanism, no evidence. Conceptually interesting: it illustrates that coupling might operate at the question level rather than the outcome level.

**Unity as sustained entanglement.** Phenomenal unity might correspond to quantum entanglement rather than classical correlation, with consciousness actively sustaining coherence against decoherence. Kerskens and Pérez (2022) reported possible entanglement signatures correlating with conscious state—preliminary, unreplicated, and methodologically questioned. Correlation, even if confirmed, would not establish that consciousness *causes* entanglement.

## The Decoherence Challenge

Any quantum approach faces the objection that warm biological systems destroy quantum coherence in femtoseconds—far too fast for neural processes at millisecond timescales. Three considerations moderate this concern:

**Disputed timescales.** Tegmark's (2000) influential calculations remain accepted by most physicists. However, Hameroff's group challenged specific assumptions—arguing Tegmark modelled the wrong physical system and used unrealistic thermal parameters, obtaining coherence times several orders of magnitude longer. The debate is ongoing; categorical dismissal is premature.

**Biological quantum effects exist.** Avian magnetoreception maintains spin coherence for microseconds in warm tissue. Photosynthesis exploits quantum coherence for energy transfer. Evolution has found ways to harness quantum effects in biology.

**Decoherence doesn't solve the measurement problem.** Even after preferred bases are selected through environmental interaction, something must determine *which* outcome occurs. Physics provides probability distributions without explaining why *this* particular result actualizes. That gap remains.

The decoherence objection assumes psychophysical laws require sustained macroscopic superposition. Attention-based selection requires only that consciousness affect which questions get asked and how often—not that it maintain long-lived coherence.

## The Specification Problem

A persistent challenge: what Schaffer calls the "t-shirt problem"—the lack of any compact systematisation of psychophysical correlations. Unlike F=ma, no elegant formula captures how mind and matter relate.

Three responses:

**Scientific immaturity.** Physics took centuries to achieve its current systematization. Consciousness science is young. The absence of simple laws now doesn't imply their absence in principle.

**Cognitive closure.** Perhaps psychophysical laws involve concepts our minds aren't built to grasp—not because the laws don't exist, but because our evolutionary history didn't require comprehending them. This [mysterian](/concepts/mysterianism/) response shifts the problem from metaphysics to epistemology.

**Piecemeal progress.** The framework may never achieve physics-like elegance while still providing testable constraints. Stapp's and Eccles' proposals offer specific predictions even without grand unification.

What's not acceptable: using specification difficulty as license for unfalsifiable speculation. Developed proposals like Stapp's generate predictions that are testable in principle—the framework is not inherently unfalsifiable. But honesty requires acknowledging that no discriminating test currently exists (see the three candidate discriminators in Stapp's section). The gap between "testable in principle" and "currently testable" is real.

## The Convergence Problem

Even if each candidate mechanism operates independently, a complete coupling law must explain how they relate. Consciousness doesn't deploy attention, intention, valence, and qualitative character through separate channels. Willing an action while attending to it while experiencing its felt quality is unified. Any adequate coupling law must address how multiple phenomenal dimensions couple to physical selection through a single conscious act.

This connects to [phenomenal-unity](/concepts/phenomenal-unity/): the unity of experience may not be decomposable into separate coupling channels. The five-candidate analysis may be a useful research decomposition that doesn't correspond to how coupling actually works. A single principle operating across all phenomenal dimensions—with the five candidates as different projections—would move toward the t-shirt problem's solution. But this remains speculative.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The psychophysical laws framework is where the Map's [tenets](/tenets/) become theoretically precise.

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)** requires psychophysical laws by definition. If consciousness is ontologically distinct from physics, something must specify how they relate. Where Chalmers provides philosophical foundation, the Map develops operational specification—particularly the downward direction Chalmers leaves open.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)** requires downward selection laws, not merely upward supervenience. Stapp's attention-observation model currently best satisfies the specification threshold. However, the decoherence objection forces a difficult choice: the original Zeno version is specific and testable but may be physically impossible at neural timescales, while the post-decoherence fallback is physically more plausible but lacks discriminating predictions. The tenet's empirical credibility depends on whether future work can restore mechanistic specificity.

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)** is reflected in all candidate mechanisms. Each proposes *biasing* quantum outcomes rather than overriding physical law. Stapp modulates observation frequency; Eccles modulates tunneling probability; none injects energy or violates conservation. The ~10 bits/second bandwidth constraint further enforces minimality.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)** makes selection mechanisms meaningful. If all quantum outcomes actualize in parallel branches, coupling mechanisms have nothing to couple *to*. The mechanisms assume genuine collapse: consciousness selects one outcome while alternatives are precluded. Chalmers and McQueen's super-resistance principle also assumes collapse is real—consciousness resisting superposition makes sense only if superpositions genuinely collapse rather than branching. However, Chalmers and McQueen retain sympathy for Many-Worlds; the Map commits to genuine collapse.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)** justifies the ontological expansion. Adding fundamental laws seems less parsimonious than physicalism. But parsimony cannot adjudicate between frameworks with different explananda—the question is whether consciousness exists and is irreducible, not which view requires fewer laws. The t-shirt problem may reflect scientific immaturity rather than metaphysical impossibility.

## What Would Challenge This View?

The framework would face serious difficulty if:

1. **The hard problem dissolves.** A fully satisfying explanation of why we *believe* we have phenomenal experiences without invoking phenomenal properties would eliminate the motivation for psychophysical laws. Current illusionist proposals face the regress problem, but a proposal that genuinely avoided it would challenge the framework.

2. **Quantum mechanisms prove unavailable.** If decoherence in neural tissue is so rapid and complete that no quantum indeterminacy survives at any relevant scale—and no protective mechanism proves viable—the Map's account of downward causation loses its physical basis.

3. **Many-worlds is confirmed.** If MWI were empirically vindicated and the Born rule derived without collapse, selection laws would lose their target. All outcomes would occur; "selection" would be mere indexical uncertainty.

4. **Specification remains impossible.** If after decades no psychophysical law can be formulated with enough precision to generate testable predictions, the framework risks unfalsifiability.

5. **Phenomenology contradicts the mechanism.** If careful phenomenological investigation reveals that mental effort, attention, and intention have structures incompatible with proposed quantum coupling—for instance, if attention operates continuously rather than in discrete "observations"—specific mechanisms would need revision.

6. **Functionalism solved the hard problem.** A compelling account showing *why* functional organization produces experience—not just asserting it—would restore organizational invariance and undermine the Map's divergence from Chalmers.
