Integrated Information Theory (IIT) is the most mathematically sophisticated theory of consciousness available. It starts from phenomenology, takes experience seriously, and provides a quantitative measure (phi) for consciousness. Yet from The Unfinishable Map's perspective, IIT makes a fundamental error: it renders consciousness causally inert. By identifying consciousness *with* integrated information rather than treating it as something that *acts on* physical systems, IIT creates a theory where your choices—despite feeling like genuine selections—are determined entirely by physics. This article presents three central objections.

## The Passivity Problem

IIT's central claim is an identity thesis: consciousness *is* integrated information. The phi-structure doesn't cause neural events; it constitutes them. This sounds elegant—no mysterious interaction between separate substances. But consider the implications.

If consciousness is identical to certain physical arrangements, then consciousness doesn't *do* anything over and above what physics does. The integrated information just *is* the conscious experience; it doesn't additionally influence subsequent states. Your feeling of choosing is real—it's part of the phi-structure—but the choice itself is determined by the same causal chains that would operate in any purely physical system.

This is [epiphenomenalism](/concepts/epiphenomenalism/) by another name. Classical epiphenomenalism says consciousness is caused by but doesn't cause physical events. IIT says consciousness *is* certain physical events. Either way, consciousness doesn't influence what happens next except through its physical constitution—which means physics alone does all the causal work.

### Does Quantum Selection Escape This Charge?

Intellectual honesty requires acknowledging that critics level the same objection against the Map's quantum selection framework. If consciousness operates only at quantum indeterminacies—selecting among outcomes that physics makes equally probable—then what does consciousness *add*? The statistical distribution of outcomes remains unchanged; Born rule predictions hold. In what sense is consciousness doing anything that physics plus quantum chance wouldn't accomplish?

The answer lies in distinguishing **type-level** from **token-level** causation.

At the **type level**, consciousness doesn't change statistical regularities. If you ran my life a thousand times, the statistical distribution of outcomes would match Born rule predictions. No experiment measuring frequencies could detect consciousness's influence. In this sense, the critic is right: consciousness doesn't alter the physics.

At the **token level**, consciousness determines *which particular outcome* actualises in *this* specific instance. The Born rule says the electron has 50% probability of spin-up and 50% spin-down—but something determines which one *actually happens* in this measurement, now, to me. On the Map's view, that's consciousness selecting. On the physics-alone view, it's... what? "Objective chance"? "Brute randomness"? These are labels, not explanations.

Why does token-level determination matter? Because token-level causation is *genuine* causation. The specific pattern of quantum outcomes determines the course of my life, shapes the connections in my brain, produces the particular thoughts I'm having right now. If consciousness is what resolves quantum indeterminacies in my nervous system—even without altering their statistical distribution—then consciousness is genuinely shaping my future. The fact that someone measuring outcome frequencies wouldn't detect this influence doesn't make it causally inert; it makes the causation experimentally invisible at the type level while remaining metaphysically real at the token level.

IIT cannot make this move. If consciousness just *is* the integrated information structure, there's no room for consciousness to determine anything—not at the type level, not at the token level. The structure is what it is; it doesn't select among alternatives because there are no alternatives for it to select among. That's the difference: the Map's quantum selection faces epistemological challenges (how would we detect token-level causation?), while IIT faces a metaphysical limitation (there's nothing for consciousness to causally do).

The Map's [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet exists precisely because epiphenomenalism is self-undermining. If consciousness cannot influence neurons, then our discussions *about* consciousness are caused entirely by physical processes with no input from consciousness itself—the [causal closure of physics](/concepts/causal-closure/) doing all the work. Why should these discussions be accurate? IIT inherits this problem. Our beliefs about integrated information are themselves just more integrated information—physically constituted states caused by prior physical states. The theory cannot explain why we reliably track phenomenal facts if phenomenal facts have no causal role.

IIT might respond that since consciousness *is* the physical structure, the beliefs are automatically about themselves—self-representing states. But this trades explanation for assertion. We wanted to understand the connection between physical processes and experience—what Levine called the [explanatory-gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/). Claiming they're identical doesn't illuminate the connection; it denies there's anything to illuminate. Other identities (water = H2O) satisfy explanatorily because we can see *why* water has its properties given molecular structure. The consciousness-integration identity offers no such transparency: we cannot see why integrated information should feel like anything.

## The Expander Graph Problem

Computer scientist Scott Aaronson identified a stark implication of IIT's mathematics: certain abstract structures called expander graphs would have extraordinarily high phi. A sufficiently large expander graph would be "unboundedly more conscious than humans."

Tononi accepts this. If you built a large expander graph, it would be conscious. This commitment reveals something important about IIT: the theory follows its formalism wherever it leads, even to conclusions most find absurd.

The Map does not object to counterintuitive conclusions per se. The [Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits) tenet acknowledges that truth sometimes violates common sense. But the expander graph case exposes a deeper issue: IIT identifies consciousness with a mathematical property (integrated information) without explaining *why* this property should be conscious.

The axioms claim to derive physical requirements from phenomenological facts. But nothing in "experience is unified" entails that *any* unified structure has experience. The move from "my experience is integrated" to "integration constitutes experience" is a leap. Perhaps my experience is integrated because consciousness integrates it—not because integration *is* consciousness.

An alternative view: integrated information is a *necessary condition* for consciousness (at least in physical systems) but not identical to it. This would explain why brains with high integration are conscious without committing us to conscious expander graphs. But this alternative requires something IIT explicitly rejects—consciousness as something over and above the physical structure.

## The Temporal Gap

IIT calculates phi for systems at an instant—a snapshot of the state at time *t*. But consciousness doesn't exist at instants. You hear a melody as an extended whole, not as disconnected tones. The [specious present](/concepts/temporal-consciousness/) spans roughly 1-3 seconds. How does instantaneous phi generate experienced duration?

IIT 4.0 acknowledges temporal structure but doesn't solve the problem. The theory remains fundamentally static: each moment has its phi, each moment has its experience, but what binds moments *together* into the flowing stream of consciousness? Standard IIT has no answer.

This isn't merely a technical gap to be filled later. It reflects IIT's deeper limitation. By identifying consciousness with structure rather than process, IIT cannot capture what makes consciousness temporal. A structure exists at a time; consciousness extends *through* time. The phenomenology of duration—what Husserl called retention and protention, the felt presence of the just-past and impending future—has no home in IIT's framework.

The Map's quantum approach handles this differently. If consciousness involves collapse processes, each collapse has duration. If [retrocausality](/concepts/retrocausality/) operates, past and future constrain the present in ways that generate genuine temporal extension. This may be speculative, but it addresses what IIT ignores: consciousness as temporal, not merely instantaneous.

## What IIT Gets Right

These objections shouldn't obscure IIT's genuine contributions:

**Taking phenomenology seriously.** IIT begins with what experience is like—unified, specific, definite—and asks what physical systems could support such experience. This is the right methodological direction, moving from the undeniable (experience) to the theoretical (physical mechanisms).

**Rejecting [functionalism](/concepts/functionalism/).** IIT holds that substrate matters. Two systems performing identical functions might have different consciousness depending on architecture. This aligns with the Map's view that consciousness isn't computation.

**Embracing counterintuitive implications.** Rather than retreating from [panpsychism](/concepts/panpsychism/), Tononi accepts it. This intellectual honesty is admirable even if the conclusion is wrong. Theories that bend to intuition at every point often lack the courage to follow their logic.

**Empirical engagement.** The Templeton adversarial collaboration and COGITATE study represent serious attempts to test IIT empirically. The results have been mixed, but the willingness to submit to empirical adjudication distinguishes IIT from theories that remain safely unfalsifiable.

## A Better Alternative

The Map proposes that consciousness is genuinely distinct from physical structure and genuinely causally efficacious. The [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) tenet locates the interface at quantum indeterminacy—where physics leaves outcomes undetermined, consciousness selects. This preserves what IIT gets right (taking consciousness as fundamental) while avoiding what it gets wrong (making consciousness passive).

On this view, integrated information might be *necessary* for consciousness in physical systems—perhaps only integrated systems provide the right interface for consciousness to influence outcomes. But integration isn't *identical* to consciousness. Consciousness acts *through* integrated structures without being reducible to them. For how this might work in practice, see [the neural selection mechanism](/concepts/consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns/): consciousness biases which quantum possibilities become actual neural firing patterns.

This approach handles the expander graph problem: a highly integrated structure might be necessary for rich consciousness, but integration alone isn't sufficient. It handles the passivity problem: consciousness genuinely influences physical outcomes at quantum selection points. And it handles the temporal problem: if consciousness operates through temporally extended collapse processes, experienced duration has a natural home.

## Relation to Site Perspective

IIT represents the strongest version of a view the Map ultimately rejects: that consciousness can be captured by identifying it with physical properties. The Map's five tenets commit to consciousness as irreducible ([Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)) and causally efficacious ([Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)). IIT preserves irreducibility in a sense—phi is fundamental, not derived—but sacrifices efficacy. Consciousness becomes a property of certain arrangements, not an agent that shapes outcomes.

The choice between these frameworks depends on whether you find identity or causation more plausible as the mind-matter relation:

- **Identity** (IIT): No interaction problem, but consciousness is passive and temporal extension is unexplained.
- **Interaction** (the Map): Consciousness is active and temporally extended, but requires specifying the interaction mechanism.

The Map chooses interaction because epiphenomenalism—even the sophisticated version IIT offers—makes our discussions of consciousness accidentally accurate at best. If you trust your own introspective reports enough to theorise about consciousness, you should trust that consciousness has some role in producing those reports.
