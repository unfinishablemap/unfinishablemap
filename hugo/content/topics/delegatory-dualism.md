Delegatory dualism is Bradford Saad's 2025 solution to the causal exclusion problem—the challenge of how consciousness can cause physical effects without overdetermining outcomes that already have sufficient physical causes. The core insight: physical brain states *delegate* their causal responsibilities to conscious experiences that share their causal profiles. When you wince from pain, the pain causes the wince by taking over causal work the physical state would otherwise perform. No overdetermination occurs because the physical state's contribution is preempted, not duplicated.

This article first presents Saad's theory on its own terms, then explores how the Map integrates it with our quantum interactionist framework.

# Part I: Saad's Theory

## The Problem Saad Addresses

[Interactionist dualism](/concepts/interactionist-dualism/) faces a coordination challenge. If every physical event has a sufficient physical cause ([causal closure](/concepts/causal-closure/)), and conscious experiences also cause physical effects ([mental-causation](/concepts/mental-causation/)), then physical effects seem overdetermined—they have two sufficient causes where one would do. Kim's exclusion argument concludes that mental properties must be either physical (reduction) or inert ([epiphenomenalism](/arguments/epiphenomenalism/)).

Previous responses accepted one horn or the other:
- **Epiphenomenalists** accept that experiences don't cause physical effects—they're merely along for the ride
- **Overdeterminists** accept systematic overdetermination as the price of mental causation

Saad rejects both. Epiphenomenalism is self-undermining (if consciousness causes nothing, we have no reason to trust our reports about consciousness). Overdetermination posits redundant causation without explaining why. Delegatory dualism offers a third option: experiences genuinely cause physical effects by *taking over* causal work, not duplicating it.

## Saad's Five Constraints

Saad argues any adequate dualist theory must satisfy five constraints:

### 1. Efficacy

Experiences must cause physical effects. Pain causes wincing; visual experience causes reaching. This constraint rules out epiphenomenalism directly.

### 2. Non-Overdetermination

Physical effects caused by experience should not *also* have concurrent sufficient physical causes. One cause should be doing the work. Systematic overdetermination is theoretically unsatisfying—if physical causes suffice, why are mental causes there?

### 3. Observational Closure

Experiences should not cause *observable* violations of physical causal patterns. This is weaker than strict causal closure. Saad's key distinction: dualists need not accept that physics is complete everywhere—only that mental causation doesn't produce empirically detectable anomalies in laboratory experiments. The [observational-closure](/observational-closure/) concept page develops this distinction in depth.

> **Observational Closure**: "There are no observable violations of Closure." (Saad 2025)

Saad defines an observable violation as "a violation of Closure that would be recognized as such by an experiment of the sort performed in physics or neuroscience that lies within the realm of nomic possibility."

### 4. Upward Systematicity

Fundamental psychophysical laws must determine which experiences accompany which physical states. The mind-body correlation cannot be arbitrary—there must be principled laws connecting physical organization to phenomenal character. This is Chalmers' "supervenience laws" applied as a constraint.

### 5. Organizational Invariance

Duplicating a system's functional organization should preserve its phenomenology. Functional duplicates should have the same experiences. This constraint favors views where physical structure determines what experiences arise (though not whether experiences are identical with physical states).

Saad observes that existing dualist theories satisfy only some constraints. Epiphenomenalism satisfies all but Efficacy. Overdeterminism satisfies Efficacy but fails Non-Overdetermination. No previous theory satisfies all five.

## Saad's Two Laws

Delegatory dualism works through two laws:

### The Subset Law*

A psychophysical law assigns experiences to physical states based on *causal profile matching*:

> **Subset Law***: "If the causal profile of an experiential property E is a subset of the **default causal profile** of a physical property P, then whatever has P also has E." (Saad 2025)

The "default" qualifier is crucial. A physical state's *default* causal profile is the pattern of effects it would produce in the absence of any experience taking over—what the state would cause if delegation didn't occur. This baseline enables the delegation mechanism: experiences can preempt the default contributions without creating overdetermination, because the physical state's default role is displaced rather than duplicated.

Causal profiles are defined functionally. A physical brain state has a default causal profile: it *would* cause wincing, withdrawal, and attention-shifting. Pain has a causal profile too—it causes wincing, withdrawal, attention-shifting. When pain's profile is a subset of the physical state's default profile, pain is instantiated and takes over those causal responsibilities.

### The Delegatory Law

Here's the key move: when an experience is instantiated via profile-matching, the experience *preempts* the physical state's causal contributions. The physical state "delegates" its causal responsibilities to the experience:

> **Delegatory Law**: "Whenever a subject instantiates an experiential property E and a physical property P such that E's causal profile is a subset of P's default causal profile, E's causal profile preempts the corresponding subset of P's default causal profile." (Saad 2025)

Saad's analogy: A major and a sergeant both order troops to advance. The major's order preempts the sergeant's—the troops advance because the major commanded, not because of two commands overdetermining the same outcome. The sergeant's order is rendered causally idle, not duplicated.

Similarly: when you experience pain, your brain state delegates its "cause wincing" responsibility to the pain itself. Pain causes the wince. The physical state could have caused it but didn't—its causal role was taken over by the experience it enabled.

## Why Delegation Avoids Overdetermination

Standard overdetermination posits two independent sufficient causes producing the same effect. Both contribute; both are necessary in that removing either would prevent the outcome.

Delegation is different. The physical state is not a *concurrent* cause—it's a *preempted* cause. The physical state has the *capacity* to cause the effect but doesn't exercise it because the experience takes over. One cause operates; the other is sidelined.

This is analogous to how we understand preemption in ordinary causation. If assassin A shoots the target a moment before assassin B's bullet arrives, A causes the death even though B's bullet would have sufficed. B's shot is preempted, not overdetermining. Similarly, physical states are preempted by experiences, not overdetermined alongside them.

## Observational Closure Without Universal Closure

A crucial contribution is Saad's distinction between *universal* causal closure and *[observational](/observational-closure/) closure*:

**Universal closure**: Every physical event has a sufficient physical cause. No exceptions.

**Observational closure**: There are no *observable* violations of closure—no violations detectable by physics or neuroscience experiments.

Saad argues dualists need only respect observational closure. The delegation mechanism produces no statistical anomalies: experiences cause exactly what the physical states would have caused if delegation hadn't occurred. Causal patterns remain empirically intact. Experiments reveal nothing unusual.

This matters because the main argument against interactionism appeals to closure. If dualists can accept observational closure while rejecting universal closure, the argument loses force. Physics need not be complete *everywhere*—it need only appear complete in laboratories. Consciousness can operate causally without leaving detectable traces.

## What Saad Claims Delegation Explains

### Why We Report Our Experiences

Epiphenomenalism struggles to explain why we talk about consciousness. If consciousness causes nothing, our discussions of qualia must be caused entirely by physical states with no causal connection to the experiences themselves. Our reports would be accidentally correlated with, not caused by, what we're reporting.

Delegatory dualism avoids this. Pain causes you to say "I'm in pain" by exercising delegated causal powers. Your verbal report is genuinely caused by your experience. Introspective reports are reliable because they're caused by what they purport to describe.

### Why Phenomenal Character Tracks Function

Experiences correlate with functional roles: pain accompanies damage and motivates withdrawal; pleasure accompanies benefit and motivates approach. Epiphenomenalism makes this correlation mysterious—why would causally inert experiences track what matters?

Delegatory dualism explains the correlation: experiences are assigned to physical states via causal profile matching (Subset Law*). Experiences with certain causal profiles arise when physical states with those profiles exist. The correlation isn't coincidental—it's built into the psychophysical laws.

### Why Neuroscience Finds Correlates

Neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs) are tight correlations between brain states and experiences. Materialists cite NCCs as evidence that consciousness is neural activity. Dualists agree correlations exist but deny identity.

Delegatory dualism predicts exactly this: psychophysical laws (Subset Law*) ensure systematic correlations between physical organization and phenomenology. NCC research discovers these correlations. Nothing about NCCs favors materialism; delegatory dualism predicts the same findings.

### Testability and Limitations

Delegatory dualism is designed to satisfy Observational Closure—no observable violations of physical causal patterns. This means the theory deliberately avoids producing lab-detectable anomalies. Saad acknowledges this creates limited discriminability: the view is "in the same predictive boat" as epiphenomenalist dualism, overdeterminist dualism, and physicalism when it comes to empirical tests.

The theory *would* be falsified by an observed violation of Closure—if an experiment detected a genuine anomaly where physical effects lacked sufficient physical causes. But Observational Closure is precisely the constraint that ensures such violations don't occur at observable scales.

The theory's advantages are primarily *theoretical* rather than predictive: it explains why introspective reports track experiences (unlike epiphenomenalism) and avoids positing systematic redundant causation (unlike overdeterminism). The merits are in internal coherence and explanatory power, not distinctive empirical predictions.

## Objections and Responses

### Objection: What determines which causal profile an experience has?

If experiences have causal profiles that match physical profiles, what determines the experience's profile in the first place?

**Response**: The psychophysical laws are fundamental. Just as physics doesn't explain *why* electrons have their charge, psychophysical laws don't explain *why* pain has its causal profile. The laws specify the correlations; metaphysics need not explain them further. Delegation requires systematicity (Upward Systematicity constraint), not reduction.

### Objection: Doesn't preemption still involve two causes?

Preemption involves backup causation—both causes exist, one just operates first. Isn't this still explanatorily problematic?

**Response**: Preemption is a familiar causal structure with well-understood logic. We accept it everywhere in ordinary causation. The question isn't whether preemption involves two potential causes (it does), but whether it involves overdetermination (it doesn't). Only one cause does the actual work.

### Objection: How can non-physical experiences preempt physical states?

What metaphysical mechanism allows a non-physical cause to preempt a physical one?

**Response**: This is the general interaction problem for dualism, not specific to delegation. Delegatory dualism answers the *structure* question (how mental causation avoids overdetermination); the *mechanism* question (how non-physical causes affect physical systems) remains for any interactionist view.

### Objection: Does this framework require a specific quantum interpretation?

**Response**: Saad does not discuss Many-Worlds or commit to any particular quantum interpretation. Delegatory dualism is a framework about causal structure—how mental causation avoids overdetermination—not about the physical mechanism of mind-body interaction. Quantum mechanics is treated as one possible mechanism route, not a presupposition.

# Part II: Map Integration

*The following sections represent The Unfinishable Map's interpretation and integration of delegatory dualism with our quantum interactionist framework. These connections are not claims made by Saad.*

## Relation to Quantum Interactionism

How does delegatory dualism relate to the Map's [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) framework?

The frameworks are compatible but operate at different levels:

**Quantum interactionism** specifies *where* consciousness interfaces with physics: at quantum indeterminacies, where physics leaves outcomes undetermined. This is a claim about mechanism—the physical substrate of mental causation.

**Delegatory dualism** specifies *how* mental causation avoids overdetermination: through delegation and preemption. This is a claim about causal structure—the logic of mind-body interaction.

The frameworks could integrate: quantum indeterminacy provides the physical mechanism; delegation provides the causal structure. Consciousness biases quantum outcomes (the mechanism); this biasing constitutes the physical state delegating its causal role to the experience (the structure).

Alternatively, delegatory dualism is more general—it doesn't require quantum mechanics. The delegation framework could apply wherever mind and body interact, quantum or otherwise. For those skeptical of quantum consciousness, delegatory dualism offers an independent response to the exclusion problem.

## Observational Closure and Minimal Quantum Interaction

Saad's Observational Closure parallels the Map's approach to mental causation. Both hold that consciousness can be causally efficacious without producing empirically detectable anomalies.

The Map's [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) tenet holds that consciousness influences outcomes "without injecting energy or violating conservation laws" and rules out "any interaction that would be empirically detectable under current experimental precision." Saad's Observational Closure provides a *philosophical* justification for this empirical invisibility, independent of quantum considerations.

## The Illusionism Challenge (Map Commentary)

A challenge to delegatory dualism comes from [illusionists](/concepts/illusionism/), who argue that sophisticated self-models could generate accurate reports about consciousness without phenomenal causation—we merely *seem* to ourselves to be conscious. This trades the hard problem for an equally hard "illusion problem," since representing oneself as conscious presupposes something it is like to have that representation.

Even heterophenomenology—Dennett's method of studying consciousness through third-person observation of reports—must identify which behaviors count as "conscious reports," a categorization that implicitly relies on phenomenal concepts.

Delegatory dualism sidesteps this debate by granting experiences genuine causal efficacy. If pain *causes* you to report being in pain, there is no "illusion" to explain away.

## Many-Worlds Considerations (Map-Specific)

Saad does not discuss Many-Worlds interpretation (MWI) in his paper. However, the Map's [rejection of MWI](/tenets/#no-many-worlds) becomes relevant when integrating delegatory dualism with our quantum interactionism.

If MWI is true, every quantum outcome occurs in some branch—there is no selection among possibilities, only branching. The Map's quantum interactionism requires outcomes to be *selected* (not merely branched), so rejection of MWI is necessary for the combined view.

This is a Map-specific integration point, not a requirement of Saad's theory itself. Delegatory dualism as a framework is neutral on quantum interpretation.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Delegatory dualism supports the Map's core tenets:

**Dualism tenet**: Saad defends interactionist dualism—the view that experiences cause physical effects while being "neither identical with nor grounded in" physical states. The framework presupposes irreducibility but focuses on mental causation rather than committing to specific views about the metaphysics of mental substance.

**Bidirectional Interaction tenet**: The Efficacy constraint directly embodies bidirectional interaction. Experiences cause physical effects—pain causes wincing, beliefs cause assertions. The delegation mechanism explains *how* without overdetermination.

**Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet**: Observational Closure is compatible with minimal quantum interaction. Both hold that mental causation should not produce empirically detectable violations of physical patterns. Delegatory dualism provides theoretical justification for the claim that consciousness can be causally efficacious while respecting empirical constraints.

**Occam's Razor Has Limits tenet**: Delegatory dualism demonstrates that sophisticated dualist theories can satisfy stringent constraints. The framework is more complex than epiphenomenalism but more explanatory. Simplicity isn't everything.

**No Many-Worlds tenet**: Saad does not discuss Many-Worlds, and delegatory dualism as a framework does not depend on any particular quantum interpretation. The Map's rejection of MWI is relevant only to our quantum integration proposal, not to Saad's theory itself.

Saad's work strengthens the philosophical foundations for the Map's interactionist position. The delegation mechanism answers the exclusion/overdetermination *structure* problem—how mental causation is logically coherent. The *mechanism* question (how non-physical causes interact with physical systems) remains, and the Map addresses it via quantum interactionism.
