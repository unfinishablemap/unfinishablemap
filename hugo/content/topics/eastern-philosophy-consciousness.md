Eastern philosophical traditions—Hindu, Buddhist, and Taoist—engage consciousness with a depth and sophistication often missing from Western philosophy of mind. The Unfinishable Map finds in these traditions both allies and provocateurs: they take consciousness seriously as irreducible, rejecting the eliminativism that dismisses experience as illusion. But they also challenge Western assumptions about permanent selfhood that some forms of dualism invoke. The tension is productive: it forces clarity about what the Map's [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism) tenet actually requires.

This article examines three questions: whether Eastern *frameworks* are compatible with the Map's tenets, what Eastern *phenomenological methods* contribute as evidence, and how Buddhist no-self doctrine relates to the Map's commitment to [haecceity](/concepts/haecceity/)—the primitive thisness distinguishing *this* conscious subject from qualitatively identical others. The answers are nuanced: significant convergence on consciousness's fundamental status, productive tension on personal identity, and a resolution through process haecceitism that honours both Buddhist impermanence and indexical particularity.

## Advaita Vedānta: Non-Dual Consciousness

Advaita Vedānta, systematized by Shankara (8th century CE), holds that ultimate reality is Brahman—pure consciousness without attributes. The world of distinctions, including the apparent distinction between individual selves and Brahman, is *māyā*: not illusion in the sense of non-existence, but superimposition (*adhyāsa*) on the undifferentiated real.

The *jīva* (individual soul) is not ultimately separate from Brahman. Liberation (*moksha*) consists in recognizing this identity: "I am Brahman" (*aham brahmāsmi*). The *sakshi* (witness-self) discussed in [witness-consciousness](/concepts/witness-consciousness/) is crucial here—it is the unchanging awareness that observes all mental contents, identical with Brahman itself. Shankara argues that consciousness is self-luminous (*svayam-prakāsha*): it doesn't need to be illuminated by something else, as a lamp illuminates itself while illuminating objects.

### Alignment with the Map

**On irreducibility**: Advaita takes consciousness as fundamental—not produced by matter, but the ground of all appearance. This aligns with the Dualism tenet's core claim that consciousness cannot be reduced to physical processes.

**On the hard problem**: Advaita dissolves rather than solves the hard problem. The question "How does matter produce consciousness?" assumes matter is fundamental. If consciousness is fundamental and matter is appearance within consciousness, the question reverses. This isn't the Map's framework—the Map maintains ontological distinction between consciousness and physical processes—but it shares the rejection of materialist assumptions.

**On witness consciousness**: The *sakshi* provides the clearest bridge to the Map's position. The witness observes without being observed; it is the condition for there being objects of experience at all. This structural feature—the subject that cannot be reduced to what it witnesses—supports dualism.

### Points of Tension

**Non-duality vs. interactionism**: Advaita's ultimate position is non-dual: there is no real distinction between mind and matter because both are appearances within undifferentiated consciousness. The Map's [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) requires two genuine relata—consciousness and physical reality—for interaction to occur.

**Resolution**: Advaita distinguishes *vyāvahārika* (conventional) and *pāramārthika* (ultimate) levels of truth. At the conventional level, mind-matter distinction holds; the Map's tenets operate here. Shankara accepts that conventional distinctions are practically real even if ultimately transcended. The Map need not commit to ultimate metaphysical claims; it can operate at the conventional level where the dualism/interaction framework applies.

**Permanence**: Advaita's *ātman* (self) is eternal and unchanging—identical with Brahman. This seems to reintroduce the permanent soul that Buddhism rejects. The Map's Dualism tenet is neutral on permanence; it requires irreducibility, not eternity. But Advaita's permanent self sits more comfortably with substance dualism than the Map's agnostic stance.

## Buddhism: Impermanent Yet Irreducible

### The Five Aggregates and No-Self

Buddhism analyzes "self" into five aggregates (skandhas): form, feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness (*vijñāna*). Crucially, consciousness is *one of* these aggregates—important but not privileged. Each is impermanent, constantly arising and passing away. What we call "self" is these aggregates interacting, not a substance underlying them.

The doctrine of *anattā* (no-self) targets *ātman*—the Hindu concept of an eternal, unchanging soul. Buddhism rejects this: what continues from moment to moment is a causal process, not a substance. The flame tonight is causally connected to yesterday's flame but isn't the same flame.

This creates apparent tension with dualism. Doesn't dualism require a "self" distinct from body? Buddhism says no such permanent self exists—but this needn't conflict with irreducibility of experience at each moment.

### The Compatibility Thesis

As [buddhism-and-dualism](/concepts/buddhism-and-dualism/) argues in detail, Buddhism and the Map's dualism are compatible if we distinguish:

1. **Irreducibility**: Phenomenal properties cannot be reduced to physical properties (Map's tenet)
2. **Impermanence**: No phenomenal properties persist unchanged (Buddhist doctrine)

These are logically independent. Consciousness can be irreducible at each moment while impermanent across moments—property dualism operating within Buddhist flux. Buddhist *anattā* targets permanence, substantiality, and ownership, not the irreducibility of phenomenal properties.

### The Witness Tradition

Despite rejecting a permanent self, both Hindu and Buddhist traditions extensively discuss [witness-consciousness](/concepts/witness-consciousness/)—the *sakshi* (Sanskrit: "seer" or "observer")—the pure awareness that observes mental contents without identification. Buddhism's relationship to witness consciousness is more complex than Advaita's: while denying a permanent observer-self, Buddhist meditation cultivates precisely the capacity to observe mental contents as objects.

The resolution: Buddhism rejects an eternal soul-substance, not the phenomenal structure of awareness that makes observation possible. If consciousness can observe thoughts as objects, the observer cannot be identical to what is observed. This subject-object structure reveals something irreducible—the witness cannot become an object; it is the condition for there being objects of experience at all.

### Decentering and Self-Deconstruction

*Decentering*—the metacognitive capacity that witnessing cultivates—involves meta-awareness, disidentification, and reduced reactivity. A 7T fMRI study of advanced vipassana practitioners documented progressive self-deconstruction: self-processing regions deactivated while awareness regions activated. Equanimity correlated with mPFC deactivation and posterior cingulate activation—witnessing doesn't merely observe the self but progressively de-reifies it.

This provides empirical grounding for the Buddhist claim that rigorous observation reveals no substantial self. What investigation discloses is not an unchanging witness-substance but the *process* of witnessing—awareness operating without a fixed center. The phenomenological structure of subject-object remains; the metaphysical claim of permanence does not.

### Yogācāra and Madhyamaka

The Yogācāra ("Mind-Only") school argues that only consciousness is ultimately real. The "storehouse consciousness" (*ālaya-vijñāna*) contains the seeds of all experience, providing a mechanism for causal continuity without permanent substance. Karmic seeds are deposited and ripen, creating chains of cause and effect that persist while their substrate constantly changes. This resembles the Map's emphasis on causal efficacy: consciousness does something, intentions matter, even though what carries them forward is process rather than thing.

The Madhyamaka ("Middle Way") school, founded by Nāgārjuna, holds that all phenomena—mental and physical—are "empty" (*śūnyatā*) of inherent existence. Nothing has an independent essence; everything arises dependently. This isn't nihilism. Emptiness means "nothing exists independently"—a table exists only in relation to its parts, makers, uses, and concepts. Consciousness too exists, but not as independent substance.

Three responses preserve compatibility with the Map:
1. **Emptiness of essence, not existence**: Madhyamaka denies inherent existence, not existence altogether. Irreducibility is a relation between descriptions, not a claim about inherent existence.
2. **Two truths framework**: The Map operates at the conventional level where both frameworks function. Ultimate metaphysical status is a separate question.
3. **Asymmetric status of awareness**: Consciousness may have special status as that which recognizes emptiness—though Madhyamaka purists would resist this move.

## Buddhism and the Hard Problem

Does Buddhism face the [hard problem](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/)? Not in the same way.

The hard problem asks: why is there something it is like to be conscious? This assumes a gap between objective physical description and subjective experience. Buddhism doesn't try to bridge this gap because it doesn't start from the objective physical description. It starts from experience itself—the first-person phenomenology of suffering, perception, and mental states. The question isn't "how does matter produce consciousness?" but "what is the structure of experience and how can it be transformed?"

This doesn't mean Buddhism has *solved* the hard problem. It means Buddhism is working on different problems. But there's a lesson: the hard problem's urgency depends on assuming that the physical description is fundamental and consciousness must be explained in its terms. If you don't start from physicalism, the explanatory gap looks different.

## Taoism: Process Without Substance

Taoism offers a distinct metaphysical perspective often overlooked in Western consciousness debates. The *Tao* (Way) is the fundamental reality—ineffable, preceding distinctions, the source of all things. Crucially, the Tao is not a substance but a process: "The Tao that can be spoken is not the eternal Tao" (*Tao Te Ching* 1).

Taoism emphasizes:
- **Spontaneity** (*ziran*): Things acting according to their nature, without forced intervention
- **Non-action** (*wu wei*): Effortless action aligned with natural process
- **Complementarity** (*yin-yang*): Apparent opposites as aspects of a single dynamic

### Potential Contributions

**On the witness/selector tension**: The Map distinguishes [two modes of consciousness](/concepts/meditation-and-consciousness-modes/)—active selection and passive witnessing. Taoism's *wu wei* suggests a resolution: action without forcing, selection without striving. The highest functioning isn't pure passivity or aggressive intervention but spontaneous response aligned with nature's flow.

**On process metaphysics**: Taoism's emphasis on process over substance aligns with Whitehead's [process-philosophy](/concepts/process-philosophy/) and Buddhist momentariness. If reality is fundamentally processual, consciousness need not be a permanent substance to be irreducible.

**On naturalness**: Taoism suggests that consciousness-matter interaction might not require special mechanisms but could be a natural feature of reality. This resonates with the Map's [Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits) tenet: the apparent simplicity of eliminating consciousness may reflect ignorance rather than insight.

The Map acknowledges that Taoist contributions to consciousness studies remain largely unexplored. Key questions for future development: How does Taoist non-dualism differ from Advaita's? What does *wu wei* imply for the phenomenology of agency? Can Taoist process metaphysics inform the quantum mechanism question?

## Cross-Traditional Convergences

Despite different starting points, all three traditions converge on several claims:

**Consciousness is real and significant.** None of these traditions is eliminativist. Buddhism doesn't say consciousness is an illusion; it says the permanent self owning consciousness is an illusion. Advaita doesn't say experience is unreal; it says duality within experience is ultimately transcended. Taoism doesn't dismiss mind; it locates it within natural process. That traditions investigating consciousness for millennia through systematic practice all conclude it is real and significant supports the Dualism tenet's rejection of eliminative materialism.

**Transformation matters.** All three traditions prioritize transformation over explanation. Buddhism aims at liberation (*nirvana*); Vedānta at recognition of identity with Brahman (*moksha*); Taoism at alignment with natural process. The Map's explanatory project differs, but the traditions' convergence suggests that explanation alone may not be the ultimate goal.

**Contemplative methods access what theory cannot.** Each tradition developed sophisticated practices for investigating consciousness from within—not mere rituals but systematic methodologies refined over centuries. Cross-traditional convergence appears on the impermanence of mental contents, the capacity for witnessing awareness distinct from what it observes, and cessation states where ordinary consciousness temporarily suspends. That multiple independent traditions converge on these observations suggests they're discovering something real. However, interpreting this convergence requires caution—critics like Thompson (2020) note that apparent agreement may mask significant differences in what practitioners actually experience.

**Personal identity is problematic.** None straightforwardly endorses the Western conception of a continuous, bounded individual persisting through time. Buddhism denies permanent self; Advaita holds individual identity is ultimately illusory; Taoism dissolves rigid self-boundaries into natural process. This challenges versions of dualism requiring a persistent soul-substance—but not the Map's position, which requires irreducibility rather than permanence.

## Contemplative Evidence

### Neurophenomenology

Francisco Varela's [neurophenomenology](/concepts/neurophenomenology/) provides a methodological framework for integrating contemplative phenomenological insights with neuroscience. Long-term meditators serve as "trained observers" whose first-person reports reveal consciousness structures invisible to ordinary introspection.

**Jhana states**: 7-Tesla fMRI studies of advanced meditators show distinct neural signatures during jhana states—disrupted hierarchical brain organization, increased global connectivity, and elevated complexity measures. The eight progressively refined jhana levels provide phenomenological data that third-person methods alone cannot generate.

**Cessation experiences**: Buddhist traditions describe *nirodha samapatti*—complete cessation of perception and feeling—as an attainable state. Meditators can voluntarily suspend phenomenal consciousness while brain activity continues. This challenges the assumption that consciousness simply *is* neural activity, supporting the Map's filter theory interpretation.

**Minimal phenomenal experience**: Thomas Metzinger's research describes awareness without the usual subject-object structure—non-conceptual, atemporal, non-egoic, yet vividly present. If consciousness can operate stripped of all content, awareness is more fundamental than any particular form it takes. See [The Phenomenology of the Edge](/voids/phenomenology-of-the-edge/) for detailed treatment.

**Temporal microstructure**: Buddhist descriptions of *khanika* (momentariness)—experience arising and passing in rapid succession—align with Husserl's phenomenological analysis. Contemplative training discloses transitions that ordinary awareness blurs, demonstrating empirical methods for investigating consciousness, not just philosophical claims.

### Dream Yoga: Consciousness in Sleep

Tibetan Buddhist dream yoga (*mi-lam*) provides another empirical avenue. This millennium-old tradition trains practitioners to maintain awareness during sleep—both within dreams and through dreamless states.

Dream yoga proceeds through progressive stages: achieving lucidity, overcoming fear, controlling dream objects through intention, and ultimately recognizing the dream body's insubstantiality. The practice culminates in "sleep yoga"—maintaining awareness through dreamless sleep.

Dream yoga reveals that waking and dream experience share a common structure: both are constructions of mind. Recent lucid dreaming research validates aspects of this tradition. Demirel et al. (2025) identify lucid dreaming as a distinct consciousness state with its own neural signature. Two-way communication experiments confirm that lucid dreamers can exchange information with experimenters while verifiably in REM sleep.

For the Map's framework, dream yoga demonstrates [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) within the experiential domain: dreamers volitionally control dream contents through intention. It also supports the filter theory: dreams are what consciousness does when sensory constraints are removed.

## The Illusionist Challenge

[Illusionism](/concepts/illusionism/) poses a distinctive challenge to both Buddhism and the Map's engagement with it. If phenomenal consciousness is an introspective illusion—if there's nothing it's really like to meditate, suffer, or achieve cessation—then Buddhism's entire practical project rests on a fiction.

### The Regress Response

The illusionist faces a regress: for something to *seem* a certain way, there must be a subject to whom it seems that way. The illusion of suffering must be experienced—and that experiencing is phenomenal. Buddhism recognises this through *vijñāna*: awareness exists even if the self that supposedly owns it does not.

### The Contemplative Challenge

Trained meditators present a problem for illusionism. Fox et al. (2012) showed meditation experience predicts introspective accuracy. If phenomenal consciousness were illusion, training should eventually *dissolve* it. Instead, training *refines* phenomenal access: meditators report increasingly subtle distinctions, not recognition that there was nothing there. When trained observers across traditions converge on phenomenological descriptions—temporal microstructure, witness-content distinction, stages of insight—the parsimonious explanation is that they're describing something real.

### Buddhism's Own Response

Buddhism has sophisticated responses to illusionism avant la lettre. Yogācāra's "consciousness-only" position is sometimes mistaken for illusionism—but Yogācāra denies external objects, not experience itself. More radically, Madhyamaka emptiness (*śūnyatā*) applies to consciousness too—consciousness lacks inherent existence. But emptiness doesn't mean non-existence. The question "Is consciousness real or illusory?" dissolves into the two-truths framework: conventionally, consciousness exists and can be trained; ultimately, both consciousness and its objects are empty of independent essence.

This Buddhist response may be more subtle than either Western illusionism or Western realism. It takes consciousness seriously as a phenomenon requiring transformation while denying the substantialist metaphysics that Western dualism sometimes implies.

## The Haecceity Tension

### The Apparent Conflict

Buddhist *anattā* denies permanent selfhood. The Map's framework requires [haecceity](/concepts/haecceity/)—primitive thisness distinguishing *this* conscious subject from qualitatively identical others. The [No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds) tenet explicitly invokes indexical identity, and the [vertiginous-question](/topics/vertiginous-question/)—"Why, of all conscious beings, am *I* this one?"—demands a haecceitistic fact.

If there is no substantial self, what bears haecceity? The conflict sharpens in specific scenarios. In teleportation, the haecceitist says the reconstructed person lacks your haecceity—but if there was no substantial self to begin with, what exactly failed to transfer? In moment-to-moment persistence, if the self arises and passes each moment, how does haecceity persist through the flux?

### Process Haecceitism: The Resolution

The key insight: haecceity does not require a permanent substance. It requires particularity—that *this* is distinguishable from *that* even when qualitatively identical.

Consider electrons. Two electrons share all qualitative properties yet remain numerically distinct. Physics offers no qualitative basis for their distinctness; they're genuinely indistinguishable. Yet quantum mechanics treats them as countably separate. Whatever makes electron A different from electron B, it's not a qualitative property—it's a haecceitistic fact. Yet electrons aren't substances in any metaphysically robust sense; they're excitations of quantum fields, existing as processes rather than persistent things.

If physics already relies on haecceity for particles lacking substantial permanence, haecceity about consciousness doesn't require a permanent soul either. The resolution: haecceity applies to experiential *processes*, not substantial *selves*. *This* stream of moments is distinct from *that* stream, even without a permanent substrate underlying either.

Buddhism doesn't deny that *this* person experiences *this* moment. It denies an unchanging soul underneath. But the indexical fact—that I am this series of experiences—remains even if the referent is process rather than thing.

### The Flame Analogy Revisited

Buddhism's flame analogy actually supports process haecceitism. What makes tonight's flame the *continuation* of yesterday's rather than a numerically distinct flame? Causal continuity—tonight's flame was caused by yesterday's. Process haecceitism extends this: the causal chain constitutes *this* flame-process, distinguishable from another candle's flame-process even if the two were qualitatively identical at each moment. Applied to consciousness: *this* experiential process is distinguished from qualitatively identical alternatives by its particular causal history.

### Contemplative Support

Advanced meditators who report seeing through the self-illusion don't typically report losing all sense of particularity. They continue to experience *this* moment, *this* breath, *this* awareness—while recognizing that no substantial self underlies these experiences. If haecceity required a permanent soul, deconstructing the self should dissolve haecceity along with it. But practitioners who deconstruct the self continue to experience as particular beings. The particularity survives the dissolution of substance.

This contemplative evidence supports—though does not prove—process haecceitism. Critics might argue that the sense of being *this* meditator is itself a residual construction. But the burden shifts: those who deny process haecceity must explain why the phenomenology of particularity persists precisely when other aspects of selfhood dissolve.

### What the Map Actually Requires

The Map's haecceity commitment is minimal: indexical questions have answers. This requires that there be a fact about which conscious being I am. The commitment does *not* require permanence (haecceity can apply to changing processes), substance (haecceity can apply to streams of events), or qualitative uniqueness (haecceity distinguishes things *despite* qualitative identity).

Buddhism's deconstruction of permanent selfhood is compatible with this framework. The denial of *ātman* (eternal soul) doesn't conflict with process haecceity. The affirmation of *vijñāna* (consciousness as real, momentary, causally efficacious) aligns with the Dualism tenet. And the conventionality of personal identity doesn't eliminate haecceity—"conventional" in Buddhist philosophy doesn't mean "unreal"; it means "dependently arisen."

## Eastern Approaches to Meaning

Buddhism's approach to the [meaning of life](/topics/meaning-of-life/) offers a distinctive alternative to both Western nihilism and Western theism.

The Four Noble Truths diagnose the human condition: life involves suffering (dukkha), suffering arises from craving, suffering can cease, and the Eightfold Path leads to cessation. This isn't nihilism—it says the *craving* for cosmic meaning perpetuates suffering. Liberation comes not from finding meaning but from releasing the grip of craving.

Yet Mahayana Buddhism goes further: meaning emerges through compassionate engagement itself. The *bodhisattva* ideal—awakening not for oneself alone but for all sentient beings—transforms meaning from something sought into something enacted. This offers a third path between Western nihilism and cosmic teleology: meaning neither discovered in the universe nor merely invented by individuals, but *realised through relationship*.

Compare this with the Map's view that meaning is grounded in consciousness itself. Buddhism agrees that conscious experience is significant—and adds that this significance is fulfilled through compassionate engagement, not abstract recognition.

## Process Philosophy as Bridge

Alfred North Whitehead's [process-philosophy](/concepts/process-philosophy/) bridges Buddhist and Map perspectives. For Whitehead, reality consists of "actual occasions"—momentary experiential events that arise, prehend (grasp) their predecessors, and perish. This strikingly resembles Buddhist *khaṇika-vāda* (momentariness doctrine).

Both frameworks reject permanent substances in favour of process. Whitehead's "prehension" (how each occasion grasps its past) maps to Buddhist "saṅkhāra" (formations, conditioned arising). Both describe how present experience inherits from and transforms the past without requiring a permanent substrate.

Whitehead's "concrescence"—how an actual occasion becomes determinate—illuminates Buddhist phenomenology. Each moment integrates multiple prehensions into unified experience, then perishes. This matches vipassana practice: observing arising, persistence, and passing at fine temporal scales.

Process philosophy suggests that Buddhist insights about impermanence needn't threaten the Map's dualism. What's irreducible isn't a permanent conscious substance but the experiential aspect of each actual occasion. Moment by moment, there is something it is like—and this something is not identical to physical description.

## What Would Challenge This View?

The Map's engagement with Eastern philosophy rests on several claims that could be empirically or philosophically challenged:

1. **Contemplative phenomenology proves unreliable.** If extensive training revealed that meditators systematically disagree on basic phenomenological claims—or that their reports reflected cultural priming rather than genuine perception—the evidential status of contemplative data would collapse. Currently, cross-tradition convergence on core features supports reliability.

2. **Illusionism explains contemplative reports.** If neuroscience could fully explain why trained meditators *report* phenomenological distinctions without positing genuine phenomenal access, this would undermine the Map's use of contemplative evidence.

3. **Buddhist philosophy proves incompatible with dualism.** If careful analysis showed that Buddhist *anattā* necessarily extends to the irreducibility of phenomenal properties—requiring not just impermanence but full reduction to functional processes—the compatibility thesis would fail. The [detailed analysis](/concepts/buddhism-and-dualism/) argues otherwise.

4. **Cessation states prove to be mere unconsciousness.** If EEG or fMRI studies of practitioners in *nirodha samāpatti* showed the neural signature of ordinary unconsciousness rather than something distinctive, the claim that consciousness can persist through content-cessation would be undermined.

5. **Process haecceitism collapses.** If qualitative identity sufficed for numerical identity in processes—if there were no fact about which of two qualitatively identical experiential streams is which—anti-haecceitism would hold. Or if advanced meditators consistently reported loss of particularity along with loss of substantial selfhood, the experiential support would vanish.

6. **Process philosophy proves incompatible with physics.** If Whitehead's actual occasions require quantum effects that [decoherence](/concepts/decoherence/) definitively rules out in warm biological systems, the bridge between Buddhist and Map frameworks would collapse.

None has occurred. The engagement remains productive.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Eastern philosophy illuminates all five of the Map's [tenets](/tenets/), while raising productive challenges.

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: Eastern traditions converge on consciousness as irreducible—not producible by or eliminable to physical descriptions. Buddhism's rejection of permanent self refines rather than contradicts this: irreducibility at each moment doesn't require permanence across moments. Advaita's treatment of consciousness as fundamental and self-luminous provides additional support. Taoism's process orientation suggests irreducibility can characterize dynamic, transforming realities. The illusionist challenge gains no traction against Buddhist phenomenology precisely because Buddhism takes experience seriously enough to train it systematically.

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)**: Buddhist descriptions of temporal microstructure—*khaṇika* momentariness, the fine grain of arising and passing—reveal consciousness operating at finer timescales than ordinary awareness accesses. Whether this connects to quantum processes remains speculative; the phenomenological and quantum timescales differ dramatically. Dream yoga's demonstration that consciousness persists without sensory constraint supports the filter theory interpretation.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)**: Buddhist karma doctrine implies mental causation—intentions produce real consequences. This is bidirectional interaction: consciousness influences outcomes. Dream yoga goes further: trained dreamers exercise volitional control over dream content. Yogācāra's storehouse consciousness provides a mechanism for causal continuity—karmic seeds deposited and ripened, consciousness doing something causally efficacious without requiring permanent substance.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)**: Eastern traditions uniformly emphasize *this* life, *this* moment, *this* path. Buddhist practice focuses on what happens for *this* practitioner; Advaita's project is recognizing identity with Brahman *here*. The soteriological emphasis resonates with the rejection of many-worlds. Process haecceitism supports this: even without a permanent soul, there is a fact about which experiential process is mine. Post-measurement, one branch contains *this* process; many-worlds' ontological symmetry says both are equally real, but process haecceitism says there's still a fact about which is the continuation of *this* stream.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)**: Two millennia of contemplative investigation represent data that Western philosophy has largely ignored. Dismissing this as "merely subjective" may reflect methodological blindness rather than parsimony. Eastern metaphysics—dependent origination, emptiness, karmic causation, non-duality—is not simpler than materialism. Yet these frameworks developed from sustained investigation, not love of complexity. Their persistence suggests that the apparent simplicity of materialism may reflect ignorance rather than insight.
