The Unfinishable Map commits to two claims that jointly force an unresolved question. First, consciousness causally selects among physically underdetermined outcomes ([Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)). Second, value resides in phenomenal experience—the felt badness of suffering is intrinsic, not projected ([consciousness-value-connection](/concepts/consciousness-value-connection/)). The question these commitments force: **does the selection mechanism operate guided by valence, or is it value-blind?**

If selection is *value-blind*, consciousness steers neural outcomes through attention and intention alone, treating these as neutral pointers. Valence is real but causally idle in the selection process itself—value becomes epiphenomenal to the very mechanism the Map claims consciousness operates through. If selection is *value-sensitive*, valence directly influences which outcomes get selected. The felt goodness or badness of anticipated states shapes which quantum possibilities become actual. This makes the Map's physics locally teleological: outcomes are selected *because they matter*, not merely *by* something to which things matter.

This article states the fork explicitly, maps the consequences of each horn, and proposes how each would show up in testability hooks.

## Why the Fork Is Forced

The fork arises from the intersection of three commitments, each well-developed in the Map's existing content:

**Selection exists.** The [selection-laws](/concepts/selection-laws/) framework specifies that consciousness selects among quantum-mechanically underdetermined neural outcomes. [Control-theoretic will](/concepts/control-theoretic-will/) formalises this: consciousness is a low-bandwidth controller (~10 bits/second) that gates, stabilises, vetoes, and steers neural dynamics.

**Value is phenomenal.** The [consciousness-value-connection](/concepts/consciousness-value-connection/) holds that value requires consciousness. [Phenomenal value realism](/topics/phenomenal-value-realism/) goes further: some phenomenal properties just *are* value properties. The felt badness of pain constitutes badness; it is not a representation of badness.

**Valence is listed as a candidate mental variable.** The [selection laws article](/concepts/selection-laws/#what-selection-laws-must-specify) lists valence alongside attention, intention, and effort as candidates for the mental side of the selection law. But it also notes that valence "lacks a developed mechanism specifying how the mental variable connects to physical selection." This is precisely the gap the fork exposes.

If valence is a real phenomenal property that grounds value, and if consciousness causally selects outcomes, then either valence participates in selection or it doesn't. There is no third option within the Map's framework.

## The Value-Blind Horn

On this view, selection operates through attention and intention as *content-neutral mechanisms*. Attention directs conscious observation toward specific neural subsystems. Intention biases which action patterns reach threshold. Effort sustains the observation against competing patterns. None of these requires valence to function. The controller steers the plant, but the steering is governed by attentional targeting, not by whether the target state feels good or bad.

### What Value-Blind Selection Preserves

Value-blind selection preserves a clean separation between the *mechanism* of consciousness (how it acts on the brain) and the *content* of consciousness (what it experiences, including valence). This mirrors the distinction in control theory between the controller's actuator channel and its sensor channel. The sensor provides feedback—including valenced feedback—but the actuator operates through a separate channel that need not encode value directly.

Stapp's quantum Zeno model offers one illustration. On that proposal, attention increases the observation rate on a neural subsystem, stabilising it via the Zeno effect. The mechanism is attention intensity → observation frequency → pattern stability. Valence need play no role: you attend to what you attend to, and the physics does the rest. Whether what you attend to feels good or bad is a fact about the feedback channel, not the control signal.

### The Problem: Value Becomes Epiphenomenal to Selection

If valence is real and causally inert in selection, the Map faces an internal tension. It holds that consciousness does genuine causal work ([Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)) and that value is phenomenal ([phenomenal-value-realism](/topics/phenomenal-value-realism/)). But if the causal work is done by attention—a value-neutral pointer—while value sits in the feedback channel doing no selective work, then the *value* dimension of consciousness is along for the ride.

This is not full epiphenomenalism. Consciousness remains causally efficacious through attention. But the specifically *evaluative* dimension of consciousness—the dimension the Map claims grounds all value—becomes causally idle in the one mechanism the Map assigns to consciousness. The Map would be saying: consciousness matters because it acts, and value matters because it is felt, but value doesn't matter *in the way consciousness acts*.

The [pain asymbolia evidence](/concepts/valence/#valence-does-causal-work) complicates this further. Patients with intact sensory pain processing but absent felt badness behave differently—they don't avoid painful stimuli with normal urgency. If valence is causally inert in selection, this evidence must be explained through a different pathway (perhaps valence modulates attention intensity rather than selection directly). But that would make valence causally relevant to selection after all—pushing toward the other horn.

### Testability Hooks for Value-Blind Selection

If selection is value-blind, specific predictions follow:

- **Attentional deployment should be independent of valence under controlled conditions.** When attention is directed equally to positively and negatively valenced targets, selection efficacy should be identical. There should be no "valence bonus" in conscious selection tasks.
- **The ~10 bits/second bandwidth should apply uniformly across valenced and neutral content.** Valenced information should not receive preferential processing at the selection level (though it may at the feedback level).
- **Meditation practitioners who increase attentional control should show no change in valence-related selection biases.** Enhanced control improves the neutral pointer; it does not change what the pointer is sensitive to.
- **Neural signatures of conscious selection (frontal theta, bidirectional coherence) should correlate with attentional effort, not with the valence of the selected outcome.**

## The Value-Sensitive Horn

On this view, valence directly shapes which outcomes consciousness selects. The felt goodness or badness of anticipated states enters the selection law itself: consciousness is not merely an attentional pointer but a *valenced* selector that preferentially actualises outcomes anticipated to be experientially better.

### What Value-Sensitive Selection Implies

The consequences are substantial. If valence influences which quantum possibilities become actual, the Map's physics becomes locally teleological. Outcomes in conscious brains are selected partly *because of how they would feel*. This does not require cosmic teleology—the universe has no purpose, most events are purposeless, and evolution is blind. But within the narrow channel where consciousness acts on neural dynamics, selection would be guided by value. [Agent teleology](/concepts/agent-teleology/) would be strengthened from "conscious beings act for reasons" to "the mechanism through which they act is itself reason-responsive."

This connects to the control-theoretic framing. In [control-theoretic-will](/concepts/control-theoretic-will/), the "setpoint" is listed as "agent's intentions, values, goals." If the setpoint includes valence—if the control law compares anticipated phenomenal states and outputs a signal that favours positively valenced outcomes—then value is written into the control law itself, not merely observed in the feedback channel.

### Value-Sensitive Selection and Phenomenal Value Realism

The value-sensitive horn strengthens [phenomenal-value-realism](/topics/phenomenal-value-realism/) considerably. If valence not only constitutes value (a metaphysical claim) but also participates in selection (a causal claim), then value is doubly non-epiphenomenal: it is real as experienced *and* efficacious as selector. The consciousness-value connection becomes not just that consciousness is necessary for value to exist, but that value is necessary for consciousness to function as it does. Selection without valence would be directionless; valence provides the criterion that makes selection purposive rather than arbitrary.

### The Problem: Local Teleological Physics

Value-sensitive selection implies that outcomes in conscious brains are partially selected for their experiential quality. This is a form of teleology—explanation by what something is *for* rather than what caused it. Even constrained to conscious brains and quantum indeterminacies, this claim faces objections:

**Mechanism specification.** How does anticipated valence enter the selection law? Stapp's model offers attention-as-observation-rate. No analogous mechanism maps valence to a physical parameter. One possibility: valence modulates which neural pattern consciousness "observes" (selecting what to stabilise based on anticipated value). Another: valence determines the observation rate itself (attending more intensely to positively valued possibilities). Both remain speculative.

**The anticipation problem.** Value-sensitive selection requires consciousness to assess the valence of *anticipated* outcomes before selecting them. This implies a forward model—consciousness must predict how outcomes would feel. The brain clearly runs such models (anticipatory pleasure, dread). But if the prediction itself is a neural process, the selection-relevant valence is a prediction of phenomenal quality, not phenomenal quality itself. Does predicted valence have the same metaphysical status as experienced valence?

**Scope of teleology.** If selection is value-sensitive in conscious brains, what about marginal cases? Does a rat's pain avoidance reflect value-sensitive selection? Does an insect's? Where the Map draws the consciousness boundary, it also draws the teleology boundary—and that boundary remains unclear.

### Testability Hooks for Value-Sensitive Selection

If selection is value-sensitive, different predictions follow:

- **Valenced content should show a selection advantage.** In tasks where conscious selection among competing neural patterns is required, positively or negatively valenced options should be selected more readily (faster, more reliably) than neutral options of equal attentional salience.
- **The ~10 bits/second bandwidth should be modulated by valence.** Under extreme valence (acute pain, intense pleasure), effective bandwidth might increase—consciousness selects more efficiently when value is at stake.
- **Pain asymbolia patients should show reduced conscious selection efficacy**, not just reduced motivation. If valence participates in the selection mechanism itself, its absence should degrade the mechanism, not just the motivational response.
- **Neural signatures of conscious selection should correlate with both attentional effort and the valence of the selected outcome.** Valenced selections should recruit additional neural resources (amygdala-prefrontal coupling, affective processing networks) that are absent in value-neutral selections of equal attentional demand.
- **Contemplative practitioners who report altered valence processing (equanimity) should show different selection profiles than those who only increase attentional control.** Mindfulness vs. loving-kindness traditions train different aspects of the selection mechanism if value-sensitivity is real.

## The Map's Current Lean

The Map's existing content leans value-sensitive without having committed. The [valence](/concepts/valence/) article states: "if consciousness biases neural outcomes, valence may provide the criterion for selection. Consciousness doesn't randomly influence quantum indeterminacies—it does so guided by valenced assessment." The [agent-teleology](/concepts/agent-teleology/) article affirms that conscious beings act *for reasons*, implying value-directed action. The [control-theoretic-will](/concepts/control-theoretic-will/) article lists "values" in the controller's setpoint.

But the [selection-laws](/concepts/selection-laws/) article develops only attention and intention as mechanisms with physical implementations (Stapp, Eccles). Valence is listed as a candidate but acknowledged as undeveloped. The mechanism gap is real: leaning value-sensitive without a mechanism is an aspiration, not a position.

## A Possible Middle Path

The fork may be less stark than it appears. A graduated position is available:

**Valence modulates attention, which drives selection.** On this view, valence is neither a direct selection variable nor causally idle. Instead, valence shapes *where attention goes and how intensely it is sustained*—and attention, in turn, drives selection through whatever quantum mechanism operates. Pain captures attention; pleasure sustains it; anticipated suffering redirects it. Valence acts on selection, but indirectly, through the attentional channel.

This middle path preserves value's causal relevance (valence shapes attention, attention drives selection) without requiring a separate valence-to-physics coupling mechanism. It is compatible with Stapp's model: valence influences what gets observed, and observation frequency determines which patterns stabilise.

The cost: if valence operates only through attention, then the selection law itself remains value-blind at the fundamental level. The teleological character emerges from the combination of value-sensitive attention and value-blind selection, not from the physics of selection itself. Whether this satisfies the Map's commitment to value's non-epiphenomenality is debatable. It makes value a cause of selection (via attention) rather than a bystander, but the causal chain runs through a value-neutral mechanism.

## Relation to Site Perspective

This fork is structurally forced by the Map's own commitments, and resolving it clarifies what kind of dualism the Map endorses.

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: Both horns preserve dualism. Whether selection is value-blind or value-sensitive, consciousness remains irreducible. The question is what *aspects* of consciousness do causal work: attention alone, or attention plus valence.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)**: The value-blind horn risks a partial retreat from bidirectional interaction. If the evaluative dimension of consciousness is causally idle in selection, the interaction is narrower than the tenet suggests—consciousness acts, but not in its full character.

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)**: Value-blind selection is arguably more minimal—fewer mental variables influence physics. Value-sensitive selection adds a parameter, potentially increasing the "size" of the non-physical influence. The minimality tenet may favour the value-blind horn, though this depends on whether valence modulating attention counts as increasing the interaction.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)**: Under Many Worlds, the fork dissolves—all outcomes occur regardless. Value-sensitive selection requires single-outcome collapse to be meaningful: consciousness must actually choose the better outcome, not merely observe that it ended up in a branch where the better outcome happened.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)**: Value-sensitive selection is less parsimonious: it adds teleological structure to local physics. But if the evidence supports it—if valenced content shows genuine selection advantages—then parsimony should yield to adequacy, as this tenet insists.

The Map should eventually take a position on this fork. The graduated middle path—valence modulating attention, attention driving selection—is the most defensible current stance, but even this requires specifying how valence-attention coupling works and whether indirect causal relevance suffices for value's non-epiphenomenality.
