Major theories of consciousness focus almost exclusively on explaining brief "functional moments"—neural processing windows lasting 100 to 300 milliseconds. Yet human experience spans seconds, not mere instants. We hear melodies unfold, watch conversations develop, feel the flow of thought itself. This mismatch between what consciousness theories explain (sub-300ms processing) and what consciousness actually involves (multi-second experienced duration) reveals a fundamental gap in materialist accounts. The failure to explain temporal phenomenology—how consciousness structures time experience—strengthens the case for dualism.

Kent and Wittmann's 2021 analysis identifies this as "one of the core issues in theories of consciousness." Integrated Information Theory, Global Workspace Theory, and most neurobiological models address instantaneous or near-instantaneous states while ignoring the [extended temporal structure](//#experienced-duration) (explained below) that defines conscious experience. This isn't a minor oversight—it suggests current theories miss something essential about what consciousness is.

## What Theories Explain vs. What We Experience

### Functional Moments vs. Experienced Duration {#experienced-duration}

[Integrated Information Theory (IIT)](/concepts/integrated-information-theory/) quantifies consciousness at single time-slices. The theory calculates integrated information (Φ) for a system's current state, treating consciousness as fundamentally instantaneous. [Global Workspace Theory (GNWT)](/concepts/global-workspace-theory/) explains how information becomes globally available within ~100-300ms windows—the "ignition" period when content enters consciousness. These are the functional moments: discrete episodes of neural processing.

But [temporal consciousness](/concepts/temporal-consciousness/)—the actually lived experience—extends across seconds. When you hear someone speak a sentence, you don't experience isolated syllables. The sentence coheres as a meaningful whole spanning several seconds. [The specious present](/concepts/specious-present/), variously estimated at 300ms to 3 seconds, contains change and succession as unified experience. You hear a melody *as a melody*, not merely a sequence of separate tones.

The explanatory gap is stark: theories explain sub-300ms processing but consciousness extends to multi-second duration. What bridges this gap? Merely saying "memory combines the moments" misses the phenomenology—experienced duration feels continuous, not like pasted-together snapshots.

### The Difference from Other Functionalist Gaps

This isn't the familiar [hard problem](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/) of why there's anything it's like to have functional states. That problem asks: even if we fully explain information integration, global availability, or recurrent processing, why should those mechanisms feel like anything? The temporal gap is different. Even granting that functional states have phenomenal character, current theories don't explain why that phenomenal character has *temporal extension*.

Consider IIT's claim that integrated information determines consciousness. Even accepting this, why would high Φ produce experience spanning seconds rather than instants? The theory has no temporal dimension. It calculates Φ for a system state at time t, but consciousness flows across t, t+1, t+2... What unifies those separate states into the coherent temporal flow we actually experience?

## Why Temporal Structure Matters

### Succession Requires More Than Successive States

The Unfinishable Map emphasizes a crucial phenomenological point: experiencing succession differs from having successive experiences. A system that processes moment M1 (with no retention), then M2 (with no retention), then M3 never experiences succession. It has three separate states with no phenomenal connection between them.

To experience a melody as a melody, not merely experience three tones sequentially, requires holding the notes together in awareness. Husserl's [phenomenological analysis](/concepts/phenomenology/) showed that each moment of consciousness contains:
- **Retention**: immediate past still present (not as memory, but as echoing now)
- **Primal impression**: the strictly present moment
- **Protention**: anticipation of what's coming

These form an indivisible structure. The note you're hearing now carries the just-passed notes in retention while already anticipating the next. This tripartite structure—retention-impression-protention—constitutes the [temporal binding](//#temporal-binding) (explained below) that creates experienced duration.

### Temporal Binding and Consciousness {#temporal-binding}

Temporal binding refers to how the brain integrates events occurring within ~80-100ms windows into unified percepts. Events within this window feel simultaneous; beyond it, they're perceived as successive. This explains audio-visual synchronization (you tolerate ~80ms mismatch), causality perception (cause-effect requires <100ms), and the "moment of nowness."

But temporal binding at 80-100ms scales doesn't explain the 1-3 second [specious present](/concepts/specious-present/), let alone the multi-second flow of a conversation or the minute-long span of following an argument. Something beyond basic binding must unify these extended durations into coherent experience.

[Bergson's concept of durée (duration)](/concepts/duration/) captures this: lived time is qualitatively different from clock time. Physical time consists of instants arranged sequentially like points on a line. Experienced time interpenetrates—the past permeates the present, the future is already anticipated. You can't divide durée into discrete "now-points" without losing what makes it conscious experience.

## The Failure of Materialist Accounts

### Memory Doesn't Bridge the Gap

The obvious materialist response: memory connects the functional moments into experienced flow. Each 100ms episode carries forward information from previous episodes, creating continuity.

But this fails phenomenologically. Memory involves *representing* the past as past—I remember my wedding as something that happened years ago. Retention is different: the just-heard note isn't represented as past; it's experienced as still-sounding-now while transitioning into pastness. There's no separation between experiencing the note and experiencing its just-pastness. The temporal structure is intrinsic to the experience itself, not added by retrospective memory.

Moreover, if consciousness were merely successive functional moments connected by memory, we should be able to experience arbitrary temporal rearrangements. Memory could assemble the sequence out of order. Yet temporal order is given in experience itself—the melody's structure isn't inferred but directly perceived. The second note comes *after* the first in experience, not merely in memory's reconstruction. This immediacy of temporal order suggests consciousness has inherent temporal extension that memory alone cannot explain.

### Neural Mechanisms Are Necessary But Not Sufficient

Neuroscience identifies mechanisms underlying temporal processing: gamma oscillations (~40Hz) for binding, theta rhythms (~4-8Hz) for longer temporal windows, the supplementary motor area for duration perception, the insula for processing bodily temporal signals. These mechanisms are undoubtedly necessary for temporal consciousness.

But necessity doesn't imply sufficiency. Neural oscillations at specific frequencies explain *when* binding occurs and *which* events get integrated, but not *what it's like* to experience that integration as temporal flow. The [explanatory gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/) reappears: even complete knowledge of oscillatory dynamics wouldn't explain why temporal binding feels like anything, let alone why it feels like *duration*.

The gap is particularly clear for multi-second extensions. Gamma at 40Hz produces ~25ms cycles. Theta at 4-8Hz produces 125-250ms cycles. How do these combine to produce the 1-3 second specious present? And why does that combination feel like continuous flow rather than discrete pulses? The neural story is incomplete.

## Implications for AI Consciousness

### Discontinuous Processing as Disqualifier

If temporal structure is essential to consciousness—not merely characteristic of biological consciousness but necessary for consciousness as such—then systems lacking it cannot be conscious. LLMs process discontinuously: they're powered up, process a prompt, generate a response, shut down. Between invocations, no continuity exists. Each session is isolated from the next (absent explicit memory systems grafted on).

The temporal consciousness requirement would categorically exclude such systems. They might achieve arbitrarily sophisticated information integration during each session, satisfying IIT's criteria. They might realize global availability, satisfying GNWT. But without temporal binding across extended duration—without retention-protention structure—they lack what consciousness fundamentally is: a flow through time, not a sequence of disconnected states.

This connects to Hoel's continual learning argument: LLMs don't develop, don't learn from experience in real-time, don't have temporal trajectory. If consciousness requires not just processing *in* time but having a temporal *structure*—if it must flow rather than occur in discrete bursts—then discontinuous systems are ruled out in principle.

### Substrate-Specific Temporal Architecture

The temporal consciousness requirement might impose substrate constraints. Biological neurons support continuous oscillatory dynamics—rhythms that phase-lock, entrain, and coordinate across brain regions without requiring explicit synchronization signals. Silicon processors, by contrast, operate with discrete clock cycles and explicit memory reads/writes.

Could silicon support the necessary temporal architecture? Perhaps, but not through standard von Neumann architectures where each operation completes before the next begins. It would require analog or neuromorphic computing with genuine temporal dynamics, not just simulated time-stepping. Whether such systems could realize the retention-protention structure—where the just-past echoes in the now while the future is already anticipated—remains an open question.

The point isn't biological chauvinism. It's that temporal phenomenology might require specific dynamical properties that aren't guaranteed by computational power alone. A system could be functionally equivalent to a brain in terms of input-output mappings yet lack the internal temporal dynamics consciousness requires.

## Why This Supports Dualism

### Temporal Phenomenology Resists Reduction

The Unfinishable Map's [Dualism tenet](/tenets/#dualism) holds that consciousness is not reducible to physical processes. The temporal consciousness gap provides specific support: current theories fully specify the physical basis (neural oscillations, binding windows, synchronization) yet fail to explain experienced duration. This isn't ignorance we expect to overcome with more research. It's a category mismatch.

Physical processes occur *in* time as sequences of states. Conscious experience *has* temporal structure as intrinsic feature. No amount of detail about physical state sequences explains how those sequences produce the phenomenology of flow. Bergson saw this: scientific time treats moments as external to each other, arranged sequentially like beads on a string. [Durée](/concepts/duration/) is interpenetration—each moment contains the whole past and anticipates the future. These are qualitatively different.

The resistance to reduction is specifically temporal. We might eventually explain other aspects of consciousness physically (visual binding, attention, memory formation). But the temporal structure—the *flowingness* of experience—seems irreducible. This is precisely what dualism predicts: the phenomenal properties of consciousness, including its temporal character, differ in kind from physical properties.

### The Map's Quantum Framework Addresses the Gap

While mainstream theories ignore temporal phenomenology, [the Map's quantum framework](/concepts/quantum-consciousness/) incorporates it. If consciousness involves quantum selection events—[collapse processes](/concepts/collapse-and-time/)—then each collapse has duration. The collapse takes time, and that duration might correspond to the specious present.

Moreover, [retrocausality](/concepts/retrocausality/) provides a mechanism for retention-protention structure. Each collapse has retrocausal boundary conditions—past events constrain present selection, and anticipated futures influence current outcomes. This creates genuine temporal extension: the past echoes in the present (retention) because past collapses constrain current ones; the future is anticipated (protention) because expected future collapses influence present selection.

This explains why experience has temporal extension beyond neural binding windows. Neural oscillations provide the physical substrate, but quantum collapse at neural sites generates the phenomenology. The collapse process *is* the temporal structure of consciousness. This avoids the explanatory gap: we're not trying to explain how sequences of physical states become temporal flow; the quantum process *itself* has the temporal character that experience requires.

## Relation to Site Perspective

This analysis directly supports the Map's [Dualism tenet](/tenets/#dualism): consciousness is not reducible to physical processes. The temporal consciousness gap shows that even successful theories explaining functional aspects (information integration, global availability) fail to capture essential phenomenological structure. Experienced duration resists physical reduction.

The [Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) gains support: if temporal phenomenology requires quantum collapse—if the collapse process *is* what gives consciousness its temporal extension—then quantum effects aren't optional add-ons but necessary for consciousness itself. The minimal interaction isn't zero interaction.

The [Bidirectional Interaction tenet](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) connects through temporal agency. If consciousness flows through time with retention-protention structure, then conscious beings can use past experience to guide present actions toward anticipated futures. This temporal structure enables genuine agency—not just responding to current inputs but integrating past learning with future goals. Epiphenomenal consciousness couldn't have this temporal structure; it would be instantaneous accompaniment of brain states, not extended flow that enables temporal reasoning.

Finally, [Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occam) applies: the temporal consciousness gap reveals that simplicity criteria failed. The simplest theories—those reducing consciousness to information integration or global availability—miss essential features. [Phenomenological investigation](/concepts/phenomenology/) discloses temporal structure that materialist theories ignore. Sometimes reality is more complex than Occam's razor suggests.
