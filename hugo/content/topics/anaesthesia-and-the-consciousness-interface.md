Anaesthesia does not simply switch consciousness off. Different anaesthetic agents disrupt different components of the consciousness-brain interface, and the pharmacological specificity of these disruptions amounts to a molecular map of how consciousness connects to neural activity. The Unfinishable Map's [interactionist framework](/concepts/interactionist-dualism/) predicts exactly this kind of structured, multi-layered interface — and anaesthetic pharmacology provides some of the best empirical evidence for its architecture.

The key insight is that anaesthetic agents are not interchangeable. Propofol, ketamine, xenon, sevoflurane, and nitrous oxide each target different molecular sites, disrupt different neural dynamics, and produce different phenomenological outcomes — yet all render patients behaviourally unresponsive. If consciousness were simply "produced" by neural activity, this pharmacological diversity would be a curiosity. Under the Map's [filter theory](/concepts/filter-theory/), it reveals that the consciousness-brain interface has distinct, separable components that can be individually disrupted.

## The Meyer-Overton Correlation and Its Limits

For over a century, the Meyer-Overton correlation — the observation that anaesthetic potency correlates with lipid solubility — suggested that anaesthetics work through a single, simple mechanism: dissolving into cell membranes and disrupting neural function nonspecifically. If true, this would support a production model in which consciousness is a generic product of neural activity that can be generically suppressed.

The correlation has not survived modern pharmacology. Anaesthetics act through specific molecular targets: GABA-A receptors (propofol, sevoflurane), NMDA receptors (ketamine, xenon), two-pore potassium channels (volatile agents), and glycine receptors (several inhalational agents). Some compounds with high lipid solubility produce no anaesthesia at all, while others with low solubility are potent anaesthetics. The correlation was real but misleading — lipid solubility correlated with anaesthetic potency because the relevant protein targets happen to sit in lipid environments, not because lipid disruption itself causes unconsciousness.

This matters for the interface question. A nonspecific membrane effect would suggest consciousness depends on generic neural function. Specific receptor targets suggest it depends on particular molecular systems — precisely the kind of structured interface the Map's framework requires.

## Pharmacological Dissection of the Interface

Different anaesthetic classes disrupt different aspects of conscious experience, revealing at least four separable interface components.

### Phenomenal Presence

Propofol, acting primarily through GABA-A receptors, abolishes phenomenal experience almost completely. Patients report nothing — no dreams, no sense of time, no residual awareness. Brain complexity measured by the perturbational complexity index (PCI) drops dramatically. The posterior cortical "hot zone" identified by recent adversarial consciousness research as the substrate of conscious content falls largely silent.

This suggests GABA-A-mediated inhibition disrupts the interface component responsible for phenomenal presence itself — the basic fact that there is something it is like.

### Content Without Access

Ketamine, blocking NMDA receptors, produces a radically different pattern. Behavioural unresponsiveness is equivalent to propofol, yet patients report vivid experiences — elaborate dreams, perceived journeys, encounters with other beings. Brain dynamics under ketamine remain similar to waking consciousness in their complexity. Ketamine dissociates phenomenal experience from behavioural access: consciousness continues, but its connection to motor output and environmental responsiveness is severed.

On the Map's framework, ketamine disrupts the interface's access channels — the pathways through which consciousness connects to action and environmental engagement — while leaving the phenomenal interface largely intact. This is consistent with the [attention-motor architecture](/topics/the-interface-location-problem/) as a distinct interface layer: ketamine spares the posterior hot zone (phenomenal presence) while disrupting frontoparietal connectivity (access and control).

### Temporal Binding

Volatile agents like sevoflurane and isoflurane act on multiple receptor types simultaneously, producing a characteristic phenomenology: fragmented, disjointed experience before full unconsciousness, with disintegration of temporal coherence. Patients in light sevoflurane sedation report experiences that lack temporal ordering — events seem to float without sequence.

This suggests volatile agents disrupt the interface's temporal binding function — the mechanism by which consciousness organises neural events into coherent temporal experience. The [binding problem](/concepts/binding-problem/) identifies temporal integration as one of the hardest challenges for any theory of consciousness; anaesthetic disruption of temporal binding may reveal the specific interface mechanisms responsible.

### Memory Encoding

Nearly all anaesthetics disrupt explicit memory formation at sub-anaesthetic doses — patients who remain conscious and responsive still fail to form lasting memories. Midazolam (a benzodiazepine) produces profound amnesia with minimal sedation, isolating the memory-encoding function almost surgically from other interface components.

This dissociation — consciousness present, memory encoding absent — reveals that the interface's connection to memory systems is pharmacologically separable from its phenomenal and access components. The Map interprets this as evidence that the interface has dedicated channels for different cognitive functions, not a single on/off switch.

## The Active Reboot Problem

Perhaps the most revealing anaesthetic phenomenon is how consciousness returns. Recovery from general anaesthesia is not simply the reverse of induction. As anaesthetic agents clear from the brain, neural systems appear to actively prepare for the return of consciousness through specific molecular mechanisms, including downregulation of the KCC2 chloride transporter.

This active reboot is difficult to explain on production models. If the brain simply produces consciousness as a by-product of neural activity, consciousness should return passively as drug effects dissipate — like a light coming back on when you stop pressing the dimmer switch. Instead, the brain undertakes specific preparatory steps, as if orienting itself to receive something from elsewhere.

The Map reads this as evidence for [bidirectional interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction). The brain prepares the interface for consciousness to re-engage, suggesting that the neural side of the interface requires active maintenance. Consciousness does not simply emerge from sufficient neural activity; the brain must configure itself appropriately for the interface to function.

## Consciousness Monitoring and the Measurement Problem

Clinical anaesthesiology has developed several technologies to monitor consciousness during surgery — bispectral index (BIS), PCI, and measures of cortical connectivity. These monitors track the *interface* rather than consciousness itself, measuring neural correlates that typically accompany conscious states.

The limitation is telling. No monitor directly detects the presence or absence of consciousness. All infer consciousness from neural signatures — and all fail in some cases. BIS monitoring cannot distinguish ketamine's vivid conscious states from propofol's phenomenal extinction, since both produce similar behavioural and some similar electroencephalographic patterns. PCI performs better by measuring cortical complexity, but even this tracks the neural side of the interface rather than consciousness per se.

This measurement gap parallels a deeper philosophical point. If consciousness were identical to the neural processes being monitored, perfect monitoring should in principle be possible. The persistent gap between neural measurement and conscious presence is what the Map expects: monitors measure the physical interface, but the non-physical consciousness that engages through that interface cannot be captured by physical measurement alone.

## Anaesthetic Resistance and Interface Variation

Individual variation in anaesthetic sensitivity provides further evidence of interface structure. Redheads carrying MC1R gene variants require approximately 20% more anaesthetic than average. Chronic alcohol users develop cross-tolerance to many anaesthetics. Some individuals display paradoxical reactions — increased agitation rather than sedation — to benzodiazepines.

If consciousness were a uniform product of neural activity, anaesthetic sensitivity should vary with brain size or metabolic rate, not with specific genetic variants affecting particular receptor systems. The observed pattern — sensitivity varying with specific molecular targets — supports the structured interface model. Different individuals have different interface configurations, making some components easier or harder to disrupt pharmacologically.

## What Anaesthesia Cannot Tell Us

Anaesthetic evidence constrains but does not determine the interface's ultimate nature. Several limitations apply.

Anaesthesia demonstrates that specific molecular systems are necessary for the interface to function, but does not prove these systems are *where* consciousness connects. Disrupting a radio's power supply eliminates reception without the power supply being where the signal arrives. Some anaesthetic targets may be interface infrastructure rather than interface points.

The pharmacological map is also incomplete. Current anaesthetics were discovered largely through empirical trial rather than theoretical prediction. Undiscovered interface components — those not targeted by any known drug — would be invisible to pharmacological dissection. The map shows what current tools can reach, not the full territory.

Finally, anaesthetic evidence cannot distinguish between the Map's interactionist interpretation and a sophisticated functionalist account in which consciousness supervenes on specific neural dynamics. Both predict that disrupting particular molecular systems should alter consciousness in specific ways. The distinguishing evidence must come from elsewhere — from the [hard problem](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/) itself, from the [active reboot phenomenon](/topics/loss-of-consciousness/#the-active-reboot), and from cases where consciousness persists despite profound neural disruption.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Anaesthetic pharmacology connects to each of the Map's [tenets](/tenets/) in concrete ways.

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: The pharmacological dissection of the interface reveals a structured, multi-component connection between consciousness and neural activity. A simple identity relation — consciousness *is* neural activity — predicts that disrupting neural activity should uniformly diminish consciousness. The observed pattern — different agents disrupting different phenomenal dimensions — fits the Map's model of consciousness as something that connects to the brain through a structured interface, not something identical to brain processes.

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)**: Several anaesthetic targets, particularly ion channels and receptor proteins, operate at scales where quantum effects are relevant. The specificity of anaesthetic action — particular drugs targeting particular molecular sites — is consistent with the interface operating through quantum-sensitive molecular systems. The [constrained pluralism](/topics/the-interface-location-problem/) position gains support: the interface operates through the attention-motor architecture at the functional level, with molecular-level quantum effects in receptor proteins and ion channels providing the physical substrate.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)**: The active reboot phenomenon — the brain preparing for consciousness to return rather than consciousness passively re-emerging — suggests causal traffic in both directions. The brain configures the interface; consciousness engages through it. Neither is passive.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)**: A single-mechanism account of anaesthesia would be simpler. The reality — multiple receptor types, multiple phenomenological effects, complex interactions — is not simple. The consciousness-brain interface, like other fundamental systems in nature, may resist simple explanation because it is genuinely complex.
