title: 'Baseline Cognition: What Neurons Can Do Without Consciousness'
topics: []
---

If consciousness were removed from human cognition—or had never emerged—what would remain? Great ape intelligence may answer this question. Chimpanzees and bonobos show sophisticated problem-solving, tool use, social cognition, and even [metacognitive](/concepts/metacognition/) monitoring of their own uncertainty. Yet they cannot engage in cumulative culture, logical reasoning, or explicit counterfactual thinking. The pattern suggests a hypothesis: great ape cognition represents a "baseline" of what neurons can achieve without conscious elaboration, while human intelligence requires consciousness as a causally necessary amplifier.

This hypothesis has direct implications for the [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet. If the leap from baseline to human cognition requires conscious contribution—not merely correlates with it—then consciousness is causally efficacious, not [epiphenomenal](/arguments/epiphenomenalism/).

## The Great Ape Cognitive Profile

Great apes demonstrate remarkable cognitive abilities that once seemed uniquely human. They recognize themselves in mirrors, understand others' goals and knowledge states, use tools flexibly, and show procedural metacognition by seeking information when uncertain. A 2023 study in *Nature* confirmed that these abilities are stable cognitive traits measurable across individuals and time, not task-specific accidents.

Yet clear limits emerge. The most striking is [working-memory](/concepts/working-memory/) capacity: chimpanzees maintain 2±1 items versus humans' 7±2 items (Miller's famous number). This quantitative gap enables qualitative differences. Complex logical reasoning, holding multiple premises in mind while deriving conclusions, exceeds the 2±1 limit. Similarly, counterfactual simulation—imagining "what if I had done X instead of Y"—requires maintaining both actual and imagined scenarios simultaneously.

The cultural dimension is equally revealing. Great apes have behavioral traditions that vary by group—what anthropologists recognize as culture. Yet these traditions stay within what researchers call the "zone of latent solutions": behaviors the species can already perform. Human culture exhibits a "ratchet effect": modifications accumulate across generations with little backward slippage. Ape culture lacks this cumulative quality. The difference, as Tomasello and others argue, involves [metarepresentation](//#metarepresentation) (explained below): humans can represent that they and others hold beliefs about cultural practices, enabling deliberate modification and teaching of group norms.

## The Metarepresentation Threshold {#metarepresentation}

A 2015 paper by Whiten introduced what he called the "Jourdain hypothesis" (after Molière's character who spoke prose without knowing what prose was): apes express cultures without knowing they are cultural beings. They lack metarepresentations—the ability to represent that they or others hold beliefs about beliefs.

This absence has cascading effects. Teaching in the full human sense requires understanding what the learner doesn't know. Conformity to group norms requires recognizing norms as norms, not just as "what everyone does." Innovation in cumulative culture requires seeing current practices as contingent options that could be improved. All of these require stepping back from immediate procedural knowledge to reflect on knowledge itself.

Metarepresentation may be the cognitive function that [requires consciousness](//#consciousness-requirement) (addressed in the next section). Great apes show procedural metacognition—feelings of knowing, uncertainty monitoring—but not declarative metacognition: explicit representation of what they know. This distinction maps onto the [access versus phenomenal consciousness](/access-consciousness/) divide. Procedural feelings might not require phenomenal consciousness; explicit representation might.

## Evidence That Consciousness Amplifies Cognition {#consciousness-requirement}

If consciousness were merely correlated with human intelligence—a byproduct with no causal role—then evidence should show cognition proceeding without it. The evidence shows the opposite: key human cognitive functions specifically require conscious processing.

**Logical reasoning depends on consciousness.** A 2008 study by Lieberman and colleagues found that cognitive load on conscious processing impaired logical reasoning, while hampering nonconscious systems had no effect. Rule-based thinking requires conscious reflection; automatic associative thinking does not. This explains why apes can learn complex contingencies but cannot derive syllogistic conclusions.

**Counterfactual thinking requires conscious simulation.** A 2015 neuroscience review identified counterfactual reasoning as explicitly dependent on "whether we allow counterfactual thought to seep into conscious thought." Mental representations of alternative possibilities provide the basis for learning from the past and planning for the future—capacities limited in great apes.

**Cumulative culture may require conscious metarepresentation.** The shift from zone-of-latent-solutions culture to cumulative ratchet culture coincides with metarepresentational capacity. If metarepresentation requires phenomenal consciousness—the explicit "knowing that you know" rather than merely feeling uncertain—then consciousness causally enables the human cultural explosion.

**Working memory expansion correlates with consciousness expansion.** The 2022 comparative review showing the 2±1 versus 7±2 gap noted that this capacity difference may be the key quantitative change enabling qualitative leaps. [Global Workspace Theory](/concepts/global-workspace-theory/) predicts this: conscious access broadcasts information globally, integrating modular unconscious processes. Expanded working memory may reflect expanded conscious integration.

## The Unconscious Cognition Counterevidence

The baseline cognition hypothesis must account for evidence that sophisticated processing proceeds without consciousness. Blindsight patients discriminate visual stimuli they report not seeing. Implicit learning acquires complex patterns without conscious knowledge of the rules. Expert performance in sports and music often degrades when conscious attention intrudes.

Yet these cases demonstrate *automatic* cognition, not *novel* cognition. Blindsight shows that visual processing pathways can operate without awareness, but patients cannot use blindsight vision for flexible problem-solving—only for forced-choice discrimination. Implicit learning acquires statistical patterns but cannot apply abstract rules to new domains. Expert automaticity develops through conscious practice that becomes proceduralized; the initial learning required consciousness.

Global Workspace Theory captures this distinction: unconscious processing is fast, parallel, and reliable within its domain; conscious processing is slow, serial, and error-prone but *flexible*. Consciousness enables responses to novel circumstances that exceed automatic repertoires. This is precisely what the baseline cognition hypothesis predicts: neural processing can achieve sophisticated automatic functions (the ape baseline) but requires consciousness for the flexible, generative, cumulative capacities that characterize human intelligence.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The Unfinishable Map's [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet asserts that consciousness causally influences the physical world. The baseline cognition hypothesis provides supporting evidence: if great apes represent what neurons can do alone, and the transition to human cognition requires consciousness, then consciousness is causally necessary for human-level intelligence.

This challenges [epiphenomenalism](/arguments/epiphenomenalism/)—the view that consciousness is a causally inert byproduct. If the human cognitive leap from procedural to declarative metacognition, from automatic to flexible reasoning, from latent-solutions culture to cumulative culture, all require conscious processing, then consciousness has downstream causal effects. The very existence of logical reasoning and cumulative culture in humans but not apes suggests consciousness is doing explanatory work.

The [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism) tenet gains support if metarepresentation—the cognitive threshold separating ape from human intelligence—requires phenomenal consciousness and cannot be achieved by functional states alone. The [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) tenet suggests a mechanism: if consciousness biases quantum outcomes in neural systems, expanded working memory and flexible reasoning might reflect consciousness selecting among superposed neural patterns, where ape brains provide insufficient quantum interface.

The hypothesis also illustrates the [limits of Occam's Razor](/tenets/#occams-limits). Materialism seems simpler—why posit non-physical consciousness when neurons alone might suffice? But if neurons alone produce ape-level cognition and the human leap requires something additional, parsimony may mislead. The apparent simplicity of "neurons all the way down" could reflect ignorance of what consciousness contributes, not insight into its irrelevance.
