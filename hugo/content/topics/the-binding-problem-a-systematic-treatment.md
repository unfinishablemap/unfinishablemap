The Unfinishable Map treats binding as not one problem but a family of related problems, each revealing something distinct about consciousness. The binding problem is usually introduced through vision — how does the brain combine colour, shape, and motion into one object? — but this undersells its scope. Binding operates across sensory modalities, across time, across cognitive domains, and between experiences and their subject. Each variety resists physical explanation in its own way, yet they share a common structure: physical processes that are separate must somehow become experiential wholes. Mapping this family systematically reveals that the difficulty is not piecemeal — it is not that we lack solutions to five separate puzzles — but structural. The same gap between coordination and unity appears everywhere consciousness appears.

## The Foundational Distinction: BP1 and BP2

Every binding problem splits into two sub-problems (Revonsuo 2006). Understanding this distinction is essential before surveying the varieties.

**BP1 (Computational Binding)** asks how the brain coordinates distributed processing. How does the visual system assign "red" and "round" to the same object rather than swapping features between objects? This is a tractable information-processing problem. Neuroscience has identified plausible mechanisms — [gamma synchrony](/neural-binding-mechanisms/), thalamocortical loops, attentional gating — and continues to make progress.

**BP2 (Phenomenal Binding)** asks why coordinated processing produces unified experience. Even granting a complete solution to BP1, we haven't explained why the bound information feels like one thing rather than parallel streams happening to be coordinated. This is the [hard-problem-of-consciousness](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/) applied to unity — and it appears in every variety of binding described below.

The distinction matters because BP1 solutions are routinely mistaken for BP2 solutions. Explaining *how* features are coordinated does not explain *why* coordination produces phenomenal unity. This confusion runs through much of the binding literature and obscures what remains genuinely unsolved. See [binding-problem](/concepts/binding-problem/) for extended treatment.

## Five Varieties of Binding

### 1. Intra-Modal Binding

The textbook case. Within a single sensory modality, features processed in separate cortical regions must combine into unified percepts. When you see a red ball bouncing, redness (V4), roundness (inferotemporal cortex), and motion (MT/V5) are processed by different neural populations. Yet your experience presents one moving red ball.

**BP1 progress**: Feature Integration Theory (Treisman 1980) proposes that attention is the "glue" — spatial attention integrates all features at a location into a unified object representation. Gamma-band synchrony (30-100 Hz) tags same-object features through temporal coincidence. Illusory conjunctions under divided attention — seeing a blue circle when presented with a blue square and a yellow circle — confirm that binding requires attentional resources and can fail predictably.

**BP2 gap**: Synchronized firing is still firing in separate neurons. Even perfect temporal coincidence does not produce ontological unity — correlation is not identity. Why does temporal tagging *feel* unified? The mechanism explains when binding succeeds or fails but not why successful binding produces unified experience rather than correctly labelled parallel streams.

### 2. Cross-Modal Binding {#cross-modal}

Different sensory modalities process information in spatially separate cortical regions, at different speeds (vision ~50ms, audition ~10ms, touch ~15ms), using different neural codes. Yet when these modalities refer to the same external event — a hand clapping — you experience a single multimodal percept, not three parallel streams. See [multimodal-binding](/multimodal-binding/) and [phenomenal-binding-and-holism](/concepts/phenomenal-binding-and-holism/) for detailed analysis.

**BP1 progress**: Superior colliculus multisensory neurons receive converging inputs from visual, auditory, and somatosensory pathways, showing supralinear responses to spatiotemporally congruent stimuli. The thalamus coordinates oscillatory activity across cortical regions. Global Workspace Theory proposes that sensory information binds through broadcasting to a shared cortical-thalamic system within a ~100ms integration window.

**BP2 gap**: Cross-modal binding makes the [explanatory-gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/) maximally stark. Different modalities don't just process in different locations — they use fundamentally different representational formats. The qualitative character of visual experience differs in kind from auditory experience. How does the brain create a single experience encompassing both colour and sound? Convergence zones explain information routing; they do not explain why information from incommensurable modalities produces unified phenomenology.

### 3. Temporal Binding {#temporal}

Experience extends across time. The present moment is not a durationless instant but a "specious present" containing recently past and immediately anticipated events. When you hear a melody, each note arrives sequentially, yet you experience the musical phrase as a temporal whole — the notes are bound into a progression with structure and direction. See [temporal-consciousness](/concepts/temporal-consciousness/) and [autonoetic-consciousness](/concepts/autonoetic-consciousness/).

**BP1 progress**: Working memory maintains representations across seconds. Hippocampal replay compresses temporal sequences. Oscillatory dynamics create temporal windows within which events are treated as co-occurring. The brain can retroactively adjust the perceived timing of events — later processing adjusts timestamps to construct phenomenal simultaneity.

**BP2 gap**: Temporal binding raises a distinctive puzzle. At any physical instant, only the current state exists — past states have ceased, future states have not begun. Yet consciousness encompasses temporal extension. The heard melody is not a sequence of separate "now-experiences" strung together retrospectively; it is experienced as a temporal arc. What makes a temporal sequence a *unified temporal experience* rather than a series of disconnected moments? Neural mechanisms that maintain information across time (working memory, hippocampal replay) explain how the brain retains past content but not why retained content is experienced as temporally extended rather than merely stored.

[autonoetic-consciousness](/concepts/autonoetic-consciousness/) — the capacity to re-experience one's own past — reveals temporal binding in its most demanding form. When you remember a childhood event, "pastness" is phenomenally bound to the content. You are simultaneously present as rememberer (now) and protagonist (then). Two temporal perspectives are unified in a single experience without collapsing into one.

### 4. Cognitive Binding {#cognitive}

Beyond perception, binding operates in thought, reasoning, and language. When you understand the sentence "The cat that the dog chased climbed the tree," you bind sequentially encountered words into a hierarchical structure — and the "click" when the sentence coheres resembles perceptual binding. See [language-recursion-and-consciousness](/topics/language-recursion-and-consciousness/) and [cognitive-phenomenology](/concepts/cognitive-phenomenology/).

**BP1 progress**: Recursive syntactic processing involves prefrontal-temporal circuits. [working-memory](/concepts/working-memory/) maintains structural representations during incremental parsing. Semantic integration involves widespread cortical activation that converges into unified meaning representations.

**BP2 gap**: Cognitive binding involves [cognitive phenomenology](/concepts/cognitive-phenomenology/) — the felt quality of understanding, the experience of meaning. When a complex argument "clicks," there is something it is like to grasp the whole that exceeds what it is like to grasp each premise separately. This is Bayne and Chalmers's "conjoint phenomenology" applied to thought rather than perception. Just as seeing-and-hearing-simultaneously has a unified phenomenal character, understanding-all-the-parts-together has a phenomenal character that exceeds the sum of understanding each part.

Structural ambiguity makes this vivid. "I saw the man with the telescope" admits two parsings: you used a telescope, or the man had one. Consciousness selects among binding configurations — and the selection has phenomenal consequences. If binding involves quantum collapse, this parsing selection may be a phenomenal correlate of [agent causation](/concepts/agent-causation/): consciousness choosing which cognitive binding becomes actual.

### 5. Subject Binding {#subject}

The most fundamental variety: all experiences are had by a single subject. Your visual perception, auditory sensation, emotional feeling, and cognitive thought do not merely co-occur — they belong to *you*. There is a fact about whose experiences they are.

**BP1 progress**: Self-referential processing involves midline cortical structures (medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate). The "default mode network" maintains a sense of self across task states. Proprioceptive integration produces a sense of bodily ownership.

**BP2 gap**: Subject binding may be the deepest variety because it cannot be stated in purely computational terms. The question "why are these experiences all mine?" presupposes a subject for whom the binding obtains. No neural mechanism for self-reference explains why there is a *subject* at all — why there is someone for whom these processes are unified rather than parallel processes with no owner. The [self](/concepts/self-and-consciousness/) is not another content that gets bound to other contents; it is the perspective from which binding is experienced.

[Split-brain cases](/topics/split-brain-consciousness/) test subject binding directly. When the corpus callosum is severed, perceptual binding partially divides. But does the *subject* divide? Nagel argued the result is "too much unity to say 'two', yet too much separation to say 'one'." Phenomenal unity proves more resilient than neural connectivity alone would predict — pointing toward binding mechanisms that transcend local neural correlation.

## The Shared Structure

These five varieties are not five independent problems. They share a common structure:

1. **Physical processes are distributed** — across brain regions, across time, across representational formats
2. **Neural mechanisms coordinate** these distributed processes — through synchrony, convergence, oscillatory dynamics
3. **Experience is unified** — the coordinated information is experienced as one thing, not many coordinated things
4. **The gap between 2 and 3 resists explanation** — coordination does not produce ontological unity

The persistence of this gap across all five varieties is the strongest evidence that it reflects something structural rather than a series of coincidental explanatory failures. If intra-modal binding were solved but cross-modal binding remained mysterious, we might attribute the difficulty to the added complexity of cross-modal integration. But the same gap appears in temporal binding, cognitive binding, and subject binding. The problem is not the details of any particular domain — it is the transition from coordinated plurality to experiential unity as such.

This convergence has an important implication: any successful explanation of binding must work across all five varieties simultaneously. A theory that explains perceptual binding but cannot address temporal or subject binding has explained BP1, not BP2. Phenomenal unity is a general feature of consciousness, not a domain-specific trick.

## Dissociations: BP1 Without BP2

The strongest evidence that computational and phenomenal binding are different in kind comes from cases where they dissociate.

**NREM sleep**: During deep sleep, the brain performs extensive computational binding — consolidating memories, integrating information, maintaining neural synchrony. Yet phenomenal unity is absent. [Sleep](/concepts/sleep-and-consciousness/) demonstrates that BP1 operations proceed without BP2. If phenomenal unity were merely a product of computational binding, it should be present whenever computational binding occurs.

**Anesthesia**: Under general anesthesia, isolated brain regions remain active and locally coordinated. Information processing continues. But there is no unified experience. Anesthesia disrupts phenomenal binding while leaving substantial computational binding intact.

**Unconscious multisensory processing**: Subliminal cross-modal integration occurs — the brain combines visual and auditory information below the threshold of awareness. The information is computationally bound without being phenomenally bound. These cases show that the neural machinery for BP1 is not sufficient for BP2.

The converse also occurs: phenomenal unity sometimes exceeds computational binding. Filling-in — where the visual system fabricates content at the blind spot — produces phenomenal unity without corresponding computational binding at the retinal level. The experience is unified where the information processing is not. These dissociations confirm that BP1 and BP2 are different explanatory targets requiring different explanations.

## Theoretical Landscape

### Classical Approaches

Classical approaches address BP1 with increasing sophistication but leave BP2 untouched. Each redescribes rather than explains phenomenal unity:

- **Binding by synchrony** says unity is temporal coincidence — but coincidence is not identity
- **Global Workspace Theory** says unity is global availability — but availability is functional, not experiential
- **IIT** says consciousness *is* integration — but integration is an information-theoretic property, and saying "unity is integration" doesn't explain why integration produces subjective experience

All classical approaches inherit the same structural limitation: they combine, correlate, or integrate things that remain metaphysically distinct. Classical physics describes external relations between parts. It cannot create ontological unity from ontological plurality. See [phenomenal-binding-and-holism](/concepts/phenomenal-binding-and-holism/) for the full argument.

### The Quantum Alternative

Quantum entanglement provides something structurally different from classical coordination: genuine holism where the whole is prior to parts. An entangled system has properties that neither subsystem possesses individually. This is not correlation — it is irreducible unity at the level of physics itself. See [quantum-binding-and-phenomenal-unity](/topics/quantum-binding-and-phenomenal-unity/) for detailed treatment.

The structural correspondence between quantum holism and phenomenal unity is significant: both involve wholes that are not assembled from separates. But structural correspondence is not full explanation — the transition from physical holism to phenomenal holism remains the hard problem. The quantum approach identifies the right *kind* of physical substrate and a locus where consciousness might participate (at collapse), while acknowledging that the hard problem persists.

### Unity as Primitive

A third approach: treat phenomenal unity as metaphysically basic rather than derived from non-unified elements. If unity is fundamental to consciousness — if it is what makes something an experience rather than a feature added to experience — then BP2 is not a problem to be solved by finding the right mechanism. It is a feature of what consciousness *is*.

On this view, neural binding mechanisms (BP1) condition *which* experiential contents are unified — what gets bound together — while unity itself is contributed by consciousness. This explains the persistent BP1/BP2 gap: neuroscience keeps solving coordination problems without touching phenomenal unity because coordination and unity are different in kind. See [binding-problem](/concepts/binding-problem/) for extended discussion.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The binding problem — treated systematically as a family rather than a single puzzle — illuminates why the Map's [tenets](/tenets/) take the positions they do.

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: The shared structure across all five binding varieties reveals that phenomenal unity is irreducible to physical coordination. The same explanatory gap appears in perception, time, cognition, and subjecthood. No arrangement of separate physical processes — no matter how tightly coordinated — produces genuine experiential unity. This supports the core dualist claim: consciousness involves something beyond the physical.

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)**: If quantum entanglement is the only physics providing genuine holism, the binding problem motivates the tenet directly. Classical physics can coordinate separates; only quantum mechanics can produce genuine wholes. The binding problem's resistance to classical solution is consistent with consciousness operating at the quantum level.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)**: Binding is not passive. Attention shapes what gets bound — you can attend to visual features and ignore auditory input, or vice versa. If consciousness merely reflected neural binding passively, voluntary control of binding would be inexplicable. The fact that [effortful attention](/concepts/mental-effort/) shapes which streams unify suggests top-down causation from phenomenal states to neural coordination. This connects to [free will](/topics/free-will/): if phenomenal binding is partly under voluntary control, consciousness actively selects among possible unified experiences rather than passively registering whatever the brain presents.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)**: The systematicity of binding — the fact that *this* particular configuration of contents is unified in *this* particular way — requires real collapse. In many-worlds, every possible binding occurs in parallel branches. The phenomenological fact that I am experiencing *this* unified configuration, and not another, requires that one configuration was selected as actual. Many-worlds removes the selection that binding seems to require.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)**: Five varieties of the same gap is not five coincidences — it is a pattern. The temptation is to assume that explaining BP1 in each domain will automatically explain BP2. But the systematicity of the failure suggests that the gap is principled, not a matter of insufficient progress. Apparent simplicity (just solve the coordination problem) conceals genuine complexity (unity is not coordination).
