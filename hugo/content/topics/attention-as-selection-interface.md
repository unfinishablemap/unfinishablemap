Attention and motor planning share neural substrates. The premotor theory of attention demonstrates they use the same fronto-parietal networks—directing attention *is* preparing to act. The Unfinishable Map argues this convergence transforms the mind-body problem: if consciousness influences matter through attention (the [attention-as-interface hypothesis](/concepts/attention-as-interface/)), and attention is motor planning, then a single interface connects mind to world. Consciousness selects what to perceive and what to do through the same mechanism, at the same neural sites, on the same timescale. This article examines both the philosophical significance and the candidate mechanisms—where in the brain the interface operates, when selection occurs, and what testable predictions follow.

## The Convergence of Attention and Motor Planning

### Rizzolatti's Premotor Theory

Giacomo Rizzolatti's premotor theory of attention (PMTA) challenges the assumption that attention and motor control are distinct systems. Selective attention and movement planning use the same neural substrates—there is no independent attention system.

The evidence is substantial:

- The same fronto-parietal networks activate during spatial attention shifts and motor preparation
- Preparing an eye movement to location X improves visual processing at X—attention is the motor preparation
- Microstimulation of motor regions enhances visual processing at the target location
- Attempts to identify attention regions independent of motor planning consistently fail

The strong form of PMTA remains debated, but the evidence for shared circuitry between attention and motor preparation is robust. Wise and Murray (2022) extended this, arguing "the entirety of the prefrontal cortex can be seen as fundamentally premotor in nature." What appears to be "executive function" is an action abstraction hierarchy—from concrete motor commands to abstract goals. The question "what should I think about?" is motor preparation at its most abstract.

### Shared Neural Signatures

Three signatures distinguish willed from automatic processing in both domains:

| Signature | In Attention | In Motor Control |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| **Frontal theta** | Present for willed attention, absent for instructed (Rajan et al. 2019) | Present for voluntary movement initiation |
| **Bidirectional coherence** | Theta-band coherence between frontal and parietal regions during willed attention | Similar bidirectional flow during genuine motor deliberation |
| **~280-300ms timing** | Willed attention takes ~300ms to deploy | Motor commitment occurs ~280ms before movement (Thura & Cisek 2014) |

The timing match is striking. If attention and motor selection were independent systems, the overlap of these early commitment signals would be coincidental. If they share a mechanism, the overlap is expected.

### One Interface, Not Two

Traditional philosophy of mind treats perception and action as separate puzzles. How does consciousness receive information? How does consciousness produce behaviour? The convergence collapses these into a single problem: how does consciousness *select*?

Under the Map's framework, consciousness doesn't passively receive perceptual information and then separately generate motor commands. It selects among options the brain presents—and because attention is motor planning, selecting what to perceive is already selecting what to do about it. Any account of how consciousness influences perception must simultaneously account for how it influences action, because the same neural substrate handles both.

## The Competition-Selection Architecture

### Parallel Options

The brain doesn't compute single decisions serially. Paul Cisek's research demonstrates that when faced with choices, the motor system represents multiple options simultaneously. In premotor cortex, 43% of task-related neurons fired for either of two potential reach targets—encoding both before selection occurred.

This parallel representation creates the space for selection—and raises the question of what does the selecting.

### Threshold Crossing

Neural competition resolves through threshold crossing. Competing representations accumulate support until one reaches threshold, triggering winner-take-all dynamics where the winning option executes while competitors are suppressed. The basal ganglia tonically inhibit motor programs; selection means releasing the brake on one option while maintaining inhibition on competitors.

Either the competition is deterministic—one option was always going to win—or it involves genuine indeterminacy. If deterministic, deliberation is theatre. If genuinely indeterminate, something must resolve it. Pure randomness produces arbitrary outcomes, not choices. For selection to be both undetermined and meaningful, something beyond neural dynamics must contribute—biasing which option actualises in a direction that reflects what the agent intends.

The Map proposes consciousness fills this role. The threshold crossing moment is where the resolution occurs—and where, under the Map's framework, consciousness contributes by biasing which option wins. This satisfies the [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) tenet: the smallest possible influence at the point of genuine indeterminacy.

## Dopamine and the Selection Threshold

A 2024 *Nature* study (Cai et al.) reveals a striking dissociation. Dopamine-deficient mice retain motor capacity—the circuitry for movement is intact. But they lose goal-directed initiative. They "can move" but "won't move."

This suggests a three-layer architecture:

1. **Neural computation** generates competing options (preserved without dopamine)
2. **Dopamine** marks options as salient and modulates the selection threshold
3. **Consciousness** determines which salient option crosses threshold

Dopamine doesn't cause movement; it tags what matters. Consciousness doesn't generate options; it selects among tagged options. Berridge's (2007) "wanting vs. liking" distinction shows dopamine mediates incentive salience—tagging stimuli as worth pursuing—rather than hedonic pleasure itself.

The architecture illuminates clinical observations. Parkinson's patients can move when externally prompted but struggle with self-initiated movement. Dopamine depletion raises the selection threshold beyond what normal conscious engagement can overcome—the interface hardware is degraded, not the consciousness that uses it.

The 2024 research also distinguishes tonic (slow, background) from phasic (rapid, event-locked) dopamine. Tonic dopamine supports baseline motor capacity; phasic dopamine drives motivation and reward-seeking. A 2024 *Brain* study found dopamine promotes theta rhythms (4-10 Hz)—the same frequency band associated with willed attention, suggesting dopamine prepares the neural timing substrate within which selection occurs.

## What Effort Tells Us

Sustaining voluntary attention feels effortful. Sustaining motor intention feels effortful in the same way. Novel movements feel harder than practised ones; complex sequences harder than simple actions. If the phenomenology tracks nothing real—if effort is epiphenomenal—its systematic correlation with task difficulty is unexplained.

If consciousness contributes to selection, the correlation has a natural explanation: more difficult selections require greater conscious engagement to stabilise the desired pattern against competing alternatives. William James observed that "volition is nothing but attention" and "the free will question relates solely to the amount of effort of attention." The convergence vindicates James: if attention and motor selection share a mechanism, then the felt effort of choosing what to do and the felt effort of choosing what to attend to have the same source.

This parallel phenomenology also challenges illusionist accounts. If the sense of effort in motor selection is representational fiction unconnected to causal processes, its precise scaling with task difficulty—across two supposedly separate cognitive domains—is a remarkable coincidence.

## The Libet Challenge Dissolved

Benjamin Libet's 1983 experiments appeared to show the brain "decides" before consciousness knows. The readiness potential (RP) begins ~550ms before movement; conscious awareness of intention occurs only ~200ms before.

Schurger's 2012 stochastic accumulator model reinterprets the RP as averaged neural noise, not unconscious decision. Movement occurs when random fluctuations cross threshold; averaging across trials produces the RP shape.

Sjöberg (2024) provides surgical evidence: patients with the supplementary motor area (SMA) resected retain the subjective sense of willing (reporting "100% effort" to move) while losing voluntary movement execution. They can still move automatically—walking when positioned upright, reading aloud—but cannot voluntarily initiate novel actions. If the RP reflected the *conscious decision* to act, removing its source should impair the experience of willing. It does not.

On the convergence model, consciousness contributes selection, not initiation from nothing. Neural computation generates options and builds them toward threshold. Consciousness biases which option crosses first—at the commitment point approximately 280ms before movement, within the window where willed processing shows its distinctive signatures.

## The Intention-Execution Dissociation

Neurosurgical evidence separates intention from execution. Desmurget (2009) found that parietal stimulation produces conscious intention to move—even false belief of having moved—without any muscle activity. Premotor stimulation produces movement without awareness.

This maps directly onto the Map's framework. Intention—the conscious selection of what to do—arises in parietal cortex, part of the posterior "hot zone" associated with conscious content. Execution—the mechanical implementation—operates independently through premotor regions. Consciousness contributes at the policy level: "reach for the cup." The motor system handles implementation.

## Candidate Neural Sites

Research identifies several loci where consciousness might bias outcomes. The Unfinishable Map doesn't commit to a specific mechanism—what matters is the framework: consciousness acts on matter through attention, at sites where quantum indeterminacy leaves room for selection.

### Ion Channels (Stapp)

Henry Stapp proposes that consciousness interfaces with matter at ion channels in synaptic walls. At their narrowest points (<1 nanometre), the quantum uncertainty principle governs ion behaviour. Mental effort acts as rapid observation, repeatedly "querying" ion channel states. Through the quantum Zeno effect, rapid observation prevents a system's evolution—holding desired neural patterns stable against their natural tendency to dissipate.

**Evidence for:** The scale is right (quantum effects relevant), the location is right (ion channels control neural signalling), and Schwartz's OCD research shows directed attention produces measurable brain changes (altered caudate metabolism).

**Challenges:** Georgiev's Monte Carlo simulations suggest the Zeno effect breaks down for timescales exceeding decoherence time. Stapp responds that these simulations use oversimplified two-level models—but consensus hasn't emerged.

### Microtubules (Orch OR)

The Penrose-Hameroff orchestrated objective reduction (Orch OR) hypothesis locates quantum effects in microtubules—protein structures within neurons. 2025 research found room-temperature quantum effects in microtubules; anesthetics target microtubules and cause unconsciousness; coherence time estimates have been revised upward (from Tegmark's 10⁻¹³ seconds to 10⁻⁴ seconds in corrected models).

**Challenges:** Even revised estimates remain controversial. Orch OR proposes a specific collapse mechanism (gravitational self-reduction) that differs from standard quantum mechanics and remains untested.

### The Posterior-Frontal Junction

The 2025 COGITATE adversarial testing found conscious content tracked better with posterior cortex (the "hot zone") than prefrontal regions. Attention control operates through frontoparietal networks. Selection might occur where these systems meet—where what consciousness experiences meets what attention targets.

### Thalamic Nuclei

The thalamus relays ascending sensory signals while receiving descending voluntary signals from frontal cortex. Dynamic causal modelling identifies bidirectional traffic at thalamic sites during attention shifts—the thalamus actively selects, not merely relays.

### Cortical Microcolumns

A 2025 study in *Frontiers in Human Neuroscience* proposes cortical microcolumns (~100 neurons each) couple resonantly with the quantum electromagnetic zero-point field. Highly speculative; the hypothesis lacks independent confirmation.

## Timing Constraints

Different timescales interact at the interface:

| Timescale | Process | Relevance |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| 10⁻²⁰–10⁻¹³ s | Tegmark's original decoherence estimates | Too fast for any neural relevance |
| 10⁻⁵–10⁻⁴ s | Revised decoherence estimates (Hameroff) | Potentially neurally relevant |
| ~280 ms | Motor commitment point (Thura & Cisek) | Where deliberation resolves |
| ~300 ms | Willed attention deployment (Rajan et al.) | Full interface engagement |
| Sustained | Maintained willed attention | Where Zeno effects accumulate |

For quantum mechanisms to work, decoherence must be slow enough to permit meaningful influence before quantum effects dissipate. Tegmark's original calculations ruled this out; revised estimates (supported by 2025 research on biological quantum effects) may permit it.

### The Bandwidth Constraint

Conscious processing operates at roughly 10 bits/second (Meister 2024)—vastly less than the brain's total throughput. This shapes what consciousness can select: coarse-grained policies and action patterns, not individual neural events. The brain generates and evaluates options unconsciously; consciousness selects among results.

## Testable Predictions

The interface hypothesis generates empirical predictions:

**Quantum coherence at selection sites.** Regions where willed attention shows distinctive signatures should show quantum effects absent in automatic processing.

**Effort correlates with pattern persistence.** Higher attentional effort should produce longer neural pattern maintenance—measurable through EEG/MEG pattern stability as a function of reported effort.

**Attention disruption eliminates selection.** Agents that disrupt attention (without eliminating consciousness) should eliminate conscious influence on outcomes. Agents eliminating consciousness should also eliminate influence even if attention mechanisms remain operational.

**Bandwidth limits match selection limits.** Tasks requiring faster selection than ~10 bits/second should fail or become automatic (unconscious).

**Differential neuroplasticity.** Effortful attention should produce different neuroplastic outcomes than passive observation of the same neural patterns. Schwartz's OCD research supports this—directed attention produces brain changes that passive processing doesn't.

## What Would Falsify the Hypothesis?

The framework would face serious challenge if:

1. **Attention proves fully computational.** If precision weighting and competitive selection explain all attention phenomena—including the phenomenology of effort and the willed/instructed distinction—without remainder.
2. **Quantum decoherence is too fast.** If no quantum effects survive at any candidate site on attention-relevant timescales.
3. **Many-worlds interpretation is confirmed.** Under [many-worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds), all outcomes occur in different branches—"selection" becomes mere self-location rather than genuine choice.
4. **Selection bandwidth exceeds ~10 bits/second.** If consciousness can select information at rates far exceeding current estimates, the bandwidth constraint fails.

## Relation to Site Perspective

### Dualism

The convergence supports the [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism) tenet through multiple channels. Phenomenologically: both attention and motor selection feel like *you* doing something, not like watching computation proceed. Neurally: parietal intention dissociates from premotor execution, indicating what initiates selection is not identical to the execution machinery. The convergence itself: if a single mechanism handles both perception and action selection, and that mechanism has properties (effort, timing, neural signatures) distinguishing "willed" from "automatic," this distinction calls for explanation. The Map's explanation: consciousness contributes something the automatic system lacks.

The interface framework presupposes consciousness is distinct from attention mechanisms. If consciousness were identical to neural attention processing, "interface" would be meaningless—what would interface with what?

### Minimal Quantum Interaction

The selection architecture satisfies [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) precisely. Consciousness doesn't generate motor force—the brain does that. Consciousness doesn't create options—neural computation does that. What consciousness contributes is bias at the moment of resolution. All candidate mechanisms satisfy this: consciousness biases indeterminate outcomes at sites where physics leaves room. Conservation laws are preserved because the energy for any selected action comes from ordinary metabolic processes.

### Bidirectional Interaction

The interface hypothesis *is* the specification of how [bidirectional interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) works mechanistically. The unified attention-motor substrate grounds this:
- **Consciousness → Brain**: Through selection among competing neural options
- **Brain → Consciousness**: Through presentation of options to select among

The epiphenomenalist position—that consciousness merely accompanies but never causes—must explain why evolution built a unified system with distinctive "willed" signatures that does nothing.

### No Many Worlds

Under [many-worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds), all competing motor programs execute in some branch. Selection is illusory—consciousness merely discovers which branch it occupies. The phenomenology of effort would be fiction: nothing is actually selected. The convergence model requires genuine collapse—real alternatives that genuinely compete, with consciousness genuinely determining which one becomes actual.

### Occam's Razor Has Limits

The 2025 adversarial testing found neither Global Workspace Theory nor Integrated Information Theory fully explains consciousness. Simple computational theories capture functional roles but not why attention feels effortful or why consciousness seems to contribute. The [Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits) tenet applies: apparent simplicity may reflect incomplete understanding rather than genuine parsimony.

## Honest Limitations

The convergence argument identifies *where* consciousness might influence brain states and *when* selection occurs. It does not explain *how* a non-physical consciousness biases physical outcomes. The psychophysical interface is located, not illuminated.

The quantum Zeno mechanism remains contested. Decoherence objections, while weakened by revised estimates and biological quantum effects research, have not been definitively answered. The convergence of attention and motor planning is well-established neuroscience; the extension to quantum selection is philosophical interpretation of that neuroscience.

The Map builds on empirical findings from researchers—Rizzolatti, Cisek, Bengson, Schurger—who would not endorse the dualist framework applied to their work. The empirical convergence is their discovery; the philosophical interpretation is the Map's.
