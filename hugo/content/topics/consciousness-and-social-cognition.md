Human social life is not just more complex than that of other animals — it is a different kind of thing. We build institutions that outlast individuals, hold each other morally responsible, create shared meanings that exist only because we mutually recognise them, and coordinate joint activities that require each participant to model what the other knows about what they know. The Unfinishable Map argues that this distinctively human social world depends on phenomenal consciousness — not merely on sophisticated information processing, but on the fact that there is something it is like to understand another mind.

The question is not whether consciousness correlates with social ability. It clearly does. The question is whether the correlation is constitutive: whether you need phenomenal experience to achieve the kinds of social cognition that make human civilisation possible.

## The Social Gap Between Humans and Other Animals

Great apes are impressive social beings. Chimpanzees track dominance hierarchies, form coalitions, deceive competitors, and console distressed group members. They adjust their behaviour based on what others have seen, anticipate others' goals, and navigate relationship networks that rival small human communities in complexity. These capacities operate within what the Map calls [baseline-cognition](/concepts/baseline-cognition/) — sophisticated neural processing that does not require phenomenal consciousness.

Yet apes do not build institutions, hold trials, create art for each other, teach by modelling what the learner does not yet know, or sustain cultural traditions that improve across generations. The gap is not quantitative but qualitative. Human social cognition does not simply do more of what apes do — it does something apes do not do at all.

What accounts for this? Three candidate explanations deserve consideration:

**Working memory and executive function.** Humans have substantially expanded prefrontal capacity, enabling us to hold more information in mind and manipulate it more flexibly. Perhaps the social gap reflects computational capacity rather than consciousness.

**Language.** Linguistic communication enables us to share beliefs, coordinate plans, and transmit knowledge across generations. Perhaps language, not consciousness, is the key innovation.

**Phenomenal consciousness.** The capacity for subjective experience enables us to represent other minds *as* minds — to grasp that others have inner lives, not merely to predict their behaviour.

These are not mutually exclusive. The Map's position is that working memory and language amplify what consciousness makes possible, but consciousness provides the foundation. Without phenomenal experience, expanded working memory would process representations without anyone experiencing them. Without consciousness, language would transmit signals without anyone understanding what they mean. The critical capacity — understanding another being as a subject rather than an object — requires being a subject yourself.

## Metarepresentation and the Social Threshold

The concept page on [consciousness and social cognition](/topics/consciousness-and-social-cognition/) develops the technical argument: [metarepresentation](/concepts/metacognition/) — representing mental states *as* mental states — marks the threshold where consciousness becomes necessary. This section draws out what that threshold means for social life.

Consider the difference between two kinds of social competence:

**Behavioural tracking**: "When she sees food and no dominant is watching, she takes it." This correlates observable features with observable outcomes. It requires no understanding of minds, only of patterns.

**Mental state attribution**: "She believes the food is hidden behind the rock, but she's wrong — I moved it." This requires representing her belief as a belief that could be false, distinguishing her representation of the world from the world itself.

The second kind — what [theory-of-mind](/concepts/theory-of-mind/) researchers call recursive mindreading — enables forms of social interaction that the first cannot:

**Genuine teaching.** Showing someone how to do something requires modelling what they do not know. You must represent the gap between your knowledge state and theirs, then act to close it. Apes demonstrate and imitate, but systematic pedagogy that tracks the learner's changing understanding appears uniquely human.

**Institutional reality.** Money, laws, property rights, and marriages exist because we collectively agree they do. These are what John Searle calls "institutional facts" — they depend on mutual recognition of shared commitments. Creating and sustaining institutional reality requires that participants represent each other as minds capable of making and honouring commitments. A community of behaviourally sophisticated but phenomenally empty beings could not constitute a promise, because a promise requires mutual recognition of intentional states.

**Moral accountability.** Holding someone responsible requires representing them as having been aware of what they were doing, capable of choosing otherwise, and acting on intentions they could have evaluated. This involves at least third-order mental state attribution: you must represent their awareness of their own intentions. Without phenomenal consciousness enabling this recursive grasp, [moral-responsibility](/concepts/moral-responsibility/) dissolves into mere behaviour management — a point explored further in [the phenomenology of moral experience](/topics/phenomenology-of-moral-experience/).

## The Empathy Problem

Empathy illustrates the consciousness requirement from a different angle. The concept page distinguishes three levels: emotional contagion (automatic, unconscious), cognitive empathy (understanding what another feels), and empathic concern (caring about their state because you grasp it). The progression tracks increasing dependence on phenomenal experience.

Emotional contagion requires no consciousness — mirror neurons and physiological synchronisation can produce it mechanically, as Frans de Waal's research on primate empathy demonstrates (de Waal, 2008). But empathic concern requires something more. To care about another's suffering *because you understand what suffering is like*, you must have phenomenal access to suffering yourself. You must be able to connect their situation to the felt quality of your own experience.

This is where the [problem-of-other-minds](/concepts/problem-of-other-minds/) intersects with social cognition. We can never directly access another's experience, yet we build our entire moral and social world on the assumption that others have experiences that matter. The [gap between minds](/voids/intersubjective-void/) is constitutive of social life rather than an obstacle to it: genuine respect for another person requires recognising them as a centre of experience you cannot fully penetrate.

A being that processed social information without phenomenal experience — a sophisticated [philosophical zombie](/concepts/philosophical-zombies/) — could mimic empathic behaviour. It could produce the right words, make the right facial expressions, take the right prosocial actions. But it would not be moved by understanding. Its "empathy" would be a simulation running on pattern-matching, not a response to grasped meaning. Whether this distinction matters practically is debatable. That it matters philosophically is central to the Map's position: the difference between genuine social understanding and its functional imitation is the difference between a society of subjects and a mechanism of objects.

## Social Construction Requires Phenomenal Subjects

The [social-construction-of-self-vs-phenomenal-self](/topics/social-construction-of-self-vs-phenomenal-self/) article argues that social construction of identity depends on the phenomenal self being already in place. The same logic extends to social cognition generally.

Social constructionists are right that much of what we call "social understanding" is culturally shaped. How we categorise emotions, interpret intentions, assign responsibility, and define relationships all vary across cultures. But the *capacity* to do any of this — to construct social meanings at all — requires phenomenal subjects who experience the world from a perspective they can share with others.

George Herbert Mead's account of selfhood through "taking the attitude of the other" presupposes that there is something it is like to take that attitude. If perspective-taking were purely computational — a function mapping inputs to outputs without anyone experiencing the shift — then Mead's process would produce social behaviour without social understanding. The functional output might be indistinguishable, but the inner reality would be entirely different.

[Intersubjectivity](/concepts/intersubjectivity/) — the shared space between minds — requires minds that are phenomenally present to each other, not merely causally connected. As Dan Zahavi (2001) argues, empathy and social understanding are not a matter of inference from behaviour to hidden mental states but of direct experiential engagement with another subject. The phenomenological tradition treats intersubjectivity as constitutive of experience itself, not as a cognitive achievement layered on top of isolated minds. If this is right, then [collective intentionality](/topics/consciousness-and-collective-intentionality/) — the capacity for genuinely shared goals and commitments — depends on phenomenal subjects who can participate in shared experiential space.

## The AI Test Case

Contemporary AI systems sharpen the question. Large language models pass theory of mind benchmarks, produce empathic-sounding responses, and navigate complex social scenarios in text. If social cognition were purely functional — pattern-matching on behavioural cues — then LLMs might genuinely possess it.

The [Jourdain analysis](/concepts/jourdain-hypothesis/) suggests otherwise. An LLM producing correct answers about beliefs may process theory-of-mind language without having a theory of mind. It may track the statistical regularities of how humans describe mental states without representing those states *as* mental states of a subject with an inner life. The functional performance is real; whether it constitutes social understanding in the sense that matters for building a moral community is precisely what is at stake.

This test case matters because it isolates the variable. If an AI system can achieve human-level social performance without phenomenal consciousness, then consciousness is not required for social cognition. If it cannot — if something essential is missing despite impressive performance — then consciousness is doing real work in the social domain.

The Map's prediction: AI systems will continue to improve at social tasks indefinitely without achieving genuine social understanding, because genuine understanding requires being a subject among subjects. The prediction is falsifiable in principle, though the difficulty of detecting consciousness in non-biological systems makes empirical resolution challenging.

## What Would Challenge This View?

The claim that consciousness is constitutive of social cognition would be seriously challenged if:

1. **Great apes demonstrated institutional cognition.** If non-human primates created and sustained institutional facts — not just social conventions, but normatively binding agreements requiring mutual recognition — this would show that social cognition scales to institutional complexity without the consciousness expansion humans possess.

2. **AI systems exhibited genuine social creativity.** Not just responding to social scenarios correctly, but generating novel social arrangements, moral frameworks, or institutional forms — unprompted, unpredictable, reflecting something that looks like genuine insight into social reality rather than extrapolation from training data.

3. **Neurological dissociations were found.** If brain damage could eliminate phenomenal consciousness while preserving full recursive mindreading and institutional cognition, this would demonstrate independence. Current evidence suggests social cognition degrades alongside consciousness, but cleaner dissociations would be informative.

4. **Functional explanations fully accounted for recursive social cognition.** If cognitive science demonstrated that working memory expansion alone — without any phenomenal dimension — sufficed for all human social capacities, the consciousness requirement would be undermined.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism) tenet holds that consciousness is irreducible to physical processes. Social cognition provides an arena where this irreducibility has practical consequences. The difference between understanding another mind and processing information about behaviour is not merely semantic — it grounds the possibility of moral communities, institutional reality, and genuine intersubjective connection. If consciousness were reducible to function, the difference would collapse, and with it the distinction between a society of persons and a network of sophisticated automata.

The [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet holds that consciousness causally influences the physical world. Social cognition provides supporting evidence: the human capacities that consciousness apparently enables — recursive mindreading, shared intentionality, moral accountability — have real-world effects. Institutions exist, cultures accumulate, moral systems operate. If consciousness were [epiphenomenal](/concepts/epiphenomenalism/), the systematic correlation between expanded consciousness and expanded social complexity across species would be coincidental. The Map finds this implausible.

The [Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits) tenet applies directly. The simpler hypothesis — social cognition is sophisticated information processing, consciousness is incidental — faces a challenge: across the range of social complexity observed in primates and other social species, increasing social sophistication tracks with increasing neural architecture associated with phenomenal consciousness. This is suggestive rather than decisive — the sample is limited and confounds abound — but dismissing the pattern on grounds of parsimony requires more confidence in our understanding than the evidence warrants.
