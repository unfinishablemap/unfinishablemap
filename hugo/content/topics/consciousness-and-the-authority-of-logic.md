Logical laws do not merely describe patterns in how people reason. They *compel*. When you grasp that if all mammals are warm-blooded and whales are mammals, then whales are warm-blooded, you do not experience this as one option among many. You experience it as something you *must* accept — as binding in a way that physical regularities are not. The Unfinishable Map argues that this binding force, this authority that logical laws exercise over thought, depends on consciousness in ways that physicalism cannot accommodate.

This is a narrower claim than the [argument-from-reason](/topics/argument-from-reason/), which targets whether physicalism is self-defeating. It is also more specific than [consciousness-and-normative-authority](/topics/consciousness-and-normative-authority/), which examines normative force across moral, epistemic, and aesthetic domains. The question here is pointed: what gives logic its peculiar grip, and what does that grip reveal about consciousness?

## The Compulsion of Validity

Consider modus ponens: if P, then Q; P; therefore Q. This inference rule does not describe a tendency. It does not say that people *usually* draw this conclusion, or that drawing it is *adaptive*. It says the conclusion *follows* — that denying the conclusion while affirming the premises is not merely unusual but *wrong*.

Where does this wrongness come from? Physical laws describe regularities: masses attract, charges repel. These regularities hold without compelling anyone to acknowledge them. A rock obeys gravity without recognising that it must. But logical necessity is different. It is experienced from inside. When you follow an argument and reach the point where the conclusion becomes unavoidable, something happens phenomenally — a sense of being *bound*, of having no rational alternative.

This phenomenal dimension is crucial. A computer executes modus ponens without experiencing compulsion. It transitions between states according to its programming. Nothing in the transition has the character of necessity *grasped as such*. The output matches what logic demands, but the machine does not encounter logic's demand.

## Logical Necessity as Phenomenal

The [cognitive phenomenology](/concepts/cognitive-phenomenology/) debate asks whether thinking has its own "what it's like" beyond sensory accompaniments. The authority of logic provides a strong case that it does.

When you grasp a valid deduction, there is a distinctive phenomenal quality — not the warmth of understanding a narrative or the satisfaction of solving a puzzle, but the cold clarity of seeing that *this must be so*. Mathematicians report this as the difference between checking steps mechanically and *seeing why* a proof works. The [mathematical understanding](/topics/consciousness-and-mathematical-understanding/) case makes this vivid: verification follows rules; understanding grasps necessity.

This phenomenal character of logical necessity has several distinctive features:

**Modality.** The experience is not just that the conclusion *is* true but that it *must be* true — that no possible situation could make the premises true while the conclusion is false. This modal character is experiential: you feel the impossibility of the alternative.

**Impersonality.** Unlike moral compulsion, which can feel like a demand addressed to *you*, logical compulsion feels independent of the reasoner. The validity of modus ponens does not depend on who is reasoning. This impersonal quality is itself phenomenally marked — a sense of encountering something that would hold regardless of anyone's opinion.

**Transparency.** In paradigm cases, you do not merely believe the conclusion follows — you *see* that it does. The connection between premises and conclusion is transparent to consciousness. This transparency distinguishes logical grasp from other forms of justified belief. You can believe something on testimony without seeing why it is true. You cannot grasp a valid deduction without seeing the connection.

## Why Physical Processes Cannot Ground Logical Authority

Physical causation operates through efficient causes — one state producing another according to natural law. Neural firing patterns cause subsequent neural firing patterns through electrochemical mechanisms. But logical authority is not efficient causation. The premises do not *cause* the conclusion the way a billiard ball causes another to move. The premises *entail* the conclusion — a relationship that holds timelessly and necessarily, not as a causal transaction between events.

This creates a fundamental problem for physicalism. If your transition from premises to conclusion is fully explained by neural causation, then the logical relationship between the propositions plays no role in producing your belief. The neurons that encode your conclusion were caused by the neurons encoding your premises, but the *logical* connection between the propositions was explanatorily idle. You would have drawn the same conclusion — or a different one — depending on neural wiring, regardless of whether the argument was valid.

The physicalist might respond that evolution has wired our brains to track logical relationships. But this response confuses correlation with authority. Even if neural processes reliably produce outputs matching valid inferences, reliability is not the same as being *bound* by logical necessity. A thermostat reliably tracks temperature without being compelled by thermodynamic laws. The felt compulsion of logic — the experience of *having no rational alternative* — is something over and above reliable tracking.

## The Sellarsian Gap Revisited

Wilfrid Sellars distinguished the "space of reasons" from the "space of causes." The [argument-from-reason](/topics/argument-from-reason/) exploits this distinction to challenge physicalism generally. But the authority of logic reveals a specific dimension that broader normative arguments can overlook.

Moral norms might conceivably be explained as social constructions or evolutionary adaptations (though the Map rejects such reductions). Logical norms resist these explanations more stubbornly. The claim that modus ponens is culturally constructed is incoherent — any culture that rejected it would be unable to reason at all, including about whether to reject it. The claim that it is an evolutionary adaptation reduces necessity to contingent usefulness, which is precisely what logical authority is not.

Logic's authority is *presupposed* by any attempt to explain it. Any explanation must itself employ logical principles. Any argument against the authority of logic uses logical authority to make its case. This self-involving character sets logical normativity apart from other normative domains. Moral authority can be questioned without using morality. Logical authority cannot be questioned without using logic.

## Consciousness as the Site of Logical Authority

If logical authority cannot be grounded in physical causation, social construction, or evolutionary contingency, where does it reside? The Map's answer: in consciousness.

This is not the vague claim that consciousness is somehow "involved" in logic. It is the specific claim that the binding force of logical laws exists only for conscious beings who can *grasp* logical relationships as necessary. Logical authority has its home in the phenomenal experience of seeing that a conclusion must follow — in [cognitive-phenomenology](/concepts/cognitive-phenomenology/) as the medium through which necessity becomes manifest.

Three considerations support this:

**Grasping versus computing.** A system that computes valid inferences without consciousness implements logic but is not bound by it. The system has no experience of necessity, no phenomenal encounter with the must-be-so. Logical authority — as distinguished from logical implementation — requires a subject who encounters it.

**The reflexivity of logical awareness.** When you recognise that modus ponens is valid, you do not merely apply it — you *appreciate its validity*. This appreciation is a conscious act directed at the logical relationship itself. You see not just that the conclusion follows but *that it follows necessarily*. This second-order awareness — awareness of the necessity of the connection — is distinctively conscious.

**The phenomenology of error.** When you catch a logical mistake, the experience has a specific quality: the jarring recognition that something was wrong, the sense that you *should have* drawn a different conclusion. This normative phenomenology — the felt wrongness of the error — is evidence that logical authority operates through consciousness. A system that merely revises outputs when they fail to match valid patterns has no phenomenal experience of error.

## The Challenge from Formal Logic

One might object that formal logic is precisely the attempt to make logical validity independent of consciousness. Formal systems specify axioms and rules of inference that determine validity mechanically, without any appeal to intuition or phenomenal experience. Doesn't this show that logic's authority is formal, not phenomenal?

The Map's response: formal systems capture the *structure* of logical relationships but not their *authority*. A formal system tells you that Q follows from P and P→Q. It does not tell you why you *ought* to accept Q given P and P→Q. The normative force — the reason validity *matters* — is not itself formal. It is experienced by conscious beings who recognise that following valid inference is not merely one option among others.

Kurt Gödel's incompleteness theorems reinforce this point from another direction. No consistent formal system sufficiently powerful to express basic arithmetic can prove its own consistency. Mathematical understanding outstrips formal proof. This suggests that mathematical and logical insight involves something beyond formal manipulation — a conscious grasp of mathematical reality that formal systems cannot fully capture.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The authority of logic provides distinctive support for three of the Map's [tenets](/tenets/):

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: Logical necessity is not a physical property. No arrangement of matter is "necessarily so" in the way that a valid deduction is necessarily truth-preserving. If logical authority is real — if modus ponens genuinely compels — then there are normative facts that physical description cannot capture. Consciousness, as the medium through which these facts become manifest, involves irreducible properties.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)**: The authority of logic is not merely recognised — it is *acted upon*. When you draw a valid conclusion, your recognition of logical necessity influences which belief you form. If this recognition is genuinely conscious (as the [phenomenology of intellectual effort](/topics/phenomenology-of-intellectual-effort/) suggests), then consciousness causally influences belief formation. An epiphenomenal consciousness could experience logical compulsion without that compulsion making any difference to what is believed — a position that is, as the [self-stultification](/concepts/self-stultification/) argument shows, epistemically self-defeating.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)**: Physicalism offers a simpler picture: brains compute, and computation is all there is to logic. But this simplicity purchases incoherence. A theory that cannot account for why logical validity *binds* — that reduces logical compulsion to neural habit — cannot itself be logically justified. The apparent simplicity of eliminating logical authority from one's ontology costs more than it saves.
