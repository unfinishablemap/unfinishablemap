Phenomenal conservatism holds that if it seems to you that something is the case, you have at least prima facie justification for believing it—unless you have specific reasons to doubt. The Unfinishable Map argues that this principle, developed by Michael Huemer as a general epistemological framework, has profound implications for consciousness science. When experience presents itself as qualitative, unified, and irreducible to physical description, phenomenal conservatism says this seeming deserves default trust. The burden shifts to those who deny what experience reports about itself. This reframes the debate between dualists and materialists: the question is not whether introspective evidence can earn its keep, but whether materialists have adequate defeaters for what consciousness seems to be.

## The Principle

Michael Huemer formulates phenomenal conservatism (PC) as follows: if it seems to S that P, then, in the absence of defeaters, S thereby has at least some justification for believing that P. "Seemings" here are a broad category encompassing perceptual experience, memory, introspection, and intellectual intuition. They are not bare inclinations to believe—they have a distinctive phenomenal character, a felt "pushiness" toward their content that distinguishes them from wishes, guesses, or habits.

PC is a principle of *prima facie* justification. Seemings provide default warrant that can be overridden by countervailing evidence. Seeing a stick bent in water provides prima facie justification for thinking the stick is bent; learning about refraction provides a defeater. The justification is real but defeasible.

Huemer's central argument for PC is the self-defeat charge: any alternative epistemological principle must itself seem true to those who hold it. Classical foundationalists who restrict foundational justification to self-evident propositions must find their restriction intuitively compelling—that is, it must *seem* to them that only self-evident propositions deserve foundational status. But this seeming is itself providing justification in exactly the way PC describes. Denying PC while relying on it to justify the denial is self-undermining.

## Seemings About Consciousness

The standard case for PC involves perceptual seemings: the table seems brown, so you have prima facie justification for believing it is brown. But the principle applies equally to introspective seemings—and this is where it intersects with consciousness science.

Consider what experience reports about itself:

**Qualitative character.** Pain does not merely seem to involve tissue-damage detection. It *seems to hurt*—to have an irreducible qualitative feel that no functional description captures. Visual experience does not merely seem to process wavelength information. It *seems coloured*—to present redness, blueness, and their contrasts as features of consciousness itself.

**Unity.** Experience does not seem fragmented into isolated channels. It *seems unified*—visual, auditory, and proprioceptive information bound into a single field of awareness.

**Subjectivity.** Experience does not seem to be a property observable from outside. It *seems perspectival*—anchored in a point of view that cannot be fully captured by any third-person description.

PC says these seemings carry prima facie justificatory weight. The default epistemic position is that experience has the qualitative, unified, subjective character it presents. To deny this—as [illusionism](/concepts/illusionism/) does—requires positive reasons, not mere theoretical preference for parsimony.

## The Burden-Shifting Move

This reframes familiar debates. The traditional framing asks: "Can we *prove* consciousness is irreducible to physical processes?" The PC framing asks: "Do we have adequate *defeaters* for the seeming that consciousness is irreducible?"

The difference matters. Under the traditional framing, dualists bear the burden of establishing their position against a default of physicalism. Under the PC framing, the phenomenal evidence carries default weight, and physicalists must show why that evidence should be overridden.

What would count as a defeater? A successful physicalist reduction: a theory that not only correlates neural activity with experience but explains *why* particular neural patterns produce particular qualitative characters. The [hard problem](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/) persists precisely because no such reduction exists. Neural correlates tell us which brain states accompany which experiences; they do not explain why any brain state produces any experience at all.

Until such a reduction succeeds, PC says the seemings stand. Consciousness seems qualitative, unified, and irreducible. In the absence of defeaters, those seemings justify belief in the reality of what they present.

## Objections and Responses

### Crazy Seemings

Peter Markie objects that PC is too permissive. If a tree seems to have been planted on 24 April 1914—a seeming that comes "completely out of the blue"—PC apparently grants prima facie justification for this bizarre belief. Surely not all seemings should be trusted.

Huemer responds that genuine seemings must be distinguished from mere inclinations to believe. The walnut tree case involves a stray thought, not a genuine appearance with the distinctive phenomenal force that characterises perceptual or introspective seemings. But even granting that some seemingly unmotivated impressions qualify, they are easily defeated by background knowledge. Nobody acts on such impressions because defeaters are immediately available.

For consciousness, this objection has limited force. Introspective seemings about qualitative character are not stray thoughts—they are persistent, universal, cross-culturally stable, and confirmed by training (as the Fox et al. 2012 meditation study demonstrates). They are paradigmatic cases of robust seemings, not marginal ones.

### Cognitive Penetration

Susanna Siegel and Jack Lyons raise the "bad basis" problem: if unjustified beliefs can cause experiences, then those experiences might inherit their sources' irrationality. If Jill irrationally believes Jack is angry, and this belief causes her to see anger in his face, should that perceptual seeming justify the belief that produced it?

This is a real challenge for PC generally. For the consciousness case specifically, however, the relevant seemings are not plausibly produced by prior unjustified beliefs. The seeming that pain hurts is not produced by a background theory about pain. It is produced by pain itself. The seeming that redness looks like *something*—that it has a qualitative character beyond wavelength processing—is not a theoretical inference. It is a direct presentation. Cognitive penetration threatens PC when beliefs distort appearances; it has limited purchase when appearances arise from direct acquaintance with phenomenal states.

### The Introspective Unreliability Challenge

Eric Schwitzgebel argues that introspection is broadly unreliable, even for current phenomenal states. If he is right, introspective seemings may not deserve default trust.

The Map's [introspection](/concepts/introspection/) article addresses this in detail. The key distinction: Schwitzgebel's strongest evidence concerns *peripheral* and *background* phenomenal states—whether experience has a constant visual field, whether peripheral vision is detailed, whether emotions have consistent phenomenal signatures. He is less convincing about *focal* phenomenal states—the qualitative character of attended experience. The process/content distinction (Nisbett and Wilson 1977) helps here: we lack access to cognitive *processes* but retain access to phenomenal *content* under attention.

Brie Gertler's acquaintance approach sharpens this response. When an introspective judgement about experience qualifies as knowledge by acquaintance—when phenomenal reality itself constitutes the epistemic appearance—introspective error of the kind Schwitzgebel documents cannot arise. The subject is not inferring what their experience is like from unreliable cues; they are directly presented with it. This does not make introspection infallible. But it grounds a domain where PC's default trust is especially warranted: attended phenomenal states accessed through direct acquaintance.

### The Metajustification Demand

Ali Hasan and other classical foundationalists argue that PC needs independent justification—a metajustification for trusting seemings. Without one, PC is arbitrarily permissive.

Huemer responds that demanding metajustification leads to infinite regress. Any epistemic principle P requires justification; justifying P requires another principle P', which requires P'', and so on. At some point, an epistemic principle must be accepted without further justification from a more basic principle. PC is a candidate for that foundational role—and it has the advantage that alternatives covertly rely on it anyway, as the self-defeat argument shows.

## What Phenomenal Conservatism Does Not Establish

PC does not prove dualism. It establishes that the seeming irreducibility of consciousness carries default epistemic weight—no more and no less. Several outcomes remain possible:

**A successful physicalist reduction might emerge.** If someone explains why C-fibre firing *is* pain in a way that dissolves the explanatory gap, PC's prima facie justification would be defeated. The seeming of irreducibility would be explained away, as refraction explains the seeming of the bent stick.

**PC-based justification might be outweighed.** Even without a full reduction, strong theoretical considerations might provide partial defeaters. The Map holds that no such considerations currently succeed, but acknowledges this is an ongoing debate.

**The seemings themselves might be more complex than initially described.** Careful phenomenological investigation—of the kind [phenomenological methods](/concepts/phenomenological-evidence/) provide—may reveal that what experience "seems like" is more nuanced than simple irreducibility claims suggest.

What PC rules out is treating the seeming irreducibility of consciousness as *no evidence at all*—as mere intuition to be disregarded whenever it conflicts with theoretical commitments. The physicalist who says "consciousness *seems* irreducible, but that's just a cognitive illusion" owes an explanation of why this particular class of seemings should be dismissed. Saying "parsimony favours physicalism" is not a defeater for a phenomenal seeming; it is a theoretical preference competing with evidence.

## Relation to Site Perspective

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: Phenomenal conservatism provides epistemological grounding for the Map's dualism. The tenet holds that consciousness is not reducible to physical processes. PC explains *why* this position deserves default acceptance: because consciousness presents itself as irreducible, and that presentation carries prima facie justificatory weight. The dualist position is not an exotic hypothesis requiring extraordinary evidence—it is the natural reading of what experience reports about itself.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)**: The standard physicalist appeal to parsimony—"why posit two substances when one suffices?"—amounts to using a theoretical preference to override phenomenal evidence. PC clarifies why this move is epistemically suspect. Parsimony is a theoretical virtue, not a defeater for how things seem. The bent stick *seems* bent; "parsimony says it's straight" is not an adequate response. Similarly, consciousness *seems* irreducible; "parsimony says it's physical" does not defeat the seeming without an independent explanation of why the seeming arises.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)**: Experience presents itself as causally efficacious—willing precedes action, attention modifies experience, reasoning shapes belief. PC grants these seemings default trust. The epiphenomenalist who claims consciousness is causally inert must defeat not only the theoretical arguments for mental causation but also the persistent phenomenal seeming that conscious choices make a difference. The Map's commitment to bidirectional interaction tracks what experience reports about its own causal role.
