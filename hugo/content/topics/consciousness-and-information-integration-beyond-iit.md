[Integrated Information Theory](/concepts/integrated-information-theory/) identified something important: consciousness and integration are intimately connected. Experience is unified—you do not hear the trumpet separately from seeing the performer's fingers move. Information from different sources, modalities, and timescales arrives at a single locus of awareness where it becomes one scene. The Unfinishable Map agrees that integration is central to consciousness. But IIT made a specific philosophical move that does not follow from this observation: it identified consciousness *with* integration, treating them as the same thing. This article argues that integration is better understood as something consciousness *does*—an activity, not an identity—and surveys the alternative frameworks that support this view.

## Why Integration Matters

The importance of integration for consciousness is not controversial. Every major theory of consciousness treats it as either constitutive or necessary:

- IIT says consciousness *is* integrated information
- [Global Workspace Theory](/concepts/global-workspace-theory/) says consciousness arises when information is *broadcast* to an integrated workspace
- [Predictive processing](/concepts/predictive-processing/) frameworks treat consciousness as hierarchical *integration* of predictions and sensory signals
- [Process philosophy](/concepts/process-philosophy/) describes experience as *prehension*—the grasping together of multiple data into unified occasions

The disagreement is not about whether integration matters but about *what kind of thing integration is* and *what role it plays*.

IIT treats integration as constitutive: wherever integrated information (Φ) exists, consciousness exists. The relationship is identity. This is the claim the Map rejects—not because integration is unimportant, but because identity claims leave consciousness with nothing to *do*. If consciousness just *is* the integrated structure, it cannot additionally act on that structure. The [passivity problem](/topics/integrated-information-theory-critique/) follows directly.

## Alternative Frameworks

### Recurrent Processing Theory

Victor Lamme's recurrent processing theory (RPT) locates consciousness not in information integration per se but in recurrent neural processing—signals that loop back from higher cortical areas to lower ones. Feed-forward processing (sensory input travelling up the hierarchy) is unconscious. Consciousness begins when recurrent connections feed information back, creating loops between cortical regions.

RPT shares IIT's emphasis on interconnectedness but differs in a crucial respect: it identifies a *process* rather than a *property*. Recurrence is something the brain *does*, not a static measure of a system at an instant. This temporal dimension addresses one of IIT's weaknesses—the [temporal gap](/topics/consciousness-and-temporal-integration/). Recurrent processing inherently takes time; each loop through the cortical hierarchy has duration. The experienced flow of consciousness maps naturally onto the ongoing recurrent activity rather than requiring an explanation for how instantaneous Φ generates experienced duration.

RPT's limitation from the Map's perspective: it remains a purely neural account. Recurrent processing explains *which* brain states are conscious but not *why* any brain state is conscious at all. The [hard problem](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/) persists. Recurrence could be the physical substrate through which consciousness operates—the neural architecture that provides the right interface—without being identical to consciousness itself.

### Global Workspace Broadcasting

Bernard Baars's Global Workspace Theory (GWT) and its neural implementation by Stanislas Dehaene treat integration differently from IIT. Where IIT measures how tightly a system's parts are bound together, GWT focuses on *availability*: information becomes conscious when it is broadcast from specialised processors to a global workspace accessible to multiple cognitive systems—memory, planning, language, motor control.

On this view, integration is not about internal structure but about *reach*. A percept is integrated into consciousness when it becomes available to the whole cognitive system. This is closer to integration as an activity: the brain actively broadcasts selected information, making it globally accessible.

GWT has empirical support from studies showing that conscious perception correlates with widespread cortical ignition—a sudden cascade of activity across distant brain regions. The 2025 COGITATE adversarial collaboration tested GWT against IIT, with mixed results for both theories, confirming that neither has captured the full picture.

The Map finds GWT's emphasis on broadcasting suggestive. If consciousness selects which information gets broadcast—choosing what enters the workspace from the competing signals available—then GWT describes the downstream effect of conscious selection rather than consciousness itself. Broadcasting is what happens *after* consciousness acts, not what consciousness *is*.

### Predictive Integration

[Predictive processing](/topics/predictive-processing-and-the-maps-framework/) offers perhaps the most sophisticated account of neural integration. The brain maintains a hierarchical generative model, constantly predicting incoming sensory data. Integration occurs when predictions from multiple levels and modalities are reconciled—when prediction errors are minimised and the system arrives at a coherent interpretation of the world.

This kind of integration is inherently active. It involves ongoing inference: the brain tests hypotheses, weighs competing interpretations, and settles on the most likely explanation. The predictive hierarchy generates multiple competing options at every level, creating exactly the landscape of possibilities that a selecting consciousness needs.

Karl Friston's free energy principle formalises this as the minimisation of surprise. But minimising surprise is a description of what the neural system does computationally. The question remains: who or what adjudicates when the system must choose between competing hypotheses of similar probability? Predictive processing provides the machinery; it does not explain what uses the machinery. The Map proposes that consciousness is the user.

### Process-Philosophical Prehension

Alfred North Whitehead's concept of *prehension*—an actual occasion's grasping together of prior data into a new unity of experience—offers a metaphysical framework for integration that predates IIT by nearly a century. For Whitehead, every moment of experience integrates its antecedents: the just-past experience, the sensory data, the contextual history. This integration is not a computation performed on inert data. It is the fundamental act of becoming.

Whitehead's framework treats integration as ontologically basic—not a property to be measured but the very process by which reality advances. Each actual occasion *is* its integration of the previous world into something new. This avoids IIT's passivity problem: integration is not a static property of a structure but a dynamic achievement of a subject.

The limitation: Whitehead's panexperientialism attributes experience to all actual occasions, not just those in brains. The Map does not commit to universal experience but finds Whitehead's insight valuable: integration is a process, not a property, and it is something experience *does* rather than something experience *equals*.

## Integration as Activity

These alternative frameworks converge on a view the Map endorses: integration is better understood as an activity of consciousness than as a definition of it.

Consider what happens when you listen to a symphony. You integrate the timbre of violins with the rhythm of percussion, the current phrase with your memory of the theme stated earlier, the sound with the visual scene of the concert hall. This integration is not passive—it requires attention, selection, and active synthesis. You can choose to focus on the violin line, letting the percussion recede, or attend to the rhythmic structure, letting individual timbres blur. The integrated experience you have depends on what you *do* with the information available.

IIT cannot capture this. Φ is calculated from the system's architecture at an instant—it does not change based on what the subject attends to. Two people with identical neural architectures hearing the same symphony would have the same Φ, yet their conscious experiences might differ radically depending on where they direct [attention](/concepts/attention-as-interface/). The integration that matters for consciousness is *selective integration*—the active synthesis of some information rather than other information into a unified experience.

This selective character is precisely what the Map's framework predicts. If consciousness operates by biasing quantum indeterminacies in neural systems, then the act of integration involves consciousness selecting which neural patterns become actual from among the possibilities the brain presents. Integration is the trace that conscious selection leaves on neural activity—not a precondition for consciousness but a consequence of it.

## The Binding Problem Revisited

The [binding problem](/concepts/binding-problem/)—how distributed neural processing produces unified experience—looks different depending on whether integration is treated as identity or activity.

IIT claims to dissolve the binding problem: if consciousness *is* integration, then asking how integration produces consciousness is a category error. But this dissolution is unsatisfying. We can still ask *why* integrated information should be conscious. The binding problem reappears as the question of why Φ feels like anything.

If integration is an activity of consciousness, the binding problem has a different shape. The question becomes: how does consciousness access distributed neural information and synthesise it into unified experience? This is still difficult, but it is a question about mechanism rather than metaphysics. The Map's answer points to quantum-mediated selection: consciousness accesses the global state of neural possibilities (presented through the brain's recurrent and predictive architecture) and selects a coherent pattern from among them. Binding is achieved through selection—the chosen pattern is unified because a single act of selection produced it.

This reframing explains why binding breaks down in specific neurological conditions. In [simultanagnosia](/concepts/binding-problem/), patients can perceive individual objects but cannot integrate them into a unified scene. On IIT's view, this should reflect reduced Φ. On the Map's view, it reflects damage to the neural architecture that presents options to consciousness—the selection mechanism is intact, but the options it receives are impoverished.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The Map's tenets support treating integration as activity rather than identity.

The **Dualism** tenet holds that consciousness is not reducible to physical processes. If integration is a physical property (as IIT claims), and consciousness is identical to integration, then consciousness reduces to a physical property—contradicting dualism. But if integration is something consciousness *does* through physical systems, dualism is preserved: the physical systems provide the substrate, consciousness provides the integrative act.

**Bidirectional Interaction** requires that consciousness causally influence the physical world. An identity thesis (consciousness *is* integration) leaves no room for influence—the structure simply *is* what it is. An activity thesis (consciousness *integrates*) naturally accommodates causal influence: the act of integration shapes which neural patterns are realised.

**Minimal Quantum Interaction** provides the mechanism. The brain's predictive and recurrent architecture generates a landscape of possible neural states. Consciousness selects among these possibilities at quantum decision points, and the selected pattern is the integrated experience. The integration is quantum-mediated, minimal, and genuinely causal.

**Occam's Razor Has Limits** applies to the temptation to identify consciousness with integration because the identity seems simpler than positing a separate integrating agent. But as IIT's difficulties show—the passivity problem, the expander graph problem, the temporal gap—the apparently simpler identification creates problems that the slightly more complex activity thesis avoids.
