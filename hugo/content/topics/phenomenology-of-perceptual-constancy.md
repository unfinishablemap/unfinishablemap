The Unfinishable Map explores perceptual constancy—the phenomenon whereby objects appear stable in colour, shape, and size despite radical changes in the sensory signals reaching our eyes. A white wall looks white under candlelight, fluorescent tubes, and noon sun, though the wavelengths reflected differ enormously. A dinner plate looks circular whether viewed head-on or at a steep angle. This stability is so fundamental to ordinary experience that it goes unnoticed, yet it conceals one of the deepest puzzles in the philosophy of perception: the constancy we experience cannot be found in the physical signal itself. Something beyond sensory input holds the world steady.

## What Perceptual Constancy Is

Perceptual constancy refers to the tendency of conscious experience to represent objects as possessing stable properties—colour, shape, size, brightness, pitch—even as the proximal sensory stimulation varies dramatically. Psychophysics has catalogued the major forms:

- **Colour constancy.** A banana appears yellow under daylight, incandescent light, and green-tinted shade. The wavelength composition reaching the eye changes by orders of magnitude, yet the experienced colour remains largely the same.
- **Size constancy.** A person walking away projects a shrinking retinal image, yet does not appear to shrink. The experienced size tracks the distal object, not the proximal stimulus.
- **Shape constancy.** A rectangular door swinging open projects a trapezoid onto the retina, but is experienced as rectangular throughout.
- **Lightness constancy.** A piece of coal in sunlight reflects more light than white paper in shadow, yet coal looks dark and paper looks bright.

These constancies are not occasional corrections. They are the default character of perception. Seeing *without* constancy—attending to raw proximal qualities—requires deliberate effort and training, as painters and phenomenologists know.

## The Computational Account and Its Limits

Cognitive science offers computational explanations of constancy. Colour constancy, for instance, is modelled through chromatic adaptation, illuminant estimation, and relational processing—the visual system infers the illuminant and discounts it. Land's retinex theory, Bayesian accounts, and neural adaptation mechanisms all contribute to understanding how the brain computes stable representations from variable input.

These accounts are genuinely informative. They explain *which information* the visual system uses and *how* it transforms retinal signals into stable percepts. The Map does not dispute their empirical findings.

But the computational account stops at the threshold of the [hard problem](/concepts/phenomenal-consciousness/). It explains how the brain arrives at a representation labelled "yellow" across illumination changes—it does not explain why there is *something it is like* to experience that stable yellow. The constancy in question is not merely a computational output. It is a feature of conscious experience: the banana's yellowness *feels* the same under candlelight as under noon sun, and this felt sameness is the phenomenon that needs explaining.

Consider an analogy. A thermostat maintains temperature constancy in a building. It senses, computes, and adjusts. No one supposes there is something it is like to be a thermostat achieving constancy. The computational account of colour constancy describes mechanisms analogous to the thermostat's—sensors, algorithms, outputs. What it cannot account for is that perceptual constancy is experienced from a first-person point of view. The stability is not just computed; it is *undergone*.

## Constancy as Evidence for Irreducible Phenomenality

Perceptual constancy reveals something important about the structure of [qualia](/concepts/qualia/). If qualia were simply identical with sensory transduction states—patterns of cone activation, say—then qualia should vary whenever the proximal stimulus varies. Under candlelight, the yellow-quale should differ from the noon-sun yellow-quale, because the cone activation patterns differ substantially. Yet the experienced quality remains stable.

This means one of two things. Either qualia track something other than proximal sensory states, or qualia are constituted by something that can remain stable across variable physical inputs. Both options resist straightforward physicalist reduction.

The functionalist might respond that qualia are identical with functional roles, and constancy mechanisms ensure those roles stay stable. But this faces the standard [inverted-qualia](/concepts/inverted-qualia/) challenge: two systems could implement identical constancy functions yet differ in what yellow *feels like*. The functional role of "stable colour representation" does not determine its qualitative character. Perceptual constancy sharpens this point—the very mechanism that makes colour experience stable across conditions could operate identically while supporting different phenomenal qualities.

## The Phenomenological Structure of Constancy

Husserl's [phenomenology](/concepts/phenomenology/) provides tools for analysing constancy from the first-person perspective. In the phenomenological tradition, perception involves not just sensing but *constituting* objects through what Husserl called "noematic" structure—the intentional content through which objects are given to consciousness.

When perceiving a plate from an angle, consciousness constitutes it as circular *through* the trapezoidal presentation. The trapezoid is not corrected or overridden; it is experienced *as* a perspective on circularity. Husserl called this "adumbration" (*Abschattung*)—the object gives itself through partial profiles, and consciousness grasps the invariant object across its varying appearances.

This phenomenological structure matters for the philosophy of mind because it shows that perceptual constancy is not a post-processing correction applied to raw sensory data. The constancy is built into the intentional structure of experience itself. We do not first see a trapezoid and then infer a circle. We see the circle *in* the trapezoid. The experience is unified from the start.

This connects directly to the [binding problem](/concepts/binding-problem/). Constancy requires binding across time—linking successive appearances as presentations of the same object—and across modalities. A coffee mug maintains its identity as you walk around it, despite continuous change in visual profile, lighting, and even tactile feedback if you pick it up. This temporal and cross-modal binding that underlies constancy is itself a phenomenal achievement, not merely a computational one.

## Constancy and Attentional Selection

The Map's treatment of [attention](/topics/structure-of-attention/) is relevant here. Perceptual constancy is not automatic or uniform—it can be disrupted, enhanced, or selectively applied through attentional engagement. Painters learn to "break" colour constancy by attending to proximal qualities rather than distal properties. Meditators report similar shifts: contemplative training can make the normally invisible machinery of constancy partially accessible to introspection.

This selective character suggests that constancy involves an active contribution from consciousness, not merely a passive computational process. If [attention is the interface](/topics/attention-as-selection-interface/) where consciousness selects among competing perceptual options, then perceptual constancy may represent one of its most basic operations: selecting the stable distal interpretation over the fluctuating proximal signal.

The approximately 300-millisecond window for deploying voluntary attention is relevant here. Constancy mechanisms operate faster than this—pre-attentive colour constancy, for instance, occurs within the first 100 milliseconds of visual processing. But the *phenomenal stability* of constancy—the fact that the world does not flicker between constancy and its absence—may involve sustained attentional maintenance of the stable interpretation. The distinction between the speed of the computational mechanism and the continuity of the phenomenal result is itself evidence that the computation and the experience are not identical.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The Unfinishable Map's [tenets](/tenets/) bear directly on perceptual constancy in several ways.

The **dualism** tenet holds that consciousness is not reducible to physical processes. Perceptual constancy supports this: the stability of experienced qualities across variable physical inputs suggests that phenomenal properties do not reduce to the sensory states that occasion them. The constancy is a feature of experience, constituted in part by the subject, not merely read off from the physical signal.

The **bidirectional interaction** tenet is supported by the active character of constancy. If constancy involves attentional selection—choosing the stable distal interpretation—then consciousness contributes to shaping what is perceived, not merely registering it. The Map interprets perceptual constancy as a case where consciousness acts on sensory processing, biasing the visual system toward stable object representation.

The **minimal quantum interaction** tenet is relevant if the selection among competing perceptual interpretations involves quantum-level biasing. The Map does not claim this is established, but notes that the rapid, sub-millisecond timescale at which constancy computations operate is precisely the regime where quantum effects in neural processing would be most relevant, should such effects exist.

More broadly, perceptual constancy illustrates why **Occam's Razor has limits** in this domain. The simplest account—that constancy is "just" computation—leaves the phenomenal dimension entirely unexplained. A richer ontology, one that includes irreducible phenomenal properties shaped by consciousness, provides a more adequate account of what is actually experienced.
