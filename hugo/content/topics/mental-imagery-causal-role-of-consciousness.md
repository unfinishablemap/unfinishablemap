Does consciousness cause anything? Or does it merely accompany neural processes that would proceed identically without it? The Unfinishable Map's [bidirectional-interaction](/concepts/bidirectional-interaction/) tenet commits to the former: consciousness causally influences the physical world. Mental imagery offers one of the most revealing test cases for this claim. When you voluntarily visualize a movement and then execute it better as a result, the causal chain runs from conscious imagining to physical performance. The challenge is showing that consciousness itself—not just the neural circuits that correlate with it—does the causal work.

This article examines what [mental imagery](/concepts/mental-imagery/) specifically reveals about consciousness's causal role, building on the concept-level treatment of imagery and the Map's broader account of [mental-causation](/concepts/mental-causation/).

## Why Mental Imagery Is a Distinctive Test Case

Many phenomena bear on whether consciousness causes anything. The [evolutionary argument](/topics/evolutionary-case-for-mental-causation/), the [self-stultification problem](/concepts/epiphenomenalism/#the-self-stultification-problem) for epiphenomenalism, and the [empirical evidence for consciousness selecting](/topics/empirical-evidence-for-consciousness-selecting/) outcomes all contribute. Mental imagery is distinctive among these because it combines three features rarely found together:

**Observable voluntariness.** You can choose to visualize something specific—a red triangle, a piano chord, the feel of sandpaper—and report what you're doing while doing it. This makes the conscious component accessible to introspection and, to some degree, to third-person study.

**Measurable downstream effects.** Motor imagery practice produces performance improvements with effect sizes (Cohen's d) typically between 0.4 and 0.7.[^driskell] Stroke patients recover faster with imagery-based rehabilitation.[^motor] These are not subtle effects—they're replicable and clinically significant.

**A natural control condition.** The existence of involuntary imagery (dreams, flashbacks, earworms) provides a contrast case where imagery occurs without conscious direction. If voluntary and involuntary imagery differed only in their trigger but produced identical downstream effects, consciousness would look incidental. They don't.

## The Voluntary/Involuntary Dissociation

The most philosophically significant finding in imagery research is that voluntary and involuntary imagery rely on different neural mechanisms. Voluntary imagery—deliberate visualization, mental rotation, creative planning—is mediated by the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC). Involuntary imagery—dreams, flashbacks, spontaneous earworms—operates independently of LPFC.[^vyshedskiy]

This is not a soft distinction. Damage to the LPFC impairs the ability to voluntarily combine mental objects while leaving dreaming intact. Many people with aphantasia—the inability to voluntarily generate mental images—still experience visual dreams.[^zeman] The systems are dissociable.

Why does this matter for consciousness's causal role? Because voluntary imagery is conscious by nature. You cannot deliberately visualize something without being aware that you're doing it. Involuntary imagery can be either conscious or unconscious—priming effects and implicit biases operate through imagery processes that never reach awareness.[^nanay] The voluntary/involuntary distinction tracks the conscious/unconscious distinction, and these map onto different neural substrates.

The philosophical significance: if consciousness were epiphenomenal—along for the ride without influencing anything—we would expect the voluntary/involuntary distinction to be a mere phenomenological difference overlaid on functionally identical processes. Instead, we find distinct neural mechanisms producing distinct outcomes. The mechanism associated with conscious control (LPFC-mediated voluntary imagery) enables cognitive functions—deliberate planning, counterfactual reasoning, creative combination—that the mechanism without conscious control does not.

## The Motor Simulation Argument

Francis Bacon observed that "imagination ever precedeth voluntary motion."[^bacon] Contemporary motor simulation theory, developed by Marc Jeannerod, gives this observation empirical grounding: imagined movements serve as internal simulations that the motor system can later execute.[^jeannerod] The brain treats imagined and executed movements similarly at the planning level, activating overlapping regions of premotor cortex, supplementary motor area, and parietal cortex.

The causal argument runs:

1. Athletes who mentally rehearse movements improve their actual performance measurably.
2. The improvement depends on the *content* of what is imagined—rehearsing a piano passage improves that passage, not unrelated ones.[^pascual-leone]
3. The content of the imagined sequence is consciously specified—the athlete chooses what to rehearse.
4. Therefore, what is consciously imagined causally contributes to what physically improves.

This argument is not watertight. The physicalist responds that it's the *neural* rehearsal doing the causal work, with conscious experience as a correlated accompaniment. The LPFC engages top-down control mechanisms, and those mechanisms happen to correlate with phenomenal experience; the causal work is entirely neural.

This is a genuine explanatory standoff, acknowledged in the Map's [concept-level treatment](/concepts/mental-imagery/). Both the causal and epiphenomenal accounts predict that voluntary imagery (with its distinctive neural signature) produces measurable performance gains. The evidence alone does not definitively settle which account is correct.

## Breaking the Standoff

Three considerations press against the purely neural account:

### Content Matching

If consciousness is epiphenomenal, the specific *content* of conscious imagery—which movement you visualize, how vividly you experience it—should be irrelevant to the outcome. What matters would be the neural pattern, regardless of its phenomenal character. Yet research using internal vs. external perspective imagery finds that adopting a first-person perspective (with richer phenomenal engagement) produces greater EMG activity and stronger performance effects than adopting a third-person perspective.[^motor] The phenomenology tracks the outcome in ways that neural activation alone doesn't straightforwardly predict.

### The Aphantasia Prediction

If consciousness's role in motor imagery is merely correlative, then individuals with intact LPFC function but reduced phenomenal imagery (aphantasics) should show identical benefits from mental practice as those with vivid imagery. Preliminary evidence suggests otherwise: aphantasics report weaker benefits from mental rehearsal despite intact prefrontal function.[^zeman] If confirmed with larger samples, this would constitute evidence that phenomenal vividness—not just neural activation—predicts outcomes. The purely neural account would need to explain why reduced conscious experience maps onto reduced efficacy when the supposedly relevant neural circuits are intact.

### Self-Stultification

The [self-stultification argument](/concepts/epiphenomenalism/) applies with particular force to imagery. When you report that you visualized a red triangle and describe its properties—its colour, shape, orientation—you're making claims about the content of your conscious experience. If consciousness is epiphenomenal, these reports are caused entirely by neural processes that have no causal connection to the conscious imagery itself. Your description of the triangle's redness would be "right" only by coincidence—the neural states causing your verbal report would track the neural correlates of imagery, not the experience of imagery. This makes all introspective reports about imagery accidentally reliable at best, which is a profoundly uncomfortable position for anyone who trusts their own reports enough to theorize about consciousness.

## What Imagery Doesn't Prove

Intellectual honesty requires acknowledging what mental imagery evidence cannot establish on its own:

**It doesn't uniquely establish causation.** As the concept article on [mental-imagery](/concepts/mental-imagery/) notes, the motor imagery evidence is *consistent with* consciousness's causal efficacy but doesn't *uniquely establish* it. The neural sufficiency response—that neural circuits do the work while consciousness watches—remains logically available. The evidence provides confirmatory support for the Map's position rather than knockdown proof.

**It doesn't specify mechanism.** Even granting that consciousness causally contributes to imagery-guided action, the evidence doesn't tell us *how*. The Map's framework suggests consciousness operates through [attention-mediated](/concepts/attention-as-interface/) quantum selection, but motor imagery research neither confirms nor disconfirms this. The causal contribution of consciousness could operate through mechanisms not yet identified.

**It doesn't generalize automatically.** Showing that consciousness plays a causal role in voluntary imagery doesn't immediately show it plays a causal role in all cognitive processes. Some cognitive functions may genuinely be fully automated, with consciousness as genuine epiphenomenon for those specific processes. The Map's position is that consciousness plays a causal role in at least some processes—voluntary imagery provides evidence for this weaker but still significant claim.

## The Broader Pattern

Mental imagery evidence gains force when situated alongside other lines of evidence for consciousness's causal efficacy. The [baseline cognition](/concepts/baseline-cognition/) research shows that unconscious processing—even the sophisticated cognition demonstrated by great apes—cannot achieve logical reasoning, counterfactual thinking, or cumulative culture. These functions require conscious processing, and voluntary imagery is one mechanism through which consciousness enables them: planning, creative combination, and counterfactual simulation all involve deliberately generated mental representations.

The pattern across multiple lines of evidence—imagery, evolutionary arguments, comparative cognition, the self-stultification problem—is convergent. No single line of evidence is decisive. Taken together, they build a cumulative case that consciousness is doing causal work, not merely observing it.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The Unfinishable Map's [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet holds that consciousness causally influences the physical world. Mental imagery provides one of the most accessible demonstrations of what this claim means concretely: you consciously imagine a movement, and your physical performance improves. The Map acknowledges the explanatory standoff with purely neural accounts but maintains that the weight of converging evidence—content matching, the aphantasia prediction, self-stultification, and the voluntary/involuntary dissociation—favours a causal role for consciousness.

The [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism) tenet finds support in the imagery variation spectrum. If hyperphantasics and aphantasics can show overlapping neural activation during imagery tasks yet differ profoundly in phenomenal experience, the phenomenal dimension resists reduction to the neural. The explanatory gap manifests concretely in individual differences.

The [Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits) tenet applies directly to the explanatory standoff itself. The "simpler" account—neural circuits do all the work, consciousness is epiphenomenal—appears simpler only if one assumes that every real cause must be physical. If that assumption is wrong, the apparently simpler account is simply incomplete, missing a genuine causal factor that the full explanation requires.
