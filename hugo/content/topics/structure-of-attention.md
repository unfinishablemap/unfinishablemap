Attention is not a single phenomenon. It divides into three architecturally distinct modes—exogenous (captured), instructed (cued), and willed (self-generated)—each with different triggers, timescales, and neural signatures. This structure matters philosophically because it identifies precisely where consciousness might do genuine causal work. When you freely choose where to direct focus, neural mechanisms engage that don't engage when you follow instructions or when attention is captured by salience. The additional frontal theta oscillations, bidirectional frontoparietal coherence, and extra frontal recruitment during willed attention mark what The Unfinishable Map claims consciousness contributes: internal decision-making about what to select.

This article maps the architecture of attention—how its three modes differ, where they operate in the brain, and what the phenomenology of each reveals about the mind-matter interface.

## The Three Modes

### Exogenous Attention: Captured

A loud noise snaps your head around. A flash in peripheral vision seizes your focus. This is exogenous attention—fast (~100ms to deploy), reflexive, and transient. You experience being *pulled*.

| Feature | Exogenous |
|---------|-----------|
| **Trigger** | External salience |
| **Deployment** | ~100ms |
| **Duration** | Transient (100-300ms) |
| **Effort** | None |
| **Control** | Involuntary |

Exogenous attention operates through the ventral attention network (temporoparietal junction, ventral frontal cortex). It generates "inhibition of return"—after ~300ms, the captured location is actively suppressed, preventing repeated capture by the same stimulus.

### Instructed Attention: Cued

"Look at the red dot." You follow the instruction, directing attention to the specified target. This is instructed attention—top-down but externally prompted. The decision about *what* to attend was made outside you; you merely implement it.

| Feature | Instructed |
|---------|------------|
| **Trigger** | External cue/instruction |
| **Deployment** | ~300ms |
| **Duration** | Can be sustained |
| **Effort** | Low-moderate |
| **Control** | Voluntary implementation |

Instructed attention uses the dorsal attention network (intraparietal sulcus, frontal eye fields, superior parietal cortex). It's genuinely top-down—unlike exogenous capture—but differs from willed attention in a crucial way: the goal originates externally.

### Willed Attention: Self-Generated

You're at a noisy party. You decide to focus on your conversation partner's words, filtering out the background. No one told you to; you chose. This is willed attention—internally generated, requiring genuine decision about where to direct focus.

| Feature | Willed |
|---------|--------|
| **Trigger** | Internal decision |
| **Deployment** | ~300ms |
| **Duration** | Can be sustained |
| **Effort** | High |
| **Control** | Fully voluntary |

The willed/instructed distinction is critical. Research (Bengson et al. 2019; Nadra & Mangun 2023) identifies three neural signatures unique to willed attention:

**Frontal theta oscillations**: ~500ms after choosing where to attend, frontal theta power increases—absent in instructed attention. Theta oscillations mark genuine decision-making.

**Bidirectional frontoparietal coherence**: During willed attention, theta-band coherence between frontal and parietal regions flows both ways. If consciousness merely triggered attention mechanisms, we'd expect one-way flow: decision → implementation. The bidirectional pattern suggests ongoing communication.

**Additional frontal recruitment**: Willed attention engages frontal regions (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex) beyond those active during instructed attention. This is the decision-making machinery that instruction-following bypasses.

## The Phenomenology

Each mode feels different from the inside, and these differences track the neural distinctions.

### Capture Feels Like Being Pulled

When a loud sound seizes your attention, the phenomenology is passive. Something happens *to* you. The world intrudes. There's no sense of agency because there isn't any—exogenous attention operates automatically.

### Instruction Feels Like Following

When you follow a cue, there's more active engagement than capture but less than free choice. You're implementing someone else's decision. The phenomenology is intermediate—neither purely passive nor fully autonomous.

### Willing Feels Like Effort

When you choose where to attend, the experience includes a distinctive sense of *work*. Sustained willed attention is metabolically expensive and feels that way. William James observed that "the free will question relates solely to the amount of effort of attention."

This phenomenological difference—why willing feels effortful while capture doesn't—demands explanation. If all attention were just neural computation, why would some modes feel like work? The [mental-effort](/concepts/mental-effort/) article develops this: effort may feel real because it *is* real work—consciousness actively holding neural patterns through repeated observation.

## The 300ms Window

Both instructed and willed attention take ~300ms to deploy, compared to ~100ms for exogenous capture. This shared timescale is striking—and potentially significant.

The same ~300ms window appears in motor selection. Thura & Cisek (2014) identified a "commitment point" ~280ms before voluntary movement where frontal-parietal coherence strengthens and options collapse to a decision. Giacomo Rizzolatti's premotor theory of attention proposes that attention shifts *are* motor plans—the brain's preparation for orienting movements.

If willed attention and willed action share a common mechanism, the ~300ms window marks where consciousness engages the selection interface. The timing is too slow for exogenous reflexes, too slow for automatic processing, but right for deliberate choice.

For the Map's framework, this temporal structure is suggestive. If consciousness operates through something like quantum Zeno effects—rapid observation holding desired patterns stable—it would require time for sustained engagement. The ~300ms deployment window might provide that time. This remains speculative, but the timing is striking: exogenous attention's brief duration (~100ms) would be insufficient for sustained influence, while willed attention's sustained character fits what such a mechanism would require. See [attention-interface-mechanisms](/topics/attention-as-selection-interface/) for candidate neural sites and timing constraints that could support this interface.

## The Neural Architecture

Three large-scale brain networks implement attention control:

| Network | Regions | Function |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Dorsal attention** | IPS, FEF, superior parietal | Voluntary spatial attention, goal-directed selection |
| **Ventral attention** | TPJ, VFC | Bottom-up capture, reorienting |
| **Salience network** | Anterior insula, ACC | Detecting salient events, switching between networks |

### The Frontoparietal Division

The 2025 COGITATE adversarial testing found that conscious *content* tracks better with posterior cortex than prefrontal regions. Decoding of stimulus categories was "very short-lived in the prefrontal cortex and did not track the duration of the stimulus."

This suggests a division: attention networks (frontoparietal) control the spotlight; consciousness networks (posterior "hot zone") host the content. The interface might be where these systems meet—where attention determined *what* meets consciousness that experiences *that what*.

### The Thalamic Relay

The thalamus sits at the junction where ascending sensory signals meet descending voluntary signals. Frontal cortex modulates thalamic gating, determining what gains cortical access. This makes the thalamus a candidate selection site—where consciousness might influence which information propagates.

Dynamic causal modeling identifies:
- **Ascending pathways** (PFC←thalamic, ACC←thalamic): External sensory inputs
- **Descending pathways** (frontal→thalamic): Voluntary shifts based on goals

The two-way traffic suggests the thalamus doesn't merely relay information but participates in active selection.

### The Salience Network as Switch

The anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex form the "salience network" that:
1. Detects salient events (potential capture)
2. Switches between large-scale networks when salience is detected
3. Modulates autonomic reactivity
4. Facilitates rapid access to motor systems

When you *choose* to redirect attention from an absorbing task, the salience network mediates that switch. It may be where consciousness "interrupts" ongoing processing—the mechanism for voluntary reorienting.

## The Stochastic Challenge

Pre-decision EEG alpha activity predicts subsequent free choices ~1000ms before participants decide. This seems to threaten the willed/instructed distinction: if brain states predict choices, is willing illusory?

Two interpretations compete:

**Neural noise interpretation**: Stochastic fluctuations in cortical excitability bias decisions. The "cause" of free decisions may be merely background noise.

**Attentional set interpretation**: Pre-stimulus alpha reflects prior intentions—task-specific attentional sets like "attend left vs. attend right." The brain tracks consequences of *previous* choices, not evidence against present ones.

The Map's response parallels its response to the [Libet experiments](/concepts/libet-experiments/):

1. **Selection among options**: Stochastic activity provides options; consciousness selects among them. Neural activity preceding choice doesn't show it *causes* choice in a way that excludes conscious selection.

2. **Resolution mismatch**: EEG operates at millimetre spatial resolution and millisecond temporal resolution. Quantum-level selection at ion channels or microtubules would be invisible. Finding macro-level correlates doesn't preclude micro-level selection.

3. **Distal intentions**: What appears as prediction may track prior conscious choices. The pre-stimulus brain state reflects how you've previously organized your attentional resources.

Finding that brain activity correlates with upcoming choices establishes that conscious choices are implemented through neural mechanisms—which the Map's framework accepts. It doesn't establish that neural mechanisms are *all* that's involved.

## Structure and the Interface

The three-mode structure of attention illuminates the [attention-as-interface](/concepts/attention-as-interface/) hypothesis. If attention is how consciousness influences matter:

**Exogenous attention** involves no conscious contribution. The world captures; you respond. Selection happens, but you didn't do it.

**Instructed attention** involves minimal conscious contribution. You implement an externally specified goal. Some agency, but the choice was outsourced.

**Willed attention** is where consciousness adds something. The frontal theta, the bidirectional coherence, the extra frontal recruitment—these neural signatures mark the contribution that instruction-following lacks.

The structure reveals the interface in action: when you will attention, machinery engages that doesn't engage otherwise. The phenomenology of effort corresponds to the neural distinctiveness.

A critic might respond: the neural differences simply reflect different computational pathways—internally-generated goals versus externally-provided ones—without requiring any non-physical contribution. The frontal theta and extra recruitment ARE the willing, not evidence OF willing beyond the neural.

The Map's response: this interpretation explains away rather than explains. If phenomenal experience is identical to neural processing, why does internally-generated selection feel like *effort* while externally-cued selection feels like *following*? The physicalist says these feelings are what those neural patterns *are*. But that relocates rather than solves the question: why do *these* patterns feel like effortful willing while *those* patterns feel passive? The correlation between phenomenology and neural signature demands explanation—and the Map proposes that consciousness genuinely contributes where willing occurs, which is why it both feels different and looks different.

## Contemplative Evidence

Meditation traditions provide phenomenological data on attention's structure. Two broad practice families map onto the three-mode framework:

**Focused attention (FA) meditation** trains willed attention. Practitioners repeatedly redirect focus to a chosen object (breath, mantra, image). When attention wanders—exogenous capture by a thought—they exercise willed attention to return. The explicit training develops the capacity for sustained voluntary attention.

**Open monitoring (OM) meditation** cultivates something else: receiving all contents without preference or intervention. Neither capture nor willing. The practitioner observes attention itself.

Neural signatures differ: FA increases frontal theta and ACC activation (the willed-attention signature); OM reduces them and increases alpha. Advanced practitioners report increasingly fine-grained awareness of the willed/captured distinction—consistent with introspective access to genuine differences.

Buddhist traditions raise a challenge: if there is no stable self, who does the willing? The no-self (*anatta*) doctrine suggests the "willer" is itself a construction. The Map's response is that the phenomenology of willing exists even if no permanent self does. The experience of effort, the sense of internal origination—these are data regardless of whether they emanate from a substantial self or from moment-to-moment processes. What matters for the mind-matter interface is that willing *happens* and shows distinctive neural signatures, not that a Cartesian ego performs it.

## Implications for Site Framework

### Dualism

If consciousness were identical to neural processing, willed and instructed attention should show identical signatures—both are "attention" achieving the same result. The neural distinction (frontal theta, bidirectional coherence, extra frontal recruitment) supports the claim that consciousness adds something when it decides. The additional machinery marks what's different about genuine willing.

### Bidirectional Interaction

The attention structure exemplifies the [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet. Consciousness selects where attention goes; attention determines what consciousness experiences. The bidirectional frontoparietal coherence during willed attention may be the neural signature of this two-way causal flow.

Jeffrey Schwartz's OCD research provides evidence: patients who learn to voluntarily redirect attention produce measurable brain changes (altered caudate metabolism). Whatever the mechanism, willed attention has physical consequences.

### Minimal Quantum Interaction

The ~300ms deployment window and sustained character of willed attention fit the [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) tenet. If consciousness operates through quantum Zeno effects, holding desired patterns through rapid observation, it requires sustained engagement—which willed attention provides and exogenous capture doesn't.

### Occam's Razor Has Limits

The simplest account would eliminate the willed/instructed distinction: all attention is just neural processing, with "willing" as post-hoc narrative. But this ignores the neural evidence. The frontal theta, the bidirectional coherence, the extra frontal recruitment—these mark *something*. If that something were "more neural processing," we'd need to explain why this particular kind of processing feels like willing rather than like anything else. The [Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits) tenet applies: simplicity is unreliable when it dismisses the phenomenon to be explained.

## What Would Challenge This View?

The framework would be undermined if:

1. **The willed/instructed distinction collapses** — If willed attention proves to be instructed attention with hidden cues, the neural distinctiveness would be artifactual.

2. **Willed attention becomes fully predictable** — If neural activity predicted choices with certainty (not just above chance), the space for selection would close.

3. **Artificial systems replicate the signatures** — If computational attention showed the same frontal theta and bidirectional coherence, it would suggest these mark computation rather than consciousness.

4. **Illusionism explains the phenomenology** — If the sense of effort could be explained as a functional illusion without remainder, the phenomenological argument would fail.

## Summary

Attention is not monolithic. It divides into three architecturally distinct modes: exogenous (fast, reflexive, passive), instructed (top-down but externally prompted), and willed (internally generated, effortful, uniquely neurally marked).

The structure matters because it identifies where consciousness might contribute. Willed attention shows frontal theta oscillations, bidirectional frontoparietal coherence, and additional frontal recruitment—absent in instructed attention despite identical behavioural outcomes. The phenomenology tracks the neuroscience: willing feels like work in a way that instruction-following doesn't.

For the Map's framework, this architecture illuminates the mind-matter interface. Consciousness acts through willed attention specifically—the mode that feels effortful and shows unique neural signatures. The ~300ms deployment window, the sustained character, the capacity for maintenance against distraction: these are the interface in action.
