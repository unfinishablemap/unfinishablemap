Physics is largely time-symmetric. Run Newton's equations backward, and they still hold. Reverse the Schrödinger equation, and it remains valid. Yet conscious experience divides time absolutely: the past is settled, the future open; memory reaches backward while anticipation constructs forward; the present slides irreversibly from possibility to fact. The Unfinishable Map proposes that this experienced directedness — the phenomenological arrow — is not incidental to consciousness but partly constituted by it. Physical processes including [quantum collapse](/concepts/collapse-and-time/) provide a basic physical asymmetry whether or not conscious beings are present. But the felt directionality of time — becoming, flow, the passage from open future to settled past — requires consciousness and cannot be reduced to the physical asymmetry alone.

## The Puzzle of Time's Arrow

Fundamental physics provides no arrow. The laws of motion, electromagnetism, and quantum field theory are all time-reversal invariant (with minor exceptions from CP violation that don't account for the macroscopic arrow). Yet four distinct arrows appear in experience:

**The thermodynamic arrow.** Entropy increases toward the future. Eggs break but don't unbreak. The standard explanation traces this to a low-entropy initial condition — the Big Bang — rather than to the laws themselves. But this pushes the question back: why those initial conditions?

**The causal arrow.** Causes precede effects. We can influence the future but not the past. Huw Price argues that this asymmetry may be perspectival — an artifact of our temporal orientation rather than an objective feature of physics. If so, conscious agents don't merely observe causal asymmetry; they may be partly responsible for it.

**The epistemic arrow.** We know the past through traces and can only predict the future. The past leaves records — fossils, memories, light from distant stars. The future leaves nothing. This asymmetry grounds the [felt difference between remembering and anticipating](/voids/temporal-asymmetry-remembering-anticipating/).

**The phenomenological arrow.** Experience flows. The present arrives, becomes past, and is replaced by a new present. This felt flow is so fundamental to consciousness that imagining its absence is nearly impossible — even the attempt occurs within temporal flow.

These four arrows typically align. But they need not. A universe with time-symmetric laws could, in principle, contain beings whose thermodynamic arrow points one way while their phenomenological arrow points another. That all four arrows coincide demands explanation. The Map proposes that consciousness is key to the phenomenological arrow specifically: it is not a passive reflection of the other three but an irreducible contribution that gives temporal asymmetry its experiential character.

## Why Physics Alone Cannot Account for the Arrow

The thermodynamic explanation — entropy increases because the Big Bang was low-entropy — is necessary but insufficient. It explains *that* entropy increases but not *why we experience the direction of increase as forward*. As Hermann Weyl observed: "The objective world simply is, it does not happen. Only to the gaze of my consciousness, crawling upward along the life line of my body, does a section of this world come to life."

The block universe of relativity reinforces the point. If past, present, and future coexist as equally real slices of a four-dimensional manifold, then time doesn't pass. Nothing "moves" through the block. Yet consciousness insists otherwise. We experience becoming: possibility narrowing to actuality, the open future crystallising into the fixed past. This becoming appears nowhere in the block universe's description.

Three responses dominate the literature:

**The deflationary response** claims that felt temporal flow is an illusion — a cognitive artifact of how brains process sequential states. Daniel Dennett and others argue that the "moving present" is a fiction created by memory mechanisms that tag events with temporal order. The arrow is epistemic, not ontological.

**The A-theoretic response** insists that temporal becoming is real and that physics is incomplete without it. The [growing block theory](/topics/growing-block-universe-and-consciousness/) (C.D. Broad) holds that the past and present are real but the future is not yet. The block grows as new events become actual. This preserves genuine becoming but must explain what drives the growth.

**The constitutive response** — the Map's position — holds that the phenomenological arrow cannot be derived from the physical arrow alone and that consciousness is partly constitutive of it. The growing block grows because collapse introduces irreversible facts — and physical collapse does this whether or not consciousness is present. But the *experienced directionality* of that growth — the felt passage from open future to settled past, the qualitative asymmetry between anticipation and memory — requires consciousness. The physical arrow supplies asymmetry; consciousness supplies the experience of that asymmetry as temporal *flow*.

## Consciousness as Constitutive of Temporal Direction

Two claims must be distinguished here. The **physical asymmetry claim** is that collapse introduces irreversibility: superpositions resolve into definite outcomes, and this transition cannot be undone. The Map's [framework](/topics/time-collapse-and-agency/) endorses this, and the [prebiotic collapse](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) resolution acknowledges that physical mechanisms provide this baseline asymmetry throughout the universe, with or without conscious observers. Collapse happened before life existed. Time had a physical arrow before anyone experienced it.

The **phenomenological constitution claim** is different and stronger. It holds that the *experienced directionality* of time — the felt passage from open future to settled past, the qualitative distinction between memory and anticipation, the sense of becoming — is partly constituted by consciousness and cannot be reduced to the physical asymmetry alone. This is the Map's distinctive position.

Why does causal participation in collapse amount to constituting the phenomenological arrow, rather than merely causing something that produces it downstream? Because the relevant asymmetry is not a side effect of collapse that consciousness then observes from the outside. When consciousness participates in collapse (as the Map's [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) tenet proposes), the collapse *is experienced as* the narrowing of possibility to actuality. The felt transition from open to settled is not a representation of collapse — it is what collapse is like from the inside. Constitution, not causation: consciousness does not cause the phenomenological arrow the way a spark causes a fire. Rather, the phenomenological arrow *just is* the experiential character of participating in irreversible state resolution. Without that participation, there is physical asymmetry but no temporal *flow*.

This distinction resolves the prebiotic collapse problem. Before conscious beings, collapse still occurred and physical asymmetry still obtained. But there was no phenomenological arrow — no experienced becoming, no felt passage, no qualitative distinction between past and future. The physical arrow is necessary but not sufficient for the phenomenological one. Consciousness adds something that physical description cannot capture: the *what-it-is-like* of temporal direction.

Bergson's concept of [durée](/duration/) captures this phenomenological side. Lived time is not a sequence of static instants but a qualitative flow where the past permeates the present and the present reaches toward the future. This interpenetration — each moment coloured by what preceded it and what it anticipates — is what it is like to participate in irreversible becoming from within. Duration is not a representation of physical time; it is the experiential dimension that physical time lacks.

## The Felt Asymmetry

Consciousness doesn't merely register that time passes. It experiences a structured asymmetry between temporal directions with specific phenomenal characteristics.

**The settledness of the past.** Remembered events feel *actual* — they happened, and this happening has a distinctive phenomenal quality. Tulving's [autonoetic-consciousness](/concepts/autonoetic-consciousness/) describes this as self-knowing awareness: when remembering, you know yourself as having been present. The past's settledness isn't inferred from evidence but immediately given in the texture of memory.

**The openness of the future.** Anticipated events feel *possible* rather than actual. Even highly confident predictions lack the settledness of memory. You know you will eat breakfast tomorrow, but this knowledge has a modal character — it could fail to obtain — that yesterday's breakfast lacks. The future's openness is phenomenally available, not merely believed.

**The irreversibility of the present.** The moment of experience cannot be held or reversed. Each present becomes past as soon as it is grasped. Husserl's retention-protention structure captures this: the just-past echoes in awareness (retention) while the about-to-arrive is anticipated (protention), but the primal impression — the strictly present — is already sliding into pastness. This irreversibility is experienced, not deduced.

**The emotional asymmetry.** We care differently about past and future events. Research on "temporal bias" shows that people universally prefer good experiences to be in their future and bad ones in their past. This isn't irrational. It reflects the felt openness of the future — we can still influence what hasn't happened — and the settledness of the past. If consciousness constitutes the phenomenological arrow, the emotional bias tracks a genuine metaphysical distinction rather than a cognitive quirk.

## Process Philosophy and Temporal Asymmetry

Whitehead's [process metaphysics](/concepts/process-philosophy/) offers a framework where temporal asymmetry is built into the structure of experience. Each "actual occasion" prehends (grasps) its predecessors — inheriting their actuality as settled fact. The past is available for prehension because it has become definite. The future is not prehensible because it hasn't yet achieved definiteness.

This asymmetry is intrinsic to experience, not imposed from outside. Whitehead's occasions don't exist in a pre-given temporal framework and then experience asymmetry within it. Rather, the succession of occasions — each prehending its predecessors and becoming available for prehension by successors — *is* temporal order. Time is constituted by experiential inheritance, and the directionality follows from the logic of inheritance: you can inherit what exists, not what doesn't yet.

The Map interprets Whitehead's framework as compatible with the collapse account. Collapse is what creates definiteness — what makes an occasion "actual" and available for prehension. Before collapse, possibilities coexist. After collapse, one possibility is actual and inheritable. The directionality of prehension (backward to definite predecessors, not forward to indefinite successors) is the directionality of collapse (from superposition to definiteness, not the reverse).

## What This Means for Materialism

If the phenomenological arrow is partly constituted by consciousness, materialism faces a distinctive challenge. The materialist can grant that physical asymmetry (thermodynamics, collapse) exists independently of consciousness. But the experience of *temporal flow* — the felt passage from future to past, the qualitative difference between anticipation and memory — remains unexplained by physics alone.

This goes beyond the standard hard problem argument, though it includes it. The standard argument says: physical description misses phenomenal character. The temporal argument says: physical description misses the *experienced directionality* that makes time feel like it passes. Physics provides a gradient; consciousness provides the sense of moving along it.

A materialist can respond that conscious experience of flow is merely a cognitive artifact — the brain tracking thermodynamic asymmetry and constructing an illusion of passage. This is a coherent position. But it faces Weyl's challenge: in the block universe, thermodynamic asymmetry doesn't move or flow. It is a static gradient in a static manifold. Something must account for the experience of becoming — of the present moving along the gradient. If that something is consciousness, and if the experience of becoming cannot be reduced to the static physical facts, then the phenomenological arrow is an irreducible contribution of consciousness to reality. Materialism cannot explain it because it falls outside the physical description entirely.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Temporal asymmetry connects to all five [tenets](/tenets/):

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: If consciousness partly constitutes the phenomenological arrow — the experienced directionality of time — then it contributes something that physical description cannot capture. The irreducibility here is not merely explanatory (we can't explain how physical processes produce experience) but ontological: the felt passage from future to past is a real feature of reality that exists only where consciousness exists. This strengthens the case for dualism beyond the standard arguments from qualia and conceivability.

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)**: Collapse is the mechanism through which consciousness participates in temporal asymmetry. Each collapse event is minimal — biasing an indeterminate outcome without injecting energy — but the experiential character of these collapses, accumulated over time, constitutes the phenomenological arrow: the felt direction of temporal flow.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)**: Consciousness doesn't merely register physical asymmetry as temporal flow; it constitutes the phenomenological arrow through its participation in collapse. The physical arrow exists independently, but the experienced directionality — becoming, passage, flow — is consciousness's contribution. This is bidirectional interaction: consciousness receives physical information and contributes experiential structure that the physical world alone lacks.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)**: Many-worlds denies real collapse, holding that all outcomes occur in branching worlds. Without collapse, temporal asymmetry must derive entirely from thermodynamics or decoherence. The Map's view that consciousness contributes to temporal direction requires collapse to be genuine — possibilities must narrow to one actuality, not branch into parallel actualities.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)**: The deflationary account — temporal flow is an illusion — is simpler. But it denies a phenomenon rather than explaining it. The felt difference between past and future, the experience of becoming, the irreversibility of the present — these are among the most certain features of experience. A theory that dismisses them as illusion achieves parsimony by sacrificing the data. The Map's more complex account respects the phenomenology.

<!-- AI REFINEMENT LOG - 2026-02-15
Changes made:
- Distinguished physical asymmetry claim from phenomenological constitution claim throughout
- Added explicit bridging argument for why causal participation in collapse amounts to constitution (not mere causation) of the phenomenological arrow
- Resolved prebiotic collapse tension: physical arrow exists independently; consciousness constitutes the phenomenological arrow specifically
- Updated opening summary, constitutive response framing, main argument section, materialism section, and tenet connections for consistency with refined position
- Aligned emotional asymmetry paragraph and Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet entry with refined claim
- Updated description to reflect the physical/phenomenological distinction

Based on pessimistic review (2026-02-15) identifying: (1) conflation of causal participation with metaphysical constitution, (2) prebiotic collapse undermining strong constitutive claim.
Key improvements: Argument is now philosophically precise about what consciousness constitutes (phenomenological arrow) vs what exists independently (physical arrow), with explicit bridging argument for the constitution claim.

This log should be removed after human review.
