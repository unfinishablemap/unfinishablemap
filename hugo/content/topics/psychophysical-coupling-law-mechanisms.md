The Unfinishable Map's [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet claims consciousness causally influences physical outcomes. For this claim to be more than a philosophical posture, there must be a mechanism—a specifiable pathway from phenomenal states to physical selections. Five candidate mechanisms have been proposed, but they vary enormously in precision and testability. Only two (Stapp's attention-observation model and Eccles' intention-probability model) approach the specificity required for scientific engagement. This article examines what each mechanism actually proposes at the physical level, what makes a coupling mechanism adequate, and what the current mechanistic landscape reveals about the testability of interactionist dualism.

For the broader framework—why [psychophysical-laws](/concepts/psychophysical-laws/) are needed, how supervenience laws differ from [selection-laws](/concepts/selection-laws/), and the four families of coupling laws—see [psychophysical-coupling](/concepts/psychophysical-coupling/) and [psychophysical-laws-framework](/topics/psychophysical-laws-framework/).

## What Makes a Mechanism Adequate?

A coupling mechanism must do more than assert that consciousness affects physics. It must specify three things with enough precision that the specification could, in principle, be shown wrong:

**1. A phenomenal variable with measurable correlates.** The mechanism must identify which aspect of conscious experience does the coupling—attention, intention, valence, qualitative character—and that aspect must have neural correlates amenable to measurement. Without this, the mechanism generates no predictions.

**2. A physical parameter susceptible to non-physical influence.** The mechanism must identify where in physics consciousness intervenes. Quantum indeterminacy provides the natural candidate: physics supplies probability distributions without determining specific outcomes. The mechanism must specify *which* quantum parameter is affected—observation rate, tunneling probability, measurement basis, or something else.

**3. A causal pathway connecting them.** The mechanism must explain how changes in the phenomenal variable produce changes in the physical parameter. This is where most proposals fail. Asserting that "attention affects observation rate" requires showing how a phenomenal state (the felt quality of attending) could modulate a physical process (the frequency of quantum measurements).

These three requirements—measurable phenomenal variable, susceptible physical parameter, and connecting pathway—constitute the specification threshold. Below it, a proposal remains a metaphor.

## The Two Developed Mechanisms

### Stapp: Attention as Quantum Observation Rate

Henry Stapp's model, developed over several decades and presented most fully in *Mindful Universe* (2007), provides the most detailed coupling mechanism available. It builds on von Neumann's formulation of quantum mechanics, which distinguishes three processes:

- **Process 2**: Deterministic evolution of the quantum state (Schrödinger equation)
- **Process 1**: The observer's choice of which question to ask (which observable to measure)
- **Process 3**: Nature's answer (the measurement outcome, governed by Born probabilities)

In standard physics, Process 1 is treated as the experimenter's free choice—quantum mechanics doesn't explain why the experimenter asks *this* question rather than *that* one. Stapp argues that consciousness operates at Process 1: it selects which question gets asked of neural quantum systems. The answer (Process 3) remains random, governed by probability. But which *question* gets asked—which observable gets measured—determines the probability distribution over answers.

The quantum Zeno effect provides the amplification mechanism. Rapid repeated observation of a quantum system prevents it from evolving away from its current state—an experimentally verified phenomenon. Stapp proposes that conscious attention corresponds to high-frequency Process 1 actions: attending to a neural pattern means rapidly and repeatedly "asking" whether that pattern obtains. This holds the pattern in place, preventing quantum evolution toward competing alternatives.

**The phenomenal variable** is the intensity and focus of attention, experienced as mental effort. William James described volitional effort as "the essential phenomenon of will"—the felt work of sustaining attention against distraction. Stapp identifies this phenomenology with the rapidity of Process 1 actions: effort feels like work because it *is* work—the work of maintaining high observation frequency.

**The physical parameter** is the rate of quantum observations on neural firing patterns. Higher observation rate means stronger Zeno holding, meaning the attended pattern persists longer against thermal fluctuation and competing neural activity.

**The causal pathway**: Consciousness (phenomenal attention) → Process 1 actions (measurement events) → quantum Zeno effect → neural pattern stability → behaviour.

**Testable predictions**: Jeffrey Schwartz's work with OCD patients provides indirect evidence. Patients who used mindful attention to resist compulsions (relabelling obsessive thoughts as "brain noise") showed measurable changes in caudate nucleus activation—changes attributable to directed mental effort rather than pharmacological intervention. Meditation research documents that sustained attention training changes neural connectivity in attention networks. Willed attention produces different frontal-parietal signatures than reflexive attention.

**The major objection** is the decoherence timescale problem. Monte Carlo simulations by Araujo et al. (2014) showed that the quantum Zeno effect "breaks down for timescales greater than the brain decoherence time." If neural quantum states decohere in femtoseconds while attention operates at millisecond timescales, the Zeno mechanism cannot bridge the gap.

**Possible responses**: The mechanism might operate not on sustained superpositions but at the point of outcome determination after decoherence has already selected preferred bases. Decoherence selects which outcomes are possible; consciousness biases which possible outcome becomes actual. This shifts the mechanism from "freezing superpositions" to "selecting among decoherence-produced alternatives"—less exotic, but still a form of downward causation operating where physics leaves outcomes undetermined.

### Eccles: Intention as Quantum Tunneling Probability

John Eccles' psychon-dendron theory, developed in *How the Self Controls Its Brain* (1994) and earlier collaborative work with Karl Popper, proposes a different coupling point: neurotransmitter release at synaptic junctions.

Eccles identifies each of approximately 40 million dendrons (fundamental neural units of the cerebral cortex) as coupled to a mental unit called a "psychon." In willed action, the psychon modulates the probability of neurotransmitter vesicle release from presynaptic terminals through quantum tunneling effects in synaptic exocytosis.

**The phenomenal variable** is intention—the experience of willing an action. Eccles writes that "mental acts of attention and intention activate appropriate regions of the cerebral cortex, with an intention to move initiating the firing of neurons in the supplementary motor area about 200 milliseconds before the intended movement."

**The physical parameter** is the probability of vesicle release at individual synapses. Vesicle exocytosis involves molecular processes small enough for quantum tunneling effects to matter. The psychon acts as a "quantum probability field" that modulates tunneling probability without injecting energy—biasing which vesicles release, not forcing release against physical constraints.

**The causal pathway**: Consciousness (intention) → psychon influence → quantum tunneling probability modulation → altered vesicle release probability → changed neural firing patterns → motor output.

**Testable predictions**: Eccles cited Libet's timing experiments as supporting evidence. The intention to move precedes the movement by about 200ms, with preparatory neural activity (readiness potential) detectable even earlier. Voluntary and involuntary movements should show different patterns of vesicle release probability in motor cortex—a prediction that current neuroscience methods cannot directly test at the individual-synapse level but that future techniques might address.

**The major objection** is the [pairing-problem](/concepts/pairing-problem/): how does an immaterial psychon locate a specific dendron? If mental entities lack spatial properties, they cannot stand in spatial relations to neural structures. Eccles' one-to-one psychon-dendron pairing assumes a spatial relationship the framework cannot justify. This is a version of the classical interaction problem that Descartes faced with the pineal gland—but relocated to 40 million synaptic interfaces rather than one anatomical structure.

## The Three Underdeveloped Candidates

Three other phenomenal-physical mappings have been proposed but lack the mechanistic specificity of Stapp's or Eccles' models. Their incompleteness is instructive—it reveals where the coupling problem remains genuinely open.

### Valence as Motivational Force

Pain asymbolia provides the strongest evidence that phenomenal valence does causal work. Patients with this condition detect and represent tissue damage normally—they know they're being harmed—but don't experience the *felt badness* of pain and consequently lack normal avoidance motivation. The representational content (damage detection) is intact; the phenomenal quality (badness) is absent; and the behavioural consequence (avoidance) disappears. This dissociation suggests that felt valence, not merely damage representation, causally drives motivational behaviour.

If valence-motivation coupling is real, it would constitute a psychophysical mechanism: phenomenal goodness/badness → approach/avoidance selection. But no one has proposed a quantum-level pathway by which felt valence could modulate physical processes. Unlike attention (which maps to observation rate) or intention (which maps to tunneling probability), valence lacks a candidate physical parameter. The gap between the phenomenological evidence (pain asymbolia) and the mechanistic specification (unknown) marks a genuine frontier.

### Qualia as Basis Selection

The most speculative proposal: perhaps specific phenomenal qualities—the redness of red, the pitch of middle C—correspond to specific measurement bases in quantum collapse. Consciousness doesn't just select outcomes; it selects *what question to ask*, and different qualitative characters correspond to different questions.

This proposal has no developed theory, no mechanism connecting qualitative character to measurement basis, and no empirical evidence. Its value is conceptual: it illustrates that coupling might operate not at the outcome level (which answer) but at the question level (which observable). If future work develops this idea, it would represent a different kind of selection than what Stapp or Eccles propose—basis selection rather than outcome biasing.

### Unity as Sustained Entanglement

Phenomenal unity—the binding of diverse sensory information into a single experiential field—might correspond to quantum entanglement rather than classical correlation. If so, consciousness might actively sustain entanglement against decoherence, and the scope of phenomenal unity would track the scope of neural entanglement.

Kerskens and Pérez (2022) reported MRI signatures consistent with quantum entanglement in human brain activity, with entanglement markers correlating with conscious state. The Wiest et al. microtubule study (2024) found that microtubule-stabilizing drugs delayed anaesthetic onset with a large effect size (Cohen's d = 1.9). Both require independent replication, and correlation between entanglement markers and consciousness doesn't establish that consciousness *causes* or *sustains* entanglement.

## The Gap Between Mechanism and Metaphor

The five candidates fall into three tiers of mechanistic development:

**Tier 1 (specified mechanism)**: Stapp's attention-observation model. Clear phenomenal variable, clear physical parameter, explicit causal pathway, testable predictions, some supporting evidence, identified objections with possible responses.

**Tier 2 (partial mechanism)**: Eccles' intention-probability model. Clear phenomenal variable, clear physical parameter, proposed causal pathway, but the pairing problem undermines the pathway's coherence.

**Tier 3 (phenomenological observation without mechanism)**: Valence-motivation, qualia-basis, and unity-entanglement. Each identifies a phenomenal-physical correlation worth investigating, but none specifies how the phenomenal variable produces the physical effect.

This tiering matters for the Map's intellectual honesty. When the Map claims consciousness causally influences physical outcomes, it can point to Stapp's model as a developed (though contested) mechanism. It cannot yet point to a mechanism for how felt valence drives avoidance, or how qualitative character selects measurement bases. These are open problems, not solved ones.

## The Convergence Problem

Even if each candidate mechanism operates independently, a complete coupling law would need to explain how they relate. Consciousness doesn't deploy attention, intention, valence, and qualitative character through separate channels. Willing an action while attending to it while experiencing its felt quality is a unified phenomenon. Any adequate coupling law must eventually address this convergence—how multiple phenomenal dimensions couple to physical selection through a single conscious act.

This convergence problem connects to [phenomenal-unity](/concepts/phenomenal-unity/): the unity of experience may not be decomposable into separate coupling channels. If so, the five-candidate analysis is a useful decomposition for research purposes but may not correspond to how coupling actually works. The coupling law might turn out to be a single principle operating across all phenomenal dimensions, with the five candidates representing different projections of one underlying mechanism.

Such convergence would be theoretically satisfying—it would move toward the "t-shirt problem" solution Chalmers seeks, a compact systematisation rather than an ad hoc list. But it remains speculative. Current understanding permits only piecemeal analysis of separate channels.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The mechanistic landscape has direct implications for the Map's tenets.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)** requires at least one adequate coupling mechanism. Stapp's attention-observation model currently best satisfies the specification threshold—it provides a phenomenal variable (attention/effort), a physical parameter (observation rate), a causal pathway (quantum Zeno effect), and testable predictions. The decoherence objection is serious but not decisive, particularly if the mechanism operates at outcome determination rather than during coherent evolution. The tenet's credibility is tied to the ongoing viability of mechanisms at this level of specificity.

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)** is reflected in the character of all five candidates. Each proposes *biasing* quantum outcomes rather than overriding physical law. Stapp modulates observation frequency; Eccles modulates tunneling probability; none injects energy or violates conservation. The ~10 bits/second bandwidth constraint on conscious processing further enforces minimality—selection operates at the policy level, not the individual-neuron level.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)** makes selection mechanisms meaningful. If all quantum outcomes actualise in parallel branches (as MWI holds), coupling mechanisms have nothing to couple *to*—there's no selection because everything happens. The mechanisms described here assume genuine collapse: consciousness selects one outcome that becomes actual while alternatives are precluded. The debate between collapse interpretations and MWI is therefore not peripheral to the coupling question—it's foundational.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)** applies directly to the t-shirt problem. The absence of a compact coupling law doesn't entail that no law exists. Physics took centuries to reach F=ma; consciousness science is younger. The specification problem may also reflect genuine cognitive limitations—perhaps psychophysical coupling involves concepts our minds aren't built to grasp, in which case the difficulty is epistemological rather than metaphysical.
