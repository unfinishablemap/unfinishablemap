The combination problem does more than embarrass panpsychism. It reveals something deep about the nature of subjectivity: consciousness resists composition. If billions of micro-experiences cannot intelligibly combine into a unified mind, the problem is not merely that panpsychists lack the right mechanism. The problem is that subjectivity—the having of a perspective, the being of a "someone"—may be the sort of thing that cannot be assembled from parts at all. The Unfinishable Map takes this lesson seriously. Where panpsychism and physicalism both attempt to build consciousness from constituents, the Map treats it as ontologically distinct—something that interacts with matter rather than arising from it.

## Why the Problem Runs Deep

The [combination-problem](/concepts/combination-problem/) is often presented as panpsychism's technical difficulty, analogous to the [hard problem](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/) facing physicalism. That framing understates it. The hard problem asks how experience arises from non-experience. The combination problem asks how experience arises from *experience*—and still has no answer.

William James identified the core difficulty in 1890: conscious states are "shut in their own skin, windowless, ignorant of what the other feelings are and mean." Take a hundred feelings, pack them as close together as you can—each remains isolated. James argued that any resultant consciousness would be a "101st feeling," having no intelligible relation to its supposed constituents.

David Chalmers (2017) systematized the problem into three dimensions, each targeting a different aspect of how micro-consciousness would need to become macro-consciousness.

### Subject Combination

How do many experiencing subjects become one? This is the hardest dimension because subjectivity seems inherently *bounded*. A subject is a perspective, and perspectives are defined partly by what they exclude. My visual field is mine because it is not yours. If electron A has a micro-perspective and electron B has another, what could it mean for those perspectives to *merge*?

Sam Coleman (2014) argued this is demonstrably incoherent. If subjects A and B combine into subject C, then either A and B cease to exist—in which case nothing "combined"; something new just appeared—or A, B, and C all coexist, and C is an addition rather than a combination. Philip Goff developed a parallel argument: the "micro-experiential zombie" is conceivable—a being physically identical to a human, whose micro-parts each have experience, yet where no macro-experience exists. If conceivable, micro-facts do not necessitate macro-consciousness.

The conceivability argument here mirrors the [zombie argument](/concepts/philosophical-zombies/) against physicalism. Physicalism cannot close the gap between physical facts and phenomenal facts; panpsychism cannot close the gap between micro-phenomenal facts and macro-phenomenal facts. The [explanatory-gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/) persists at a different level.

### Quality Combination

Human experience is qualitatively rich: the specific blue of a winter sky, the burn of chilli, the texture of anxiety. If electrons have experiences at all, those experiences are presumably extremely simple—perhaps one or two primitive qualities. How does combining a handful of proto-qualities yield the vast palette of human phenomenology?

Chalmers (2017) called this the "palette problem." Responses diverge sharply. Patrick Lewtas (2017) proposes that fundamental reality contains many distinct micro-experiential properties corresponding to basic human qualities—but this amounts to building the answer into the premises. Luke Roelofs (2019) argues we cannot judge micro-qualities as insufficient because we have never experienced them in isolation—our intuitions about their simplicity may be wrong. Keith Turausky (2012) suggests a single fundamental quality might contain all others, as white light contains the spectrum.

None of these is fully satisfying. The palette problem reveals that even granting micro-experience, the *character* of macro-experience remains unexplained.

### Structural Combination

Conscious experience has structure—spatial organisation in vision, temporal flow in audition, the felt boundary between self and world. Physical structure at the micro-level is discrete: particles at locations, neurons firing or not. How does grainy physical composition yield the continuous, unified structure of phenomenal experience?

This is the "grain problem" identified by Grover Maxwell (1979) and Michael Lockwood (1993). My visual field is not pixelated at the neuron level. It feels smooth, continuous, spatially extended. If experience is constituted by discrete micro-experiences at particle locations, why doesn't consciousness feel granular?

Lockwood argued the problem dissolves under contemporary physics, where fields rather than discrete particles are fundamental. Daniel Stoljar (2001) distinguished between the structure of experience and the structure of what experience *represents*—perhaps experience represents continuous space without being spatially continuous itself. These responses have merit, but they highlight rather than resolve the gap between physical microstructure and phenomenal macrostructure.

## Proposed Solutions and Their Limits

### Phenomenal Bonding

Philip Goff proposed a primitive "phenomenal bonding" relation—when micro-experiences stand in this relation, they constitute unified consciousness. The appeal is directness: combination happens because there is a fundamental relation that makes it happen.

The objection is equally direct. Phenomenal bonding names the problem without explaining it. Positing a brute fundamental relation for combination is structurally identical to what panpsychism criticised in physicalism—positing brute emergence. If "experiences combine because they're phenomenally bonded" is acceptable, why not "experience emerges from matter because matter has the right structure"? Panpsychism's motivating insight—that brute emergence is unintelligible—cuts against its own proposed solutions.

### Fusionism

William Seager (2016) and Hedda Hassel Morch (2014, 2018) independently developed "fusionism": when micro-subjects combine, they *fuse* into a macro-subject, ceasing to exist as separate entities. On Seager's version, the resulting brain becomes a "big simple" without experiential parts. On Morch's version, the macro-experience gains metaphysical priority over its micro-experiential origins.

Morch argues this emergence is partially intelligible rather than fully brute—consciousness-from-consciousness is more intelligible than consciousness-from-non-consciousness, even if not fully transparent. This is Strawson's point refined: partial intelligibility is better than none.

Fusionism is the most promising panpsychist response, but it raises questions. If micro-subjects cease to exist upon fusion, the process resembles creation more than combination. New subjectivity appears; old subjectivity vanishes. This is emergence under a different name—constrained, perhaps, by the experiential nature of the constituents, but emergence nonetheless.

### Cosmopsychism

Philip Goff (in later work) and Itay Shani propose inverting the problem entirely. Rather than building consciousness up from micro-experiences, cosmopsychism holds that the universe as a whole is the fundamental conscious subject. Individual minds are not combinations of micro-minds but *dissociations* from cosmic consciousness.

This trades the combination problem for a "decombination problem": how does one cosmic subject fragment into billions of separate perspectives? Gregory Miller (2018) argues this is no easier—we still face subjects as parts of other subjects. Cosmopsychism also inherits a tension with empirical neuroscience: if my consciousness is a fragment of cosmic consciousness, why does it track brain activity so precisely? Why does anaesthesia suppress it? The cosmic mind would need to explain why its fragments correlate with specific neural configurations.

### Eliminating Subjects

The most radical response abandons subjects altogether. If there are no subjects—only consciousness and its contents as fundamental—the subject-summing problem vanishes. Annaka Harris has explored this direction.

But eliminating subjects dissolves the explanandum along with the problem. Consciousness without a subject is consciousness without anyone having it—and panpsychism aimed to respect precisely the datum that *I* have experiences, that there is a *someone* who sees, thinks, feels.

A more sophisticated version comes from Buddhist philosophy, particularly the Madhyamaka tradition. Rather than claiming "consciousness exists but nobody has it," this tradition holds that subjects are *dependently arisen*—real but neither composed from parts nor ontologically primitive. Subjectivity emerges from causes, conditions, and conceptual designation without requiring either a substantial self or micro-experiential building blocks. This represents a genuine third option between panpsychist composition and dualist primitiveness. The Map acknowledges the force of this challenge but maintains that the explanatory work done by "dependent arising" remains opaque: *how* do causes and conditions give rise to a perspective, if not by composition? The question shifts but does not vanish. [Contemplative traditions](/topics/the-observer-witness-in-meditation/) report states where the sense of self attenuates while experience persists—but even these reports presuppose *someone* reporting.

### Panprotopsychism

Chalmers (2015) distinguished panpsychism from panprotopsychism: perhaps fundamental entities have not proto-*experience* but proto-*experiential* properties—non-phenomenal properties that transparently constitute phenomenal properties in combination. Electrons lack experience but possess something that yields experience when appropriately organised.

This avoids the combination problem as stated (no micro-experiences to combine), but faces a "revenge" version: if protophenomenal properties are non-experiential, "protophenomenal zombies" seem conceivable—systems with all the protophenomenal properties but no experience. The conceivability argument that motivates panpsychism against physicalism returns to undermine panprotopsychism. The gap between the non-experiential and the experiential reappears.

## What the Problem Reveals

The combination problem's persistence across every proposed solution suggests something philosophically important: subjectivity may be *inherently non-compositional*.

Physical properties compose readily. Two masses combine into a larger mass. Two charges superpose. Two velocities add (relativistic corrections aside). But two perspectives do not combine into a third. Two experiential viewpoints do not merge into a wider viewpoint. This asymmetry between physical composition and phenomenal composition is the combination problem's deepest lesson.

If consciousness cannot be composed from parts—whether those parts are non-experiential (physicalism's problem) or experiential (panpsychism's problem)—then perhaps consciousness is not the sort of thing that has compositional structure at all. This points toward treating consciousness as ontologically basic: not assembled, not decomposable, but *primitive*.

A materialist might object that other phenomena resist compositional explanation without being ontologically distinct—turbulence, for instance, cannot be predicted from individual fluid molecules. But the analogy fails at a crucial point. Turbulence is *structurally* difficult: we lack the computational power to derive macro-behaviour from micro-behaviour, but there is no in-principle gap between fluid mechanics and turbulent flow. The combination problem is *conceptual*: we cannot even formulate what it would mean for two perspectives to merge, regardless of computational resources. The difficulty is not that combination is hard to model but that it is hard to *conceive*. This is why the combination problem more closely resembles the [hard problem](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/) than it resembles any problem in physics.

A [mysterian](/concepts/mysterianism/) alternative deserves acknowledgment: perhaps the combination problem reveals the limits of human cognition rather than the structure of reality. We may lack the conceptual resources to understand phenomenal composition, just as we may lack the resources to understand consciousness-matter interaction. The Map accepts this possibility in principle—but notes that the mysterian move applies equally to every theory, and a framework that faces an *empirically approachable* mystery (interaction) is preferable to one facing a *purely conceptual* mystery (combination).

The Map draws exactly this conclusion. The [Dualism tenet](/tenets/#dualism) holds that consciousness is irreducible to physical processes. The combination problem reinforces this by showing that consciousness is equally irreducible to *experiential* processes. Reduction fails in both directions. Consciousness is fundamental—not as the intrinsic nature of all matter, but as a distinct category.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The combination problem strengthens the Map's position in several ways.

**Dualism gains by elimination.** Both physicalism and panpsychism attempt to derive consciousness from constituents: non-experiential constituents in one case, experiential in the other. Both face structurally similar explanatory gaps. [Interactionist dualism](/concepts/interactionist-dualism/) avoids both gaps by treating consciousness as ontologically distinct. There is nothing to combine because consciousness is not composed.

**The interaction problem is differently structured.** Dualism's classic challenge—how do distinct substances causally interact?—is formidable (see [princess-elizabeths-challenge](/topics/princess-elizabeths-challenge/)), but it is at least the sort of problem where empirical discoveries about quantum measurement, neural correlates, and [quantum brain models](/concepts/stapp-quantum-mind/) could bear on potential answers. The [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) tenet proposes that consciousness biases quantum indeterminacies—a hypothesis constrained by physics even if not yet directly tested. The combination problem, by contrast, is conceptual: we cannot formulate what it would mean for micro-experiences to merge, regardless of what experiments reveal.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)** applies directly. Panpsychism appeared simpler than dualism—one kind of stuff rather than two. But the combination problem demonstrates that apparent simplicity conceals deep complexity. Monism about substance does not yield simplicity about explanation.

**Phenomenal unity as primitive.** The Map's framework treats [phenomenal-unity](/concepts/phenomenal-unity/) as a feature of consciousness itself, not an achievement of physical combination. The combination problem shows why: if unity cannot be built from parts (whether physical or experiential), it must be intrinsic to consciousness. This aligns with the [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet—consciousness brings its own unity to the neural processes it influences, rather than borrowing unity from physical organisation. Treating unity as primitive is a genuine philosophical cost—it declines to explain something that seems to demand explanation. But the combination problem shows that every attempt at explanation either smuggles in unexplained unity (phenomenal bonding), relabels emergence (fusionism), or dissolves the phenomenon (eliminating subjects). Accepting primitiveness honestly is preferable to concealing it behind a mechanism that does not actually work.

The Map recognises what panpsychism gets right: consciousness is fundamental, emergence from non-conscious matter is unintelligible, the hard problem is genuine. The disagreement concerns *how* consciousness is fundamental. Panpsychism distributes it across all matter and faces the combination problem. The Map concentrates it as a distinct category that interacts with matter at specifiable points—and faces the interaction problem instead. The combination problem's depth and persistence suggest the Map's trade is the more promising one—though the interaction problem's own difficulties remain to be fully resolved.
