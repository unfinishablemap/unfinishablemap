Free will is the capacity to have done otherwise—to be the genuine author of one's choices rather than a puppet of prior causes. The Unfinishable Map's framework offers a distinctive position: consciousness genuinely influences physical outcomes through quantum-level selection, and [retrocausal](/concepts/retrocausality/) mechanisms may explain how this works without violating temporal ordering.

## The Traditional Problem

Classical physics suggested determinism: given initial conditions and physical laws, all future states follow necessarily. This presents three options:

**Hard Determinism**: Free will is an illusion. Our choices are determined by prior causes stretching back to the Big Bang.

**Libertarian Free Will**: We possess a capacity to initiate causal chains not fully determined by prior physical states. The Map's framework is [agent-causal](/concepts/agent-causation/)—consciousness is the source of action, not merely a link in event chains. Agent causation requires [substance dualism](/tenets/#dualism): consciousness must be a persisting substance capable of exercising causal powers, not merely a property of physical systems.

**Compatibilism**: Free will is compatible with determinism because "free" means acting from your own desires without external coercion. Yet this leaves untouched the question: could the person who "chose" their desires have chosen otherwise?

## The Neuroscientific Challenge

[Benjamin Libet's experiments](/concepts/libet-experiments/) found that neural "readiness potentials" precede conscious awareness of deciding to move by about 350 milliseconds. Does this mean consciousness merely observes choices already made?

But the data admits other interpretations. [Schurger et al. (2012)](/concepts/libet-experiments/#the-neural-noise-critique) proposed that the readiness potential reflects spontaneous neural fluctuations rather than decision preparation. Libet himself argued consciousness retains "veto power"—the ability to cancel prepared actions. The dedicated [libet-experiments](/concepts/libet-experiments/) article examines these debates in detail.

## Quantum Indeterminacy and the Luck Objection

Quantum mechanics isn't deterministic—measurement collapses superpositions to outcomes physics doesn't determine. But critics argue quantum randomness gives us random will, not free will. This is the [luck objection](/concepts/luck-objection/): if choices are undetermined, what makes them the agent's rather than arbitrary fluctuations?

The Map proposes that consciousness *selects* outcomes rather than merely receiving them:

| Feature | Random Indeterminism | Consciousness-Selected Indeterminism |
|---------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| What determines outcome | Nothing (pure chance) | The agent, based on reasons |
| Phenomenology | None | Effort, engagement |
| Agent's relationship | Passive recipient | Active selector |

If selection is genuine, the luck objection fails. The selection responds to what matters to the agent (values, goals), involves the [phenomenology of effort](/concepts/mental-effort/), and shows distinctive [neural signatures](/concepts/voluntary-attention/). The agent explains the difference. See [quantum-indeterminacy-free-will](/concepts/quantum-indeterminacy-free-will/) for comprehensive treatment.

## The Map's Position: Consciousness Selects Quantum Outcomes

The Map's commitment to [interactionist-dualism](/archive/arguments/interactionist-dualism/) provides the philosophical foundation. The [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet holds that consciousness causally influences the physical world. Combined with [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction), this suggests:

1. The brain prepares multiple possible action patterns (superposed neural states)
2. Consciousness selects which pattern becomes actual
3. This selection reflects genuine choice, not randomness
4. The selection works with what physics allows, not against it

Free will operates through the gap quantum mechanics leaves open. Consciousness doesn't violate physical laws; it determines outcomes physics leaves undetermined.

### The Decoherence Challenge

Quantum superpositions are fragile—interaction with the environment causes them to "decohere" almost instantly. This is a serious challenge, but not fatal. Biological quantum effects (avian magnetoreception, photosynthesis) demonstrate evolution can optimise quantum coherence. Decoherence doesn't solve the measurement problem—even after decoherence, what explains why *this* outcome rather than another? The [quantum Zeno mechanism](/concepts/quantum-consciousness/) operates through rapid repeated observation, not sustained coherence. See [decoherence](/concepts/decoherence/) for detailed analysis.

### The Temporal Problem: Retrocausality

If consciousness selects which neural pattern becomes actual, shouldn't this selection precede the neural preparation? [Retrocausal](/concepts/retrocausality/) interpretations offer resolution. The fundamental equations of quantum mechanics are time-symmetric. Cramer's transactional interpretation proposes that quantum events involve "handshakes" that are atemporal—they determine which temporal sequence becomes real.

If consciousness operates at this level, the apparent timing problem dissolves. The readiness potential isn't evidence that neural activity precedes choice—it's part of the selected history.

## Agent Causation: Why This Framework Is Libertarian

The Map's position is that free will requires [agent causation](/concepts/agent-causation/). Event-causal libertarianism holds that mental events cause actions nondeterministically. But if my decision is caused by prior mental events I didn't choose, how am I the *ultimate* source?

Agent causation answers differently. The agent—as a persisting substance—directly causes action. Roderick Chisholm distinguished *transeunt* causation (event→event) from *immanent* causation (agent→event). When I decide to raise my hand, *I* caused the raising—not "a decision event."

The [phenomenology of choice](/concepts/phenomenology-of-choice/) supports this picture: the felt openness of options during deliberation, the moment of resolution when alternatives collapse to actuality, and the sense of authorship that follows. These experiential signatures fit agent causation better than event-causation or epiphenomenalism.

### Against Epiphenomenalism

Free will requires [mental-causation](/concepts/mental-causation/). [Epiphenomenalism](/arguments/epiphenomenalism/) faces self-stultification: if conscious states have no causal influence, your belief that you're conscious isn't caused by actually being conscious. Any argument *against* mental causation must reach your beliefs through causally inert consciousness—which means it doesn't reach them at all.

The [argument-from-reason](/topics/argument-from-reason/) provides a complementary line: if all beliefs are fully explained by nonrational physical causes, then no belief is rationally justified, including the belief in physicalism.

## Neural Evidence for Selection

Research on [voluntary attention](/concepts/voluntary-attention/) reveals that willed action engages distinct neural mechanisms from automatic behaviour:

| Type | Trigger | Phenomenology | Neural Signature |
|------|---------|---------------|------------------|
| Automatic | External salience | Passive, being captured | Ventral attention network |
| Instructed | External cues | Following directions | Unidirectional coherence |
| Willed | Internal decision | Effortful, self-directed | Frontal theta, bidirectional coherence |

The brain distinguishes between doing what you're told and doing what you choose. If consciousness were epiphenomenal, why would neural signatures track phenomenology?

[Motor control](/concepts/motor-selection/) shows the same selection architecture. The parallel suggests a unified mechanism—consciousness selecting wherever the brain provides the right interface.

## Free Will and Personal Identity

Free will is intimately connected to [personal-identity](/topics/personal-identity/). The [No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds) tenet emphasizes indexical identity: *this* conscious being matters. When you make a choice, *you* made it—not just "a choice was made somewhere in the multiverse."

If the Map is right—if you are an unrepeatable conscious being with a unique causal history of quantum selections—then your choices are genuinely *yours*. Each decision adds to a particular causal chain that constitutes your life.

If agents genuinely author choices, [moral responsibility](/concepts/moral-responsibility/) gains metaphysical grounding. Desert becomes more than a useful social fiction—it tracks something real about who caused what.

## What Would Challenge This Framework?

**Decisive neural determinism**: If decisions could be predicted with >95% accuracy at quantum-relevant timescales, this would undermine quantum selection. Current accuracy (~60%) leaves room for indeterminacy.

**Solving the hard problem materialistically**: A complete account of why physical processes give rise to subjective experience would weaken the motivation for dualism.

**Many-Worlds confirmation**: If experiments confirmed quantum measurements branch rather than collapse, the selection framework would need radical revision.

**Phenomenology-neuroscience dissociation**: If effort phenomenology stopped correlating with neural activity patterns, the correlation supporting bidirectional interaction would break down.

The framework is not unfalsifiable. It makes commitments that empirical findings could undermine.

## The Picture That Emerges

The brain prepares a superposition of possible action patterns. Consciousness—operating atemporally at the quantum level—selects which possibility becomes actual. This selection propagates both forward and backward, determining which neural history becomes real.

From inside linear time, it looks like the brain "decided" before consciousness became aware. But the linear ordering is itself part of what was selected.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Free will stands at the intersection of all five tenets:

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: Genuine authorship requires consciousness to be something more than physical processes—capable of contributing what physics alone doesn't determine.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)**: Free will requires that consciousness *cause* physical outcomes. The quantum selection mechanism specifies how.

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)**: Consciousness operates within what physics allows—selecting among quantum possibilities without violating any physical equation.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)**: Selection requires real collapse. If all possibilities actualize in branching worlds, consciousness selects nothing. The phenomenology of choice involves *determining* which outcome becomes actual, not merely *discovering* which branch you're in.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)**: Determinism seems simpler but fails to explain the phenomenology of effort, the willed/instructed neural distinction, and the correlation between conscious engagement and neuroplasticity.
