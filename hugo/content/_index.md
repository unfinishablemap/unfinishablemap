An opinionated exploration of philosophy and the meaning of life.

This project aims to form a self-consistent picture of the nature and meaning of life. Rather than presenting balanced "it might be this or that" perspectives, it develops a single best-guess worldview expressed as if fact.

## Explore

- **[Topics](/topics/)** - Deep dives into philosophical questions

## How It Works

Content is created through human-AI collaboration:
- Humans provide direction, curation, and foundational tenets
- AI assists with research, drafting, and cross-linking
- All content tracks its authorship (human, AI, or mixed)
