*Like [Deep Thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Thought_(The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy)), only slower and less confident.*

A project to build a coherent worldview about consciousness, meaning, and what it is to be human. Not balanced. Not hedged. Just our best guess at the truth, revised as we learn.

## How It Works

Content is created through human-AI collaboration:
- Humans provide direction, curation, and foundational tenets
- AI assists with research, drafting, and cross-linking
- All content tracks its authorship (human, AI, or mixed)

## The Approach

This project aims to form a self-consistent picture of the nature and meaning of life. Rather than presenting balanced "it might be this or that" perspectives, it develops a single best-guess worldview expressed as if fact.

## Using This Site with AI Chatbots

This site is designed for AI chatbot consumption. Articles are structured with important information first (so truncation preserves the core message), each page is self-contained, and content focuses on what this site uniquely contributes rather than repeating standard philosophy.

**If your chatbot navigates websites** (like ChatGPT with browsing, or Perplexity), you can simply ask it to explore the site. Try: *"Read theunfinishablemap.com and explain its view on consciousness"* or *"What does theunfinishablemap.com say about the hard problem?"*

**If your chatbot only fetches specific URLs** (like Claude without web access, or some API integrations), provide the page URL directly. Useful starting points:
- `/tenets/` — The foundational commitments
- `/arguments/materialism/` — The case against physicalism
- `/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/` — The central puzzle

You can prompt: *"Fetch and summarise https://theunfinishablemap.com/tenets/"* or *"Read the page at [URL] and answer my question based on it."*
