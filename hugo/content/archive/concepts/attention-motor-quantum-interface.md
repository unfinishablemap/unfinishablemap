The attention-motor quantum interface is the hypothesized unified neural substrate where consciousness influences brain states. The Unfinishable Map proposes that attention and motor planning share the same neural mechanisms—and that this shared substrate is where consciousness selects among quantum possibilities through the [quantum Zeno effect](/concepts/stapp-quantum-mind/). Rather than two separate interfaces (one for perception, one for action), consciousness operates through a single selection mechanism that the brain divides only functionally.

This unification has substantial empirical support. The premotor theory of attention demonstrates that spatial attention and motor preparation use identical neural circuits. Willed attention and willed action share the same neural signatures: frontal theta oscillations, ~280-300ms deployment timing, and bidirectional frontoparietal coherence. If consciousness contributes to selection in one domain, the mechanism should operate identically in the other.

## The Premotor Theory of Attention

Giacomo Rizzolatti's premotor theory of attention (PMTA) provides the empirical foundation. The core claim: selective attention and movement planning use the same neural substrates—there is no independent attention system.

Evidence supporting this claim:

- The same fronto-parietal networks activate during spatial attention shifts and motor preparation
- Preparing an eye movement to location X improves visual processing at X—attention *is* the motor preparation
- Microstimulation of motor regions enhances visual processing at the movement target
- Attempts to identify attention regions independent of motor planning consistently fail

If PMTA is correct, the distinction between "attending to X" and "preparing to orient toward X" is artificial. What feels like directing attention is actually preparing action.

PMTA's proponents (Rizzolatti and colleagues) do not endorse dualist interpretations. The Map's extension—that this unified substrate serves as consciousness's interface with the brain—is an application of their empirical findings, not a consequence they would accept.

## Neural Architecture of Selection

### Affordance Competition

Paul Cisek's affordance competition hypothesis describes the architecture that enables selection:

1. **Parallel specification**: Sensory input automatically specifies multiple potential actions. Seeing a cup activates reaching, grasping, and ignoring options simultaneously.

2. **Neural competition**: These potential actions compete within neural populations. Cisek and Kalaska (2005) found 43% of task-related cells in dorsal premotor cortex discharged for *either* of two potential reach targets—encoding both options simultaneously.

3. **Threshold crossing**: Decision occurs when one competing population reaches threshold, emerging from nonlinear dynamics between populations biased by contextual factors.

4. **Winner-take-all**: The winning action executes while competitors are suppressed.

This architecture provides a precise locus for quantum selection. During competition, multiple action representations exist simultaneously. At threshold crossing, one becomes actual.

### The 280-300ms Window

Two lines of research converge on a shared timing window:

- **Motor commitment**: Thura and Cisek (2014) identified that approximately 280ms before movement onset, activity for the selected target peaks while the unselected target is suppressed—"volitional commitment to an action choice"
- **Willed attention**: Bengson et al. (2019) found that willed attention takes ~300ms to deploy, accompanied by distinctive frontal theta oscillations

This timing match supports unified mechanism. If attention and motor selection were independent systems operating through different interfaces, why would they share the same timeline?

### Dopamine and Threshold Modulation

The [dopamine-selection-interface](/concepts/motor-selection/) illuminates how the brain prepares options for selection. A 2024 *Nature* study demonstrated that dopamine-deficient mice "can move" but "won't move"—motor circuitry remains intact but goal-directed initiative is lost. Dopamine modulates the *decision threshold* at which competing options resolve, not motor capacity itself.

This suggests a three-layer architecture:

1. **Neural computation** generates competing options (preserved without dopamine)
2. **Dopamine** sets threshold sensitivity and marks options as salient
3. **Consciousness** (via quantum selection) determines which option crosses threshold

The architecture satisfies the [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) tenet: consciousness doesn't inject energy—it biases which accumulating option wins the threshold race.

## The Quantum Zeno Mechanism

[Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism](/concepts/stapp-quantum-mind/) proposes that mental attention operates like quantum observation. Rapid, repeated "looks" at neural states hold desired patterns stable against their tendency to evolve into alternatives.

If attention is motor planning (PMTA), then the Zeno mechanism applies directly to motor selection. The same rapid observation that sustains attention to a visual target sustains preparation for a reaching movement. The unified mechanism:

1. **Neural superposition**: Multiple motor programs compete (classical analog: simultaneous neural representations)
2. **Attentional observation**: Directing attention constitutes observation of that neural state
3. **Zeno stabilization**: Repeated observation prevents the selected plan from dissipating
4. **Threshold facilitation**: Sustained attention biases which population reaches threshold first

This explains the common phenomenology. Sustaining motor intention feels effortful for the same reason sustaining attention feels effortful: both require continuous engagement to maintain Zeno freezing. See [mental-effort](/concepts/mental-effort/) for detailed treatment of effort phenomenology.

## Neural Signatures

Three markers distinguish willed from automatic selection in both domains:

| Signature | Attention Evidence | Motor Evidence |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Frontal theta** | Willed attention produces theta oscillations absent in instructed attention (Bengson 2019) | Willed movement shows frontal theta increase before action |
| **Bidirectional coherence** | Theta-band coherence between frontal and parietal regions is bidirectional during willed attention | Motor selection shows bidirectional information flow during genuine deliberation |
| **Additional frontal recruitment** | Willed attention engages frontal regions beyond instructed attention | Voluntary action engages prefrontal regions that automatic responses bypass |

The parallel signatures suggest that what feels like "you deciding" in both domains reflects the same underlying process—consciousness engaging with the selection mechanism.

## Relation to Site Perspective

### Dualism

The unified interface supports the [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism) tenet. If willed attention and willed action both feel like *you* doing something—not like watching computation unfold—this suggests a common agent engaging with both domains. The neural dissociations (parietal intention vs. premotor execution; willed vs. instructed signatures) indicate something contributes that is not identical to the execution machinery.

### Bidirectional Interaction

The attention-motor interface exemplifies [bidirectional interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction). Through motor selection, consciousness visibly affects the physical world—words appear on screens, bodies move through space. If attention and motor selection share a mechanism, the same interface connects consciousness to both perception and action.

### Minimal Quantum Interaction

The interface satisfies [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) constraints. Consciousness doesn't generate motor force—it biases selection among patterns the brain already generates. The bandwidth constraint (~10 bits/second for conscious processing) matches policy-level operation: you consciously select "reach for the cup," not the firing patterns of individual motor neurons.

### No Many Worlds

The quantum Zeno mechanism requires genuine collapse. Under [many-worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds), there's nothing to select—motor programs would execute in all branches, and consciousness would merely find itself in one. Single-world interpretation preserves motor selection as genuine choice.

### An Honest Gap

This framework identifies *where* consciousness might influence brain states—at the unified attention-motor substrate where competing options resolve. It does not explain *how* a non-physical consciousness biases physical outcomes. The interface is located, not illuminated. This distinguishes the Map's position from both eliminativism (which denies the problem) and facile solutions (which claim to solve what they merely relocate).

## Challenges and Responses

**Decoherence objection**: If the interface involves quantum processes, how can coherence survive in warm neural tissue? The debate remains open: Tegmark estimated decoherence times of 10⁻¹³ to 10⁻²⁰ seconds, while Hameroff (2014) argues revised calculations yield 10⁻⁵ to 10⁻⁴ seconds—though these address different mechanisms and neither has secured consensus. Importantly, Stapp's Zeno mechanism doesn't require sustained coherence—each attentional "observation" constitutes a rapid measurement collapsing the wavefunction before decoherence acts. See [quantum-neural-timing-constraints](/topics/quantum-neural-timing-constraints/) for the full timing hierarchy.

**Libet challenge**: The [libet-experiments](/concepts/libet-experiments/) found neural preparation precedes conscious awareness. Schurger's 2012 model reframes this: the readiness potential may be averaged stochastic noise, not unconscious decision. What consciousness contributes is determining *when to allow* threshold-crossing—selection among options the brain presents.

**Neural dynamics sufficiency**: Perhaps competition and threshold-crossing are fully explicable through classical neural dynamics. Response: if competition is deterministic, deliberation is theatre. If genuinely indeterminate, something must resolve the indeterminacy. Pure randomness produces arbitrary selection, not *choice*. For outcomes to be both undetermined and meaningful, something beyond neural dynamics must bias which option actualizes.
