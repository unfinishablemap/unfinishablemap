Knowing that you know is not the same as knowing. Metarepresentation—representing your own representations as representations—requires a distinctive cognitive operation that may depend on phenomenal consciousness. Great apes possess knowledge but may not know they possess it. Humans not only know; we know that we know, and can take our knowledge as an object of further thought. This metarepresentational capacity underpins cumulative culture, explicit reasoning, and deliberate self-improvement. If metarepresentation requires phenomenal consciousness, it provides strong evidence for the [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet: consciousness doesn't merely accompany cognition but enables cognitive capacities that would otherwise be impossible.

The Unfinishable Map proposes that the human-great ape intelligence gap tracks consciousness-dependent capacities. Metarepresentation may be the clearest example: a cognitive operation requiring you to stand back from your own mental states, recognise them *as* mental states, and operate on them as objects. This "standing back" appears to require the kind of phenomenal distance that consciousness provides.

## What Metarepresentation Is

Metarepresentation involves three nested levels:

1. **First-order representation**: Representing the world (e.g., knowing there are nuts in the tree)
2. **Second-order representation**: Representing your first-order representations (e.g., believing that you know there are nuts in the tree)
3. **Metarepresentation proper**: Representing your representations *as* representations—knowing that your belief is a belief, that your knowledge is knowledge, that your perception might differ from reality

The third level is crucial. Many animals show evidence of second-order states: uncertainty monitoring, strategic information-seeking, adjusting confidence. But these might operate procedurally—functional states that guide behaviour without explicit representation of themselves as mental states. Metarepresentation requires treating your mental states as the kind of thing that *can* be represented, examined, and evaluated.

The [phenomenology of deliberate choice](/concepts/phenomenology-of-choice/) illustrates this structure. When you genuinely choose between options, you represent your possible actions as possible actions—not merely act on the strongest impulse but stand back from the options, recognise them as alternatives you could take, and select among them. This choosing-as-metarepresentation distinguishes human deliberation from sophisticated animal behaviour. The ape may have preferences; the human recognises having preferences and can take them as objects of further evaluation.

### Theory of Mind Levels

[Theory of mind](/concepts/theory-of-mind/) admits of levels with increasing metarepresentational demands:

- **Level 1 (Perception Attribution)**: Understanding what others see. Great apes pass these tests, but may operate through geometric tracking without representing perceptual states *as* mental states.
- **Level 2 (Belief Attribution)**: Understanding that others have beliefs differing from reality. To predict action on a *false* belief, you must represent their belief as a belief—a representation that could be wrong.
- **Level 3+ (Recursive Mindreading)**: "She thinks that I think..." Nested attribution requires representing others' metarepresentations while keeping levels distinct.

The hierarchy maps onto working memory demands. The human-great ape gap in working memory capacity—humans can maintain around four items in working memory (Cowan 2001), while great apes are limited to roughly two (Read 2008)—may explain where the metarepresentational threshold falls. Great apes show robust Level 1 and contested Level 2, but no clear Level 3—suggesting the threshold lies precisely where consciousness-dependent operations begin.

### Teaching as Paradigm Case

[Teaching](/concepts/teaching-as-metarepresentation/) requires simultaneously maintaining nested representational levels: knowing something, knowing that you know, representing the learner's knowledge state, representing the gap between your knowledge and their ignorance, and adjusting behaviour to bridge that gap. Without knowing that you know, you cannot recognise that another doesn't know what you know.

Great apes rarely if ever teach in this sense. Despite sophisticated social learning, chimpanzee mothers do not slow demonstrations, highlight key features, or adjust based on the learner's developing understanding. Learning happens through tolerated scrounging rather than deliberate transmission—suggesting metarepresentation is the limiting factor.

### The Jourdain Hypothesis

Andrew Whiten (2015) articulates the Jourdain Hypothesis: great apes may have culture—tool-use traditions, grooming patterns—but not *know* they have culture, like Molière's character who discovered he had been speaking prose without knowing it.

The [baseline-cognition](/concepts/baseline-cognition/) framework elaborates this. Great apes possess procedural metacognition (feelings that guide behaviour) without declarative metacognition (explicit knowledge of mental states). The difference between having mental states and representing oneself as having them marks the boundary between baseline and consciousness-amplified cognition.

Cumulative culture requires metarepresentation. To improve a tool, you must represent the tool-making process *as a process* that could be done differently. Without this, cultural accumulation stalls—each generation learns what the previous knew, but cannot systematically improve upon it.

### Tip-of-the-Tongue Evidence

The tip-of-the-tongue (TOT) phenomenon demonstrates metarepresentation directly. During TOT states, you know you know something without retrieving it—and can assess features of the unretrieved knowledge (its length, first letter) despite lacking access to the knowledge itself.

This layered structure cannot be merely procedural: you represent your knowledge state, represent properties of that knowledge, and represent the relationship between current access and the knowledge itself. The distinctive [phenomenology](/concepts/cognitive-phenomenology/) of TOT states—the qualitative character of knowing-about-knowing—may be what metarepresentation requires.

## Why Metarepresentation May Require Consciousness

### The Self-as-Object Problem

To represent your representations as representations, you must take yourself as object—but the self doing the representing is the same self being represented. This requires doubled awareness: being aware *of* your mental states while being aware *as* the subject having them.

Phenomenal consciousness provides this structure. Conscious experience involves both content (what you're aware of) and the fact of awareness itself. Without this, metarepresentation seems incoherent: what would represent the representations if not an aware subject? [Higher-Order Thought](/concepts/higher-order-theories/) theories may inadvertently confirm that metarepresentation presupposes consciousness rather than explaining it.

### The Binding Requirement

Metarepresentation requires holding multiple representations in relation—the representation, the representation of it, and their relationship—demanding phenomenal unity. Metarepresentational tasks load heavily on working memory, and if working memory depends on conscious access (as [Global Workspace Theory](/concepts/global-workspace-theory/) proposes), metarepresentation inherits this dependence.

Great apes' limited working memory capacity may explain their metarepresentational limitations. The expansion enabling human metarepresentation may be the expansion of conscious workspace.

### Epistemic Phenomenology

[Epistemic emotions](/concepts/epistemic-emotions/)—the feeling of certainty, doubt, insight, tip-of-tongue frustration—have phenomenal character. They concern your relationship to knowledge rather than the world directly. This phenomenal dimension may be constitutive: without the felt quality, there might be no genuine metarepresentation, only functional processing that mimics it.

## Comparative Evidence

### Great Ape Metacognition

Great apes show sophisticated metacognition: uncertainty monitoring, strategic information-seeking, mirror self-recognition. But this metacognition appears procedural—functional states influencing behaviour without explicit representation of themselves as mental states. Evidence: no teaching, no cumulative culture, limited theory of mind beyond Level 1.

### Human Development

Metarepresentational capacities develop gradually: joint attention (18-24 months), false-belief understanding (3-4 years), explicit understanding that beliefs can be false (4-5 years), understanding knowledge as representation (6-7 years). This trajectory mirrors the emergence of explicit consciousness—children become explicitly aware of their own minds.

### The Dissociation Pattern

Sophisticated information processing can occur without metarepresentation, but metarepresentation requires something more. Great apes process information flexibly and monitor uncertainty, yet lack the ability to represent their knowledge as knowledge. This dissociation suggests metarepresentation requires a qualitatively different capacity that consciousness provides.

## The Illusionist Challenge

[Illusionists](/concepts/illusionism/) might argue that metarepresentation is merely functional processing generating the *illusion* of knowing-that-you-know. This faces the characteristic regress: for metarepresentation to *seem* phenomenally significant, something must experience that seeming. The illusion of metarepresentation would itself require a subject to be fooled.

Keith Frankish's quasi-phenomenal account creates a specific problem here. When you "know that you know," you would need: (1) a first-order state, (2) a quasi-phenomenal representation of that state, and (3) a *further* quasi-phenomenal representation of that quasi-phenomenal state. But what makes level (3) seem like genuine knowing-that-you-know rather than mere functional self-monitoring? The framework generates the very metarepresentational structure it was meant to explain.

The regress sharpens: either quasi-phenomenal properties are themselves phenomenally conscious (undermining illusionism), or they aren't (leaving unexplained why metarepresentation feels like anything). The illusion of metarepresentation would require metarepresenting the illusion.

## Contemplative Evidence

[Witness consciousness](/concepts/witness-consciousness/) practices explicitly cultivate metarepresentational capacity—observing mental contents without identification. This "witnessing" is precisely metarepresentation: representing your representations as objects within awareness. The instruction is never "process your mental states differently" but "observe your mental states"—observation implies a conscious observer.

Experienced meditators report a characteristic shift: thoughts come to be experienced as events within awareness rather than as the voice of the self. This phenomenology cannot reduce to functional changes, because the functional benefits (reduced reactivity, increased flexibility) depend on the phenomenal change (experiencing thoughts as objects).

## What Would Challenge This View?

Several findings would weaken the consciousness-metarepresentation link:

1. **Great apes demonstrating explicit metarepresentation**—representing beliefs as beliefs, not merely acting on them strategically
2. **Metarepresentation without TOT phenomenology**—patients losing the felt quality while retaining functional metarepresentation
3. **AI achieving genuine metarepresentation** while lacking consciousness—though demonstrating non-consciousness faces severe epistemic challenges, an AI that metarepresented without any plausible consciousness markers would weaken the link
4. **Dissociation in humans**—intact phenomenal consciousness with impaired metarepresentation, or vice versa

Current evidence shows consciousness and metarepresentation co-varying rather than dissociating.

## Relation to Site Perspective

### Dualism

The [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism) tenet asserts consciousness is irreducible to physical processes. If metarepresentation requires something over and above functional processing—the "standing back" that consciousness provides—then metarepresentation itself evidences consciousness's irreducibility.

### Bidirectional Interaction

The [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet claims consciousness causally influences the physical world. Metarepresentation provides a specific mechanism: consciousness enables organisms to represent their own representations and deliberately improve their cognitive processes. Without this, cumulative culture, explicit reasoning, and deliberate self-improvement are impossible—exactly what bidirectional interaction predicts.

### Minimal Quantum Interaction

The [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) tenet proposes consciousness influences neural states through quantum selection. Metarepresentation requires binding multiple representational levels into unified awareness. The quantum Zeno framework offers a mechanism: through sustained attention, consciousness might maintain coherence across the neural substrates of different representational levels. This account faces the standard [decoherence objection](/concepts/decoherence/), but identifies where empirical investigation must focus.

### No Many Worlds

The [No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds) tenet rejects interpretations where consciousness fragments across branches. Metarepresentation presupposes a unified subject: *I* represent *my* representations. If consciousness branches between having a belief (t1) and representing it as a belief (t2), the indexical "I" in "I know that I know" cannot coherently refer to multiple branch-descendants simultaneously.

### Occam's Razor Has Limits

The [Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits) tenet cautions against premature parsimony. The simplest explanation—that metarepresentation is merely more complex information processing—fails to explain why it correlates with expanded consciousness and distinguishes humans from great apes despite comparable neural complexity.
