Temporal unity is the phenomenal property by which successive moments of experience belong to a single, continuous stream rather than occurring as disconnected instants. The Unfinishable Map distinguishes it from [synchronic unity](/concepts/varieties-of-unity/) (which binds features within a moment) and [subject unity](/concepts/varieties-of-unity/) (which establishes who experiences). Temporal unity answers a specific question: what makes experience *flow*? Without it, consciousness would be a series of vivid snapshots with nothing connecting one to the next. Temporal unity is what makes a melody more than a sequence of tones and a thought more than a series of unrelated mental states.

## What Temporal Unity Is

Temporal unity—also called diachronic unity—is the binding of experience across time. It has several distinguishing marks:

**Experienced succession, not mere succession of experiences.** When you hear three notes forming a chord progression, the progression itself is experienced. A system that processed each note separately, with no phenomenal carryover, would never experience progression—only isolated tones. Temporal unity is what transforms serial processing into felt continuity.

**Retention and protention.** Husserl's analysis identifies the internal structure of temporal unity. Each moment of experience contains *retention* (the just-past echoing in awareness with a distinctive "just-gone" character), *primal impression* (the present), and *protention* (anticipation of the about-to-arrive). These are not three separate experiences glued together but aspects of one unified temporal field. Retention differs from both perception and memory—it has its own phenomenal character, a kind of fading presence that standard accounts of information storage cannot capture.

**The [specious present](/concepts/temporal-consciousness/) as its domain.** Temporal unity operates primarily within the specious present—the window within which succession appears as a unified whole. Estimates of its duration vary: the core perceptual window spans roughly 100 to 750 milliseconds, though broader measures extend to 2–3 seconds (see [temporal-consciousness](/concepts/temporal-consciousness/) for the full range of estimates). This window is not a computational artefact but the span across which temporal unity constitutively operates. Events within the specious present are temporally unified; events outside it are remembered, which is a different relation entirely.

## Temporal Unity vs. Related Concepts

The Map's content addresses several phenomena in the neighbourhood of temporal unity. Their relationships:

**[Unity of consciousness](/concepts/unity-of-consciousness/)** is the broader category. Temporal unity is one dimension—alongside synchronic unity and subject unity—of the overall unity that experience exhibits. The unity of consciousness article treats all three; this article focuses on the temporal dimension alone.

**[Temporal consciousness](/concepts/temporal-consciousness/)** concerns the full range of ways consciousness relates to time: the specious present, Bergson's durée, temporal binding in the brain, AI implications, and the metaphysics of time. Temporal unity is a specific property within this broader territory—the property of being unified across time rather than fragmented.

**[The binding problem](/concepts/binding-problem/)** typically concerns spatial or feature binding: how colour and shape unite at a moment. Temporal unity is binding's temporal counterpart—how the note just heard and the note now sounding unite into a phrase. The mechanisms may differ: gamma synchrony addresses spatial binding, while retention-protention structure addresses temporal binding.

**Experiential continuity** at longer timescales extends beyond the specious present. The Map's treatment of [temporal integration](/topics/consciousness-and-temporal-integration/) distinguishes micro-integration (within the specious present), meso-integration (across successive specious presents), and macro-integration (the [temporal self](/autonoetic-consciousness/) spanning a lifetime). Temporal unity in its strict sense concerns micro- and meso-integration. Macro-integration involves additional capacities—episodic memory, narrative identity—that go beyond temporal unity proper.

## Why Temporal Unity Is Philosophically Significant

Temporal unity poses a distinctive challenge that spatial binding does not. Spatial binding unites elements that co-exist: the redness and the roundness are present at the same time, available for simultaneous integration. Temporal unity must unite elements that, by definition, do not co-exist. The just-past note has ceased; the anticipated note has not yet begun. Yet the present moment phenomenally contains both—retention holds what just was, protention reaches toward what is coming.

This generates a paradox. Three responses structure the philosophical debate:

**Extensionalism** (Dainton, Foster): Experience is genuinely temporally extended, having temporal parts as spatial objects have spatial parts. Temporal unity is the unity of an extended whole, not a construction from instantaneous elements.

**Retentionalism** (Husserl, Broad): Each moment is technically instantaneous but contains past-directed and future-directed intentional content. Temporal unity arises from how these intentional structures nest within each other—each moment's retention retaining the previous moment's retention, and so on.

**Process metaphysics** (Whitehead): Each moment of experience *prehends* its predecessors, inheriting their actuality through direct causal contact rather than representation. Temporal unity is constituted by this inheritance relation—a form of experiential continuity more intimate than mere information transfer.

The Map's position draws on modified extensionalism: experience is genuinely extended, and the extension involves quantum [collapse events](/concepts/collapse-and-time/) whose accumulated irreversibility constitutes the duration-block—a temporally extended unit of experience whose boundaries are set by collapse rather than by computational convenience.

## What Disrupts Temporal Unity

Temporal unity can degrade or disappear, revealing its contingent dependence on underlying conditions:

**Dreamless sleep** eliminates temporal unity entirely. Hours pass with no experienced succession. Subject unity may persist across the gap (the same person wakes), but temporal unity does not bridge it.

**Temporal disintegration in schizophrenia** disrupts the binding between moments while leaving within-moment experience relatively intact. Patients report moments losing connection to what came before—actions feeling disconnected from consequences, experience fragmenting into isolated episodes (Fuchs, 2007; Vogeley & Kupke, 2007).

**Absorption and flow states** alter temporal unity without destroying it. Moments become intensely vivid yet loosely coupled to neighbours, producing the paradox of "timelessness" within ongoing experience.

These dissociations support the view that temporal unity is a distinct phenomenal property, not automatically entailed by having experience at all. [Illusionists](/concepts/illusionism/) argue that temporal flow is a constructed narrative rather than a genuine phenomenal property—that the brain stitches together discrete processing moments into an illusion of continuity. The Map's response is that the illusion itself would need to be temporally unified to be experienced as flowing, generating the same explanatory demand at a higher level (see [the regress argument](/concepts/illusionism/#regress)).

## Relation to Site Perspective

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: Temporal unity resists physical reduction. Physics describes a sequence of states; temporal unity is the *felt connectedness* across those states. No description of state A followed by state B captures what it is like to experience A flowing into B. This is the [explanatory gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/)—the gulf between physical and phenomenal description—applied to the temporal dimension: not just "why any experience?" but "why experience that *flows*?"

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)**: If the specious present is constituted by accumulated collapse events, temporal unity is the phenomenal manifestation of consciousness's participation in collapse. The retention-protention structure maps onto the difference between collapsed (definite past) and uncollapsed (open future) states. Temporal unity would then be what it is like to be at the boundary where superposition resolves into fact.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)**: Agency requires temporal unity. Deliberation involves retaining options under consideration while protending toward their consequences (see [phenomenology-of-choice](/concepts/phenomenology-of-choice/)). Without temporal unity binding these phases into a single deliberative episode, there could be no choosing—only isolated mental states with no experiential connection between weighing and deciding.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)**: Temporal unity involves retention inheriting from a *definite, singular* past. Many-worlds defenders reply that each branch-observer inherits determinate content from that branch's history—decoherence selects a preferred basis without collapse. The Map's response: if decoherence alone explains felt determinacy, consciousness plays no role in constituting temporal structure. Temporal unity becomes a passive side-effect of branch selection rather than a manifestation of consciousness participating in the world. The Map holds that temporal unity's phenomenal character—its felt irreversibility, its qualitative asymmetry between past and future—requires consciousness at the collapse boundary, not mere decoherent branching.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)**: Reducing temporal unity to information processing seems simpler but fails to explain its phenomenal richness—the qualitative difference between retention and memory, the felt openness of protention, the seamlessness of experiential flow. The simpler account may reflect our ignorance about what temporal unity requires, not its actual simplicity.
