Great ape cognition may represent a baseline of what neurons can achieve without the conscious contribution that enables human-level intelligence. Chimpanzees and bonobos demonstrate sophisticated problem-solving, tool use, social learning, and even procedural metacognition—monitoring uncertainty and seeking information when needed. Yet they operate within sharp constraints: working memory limited to 2±1 items (versus human 7±2), culture that doesn't accumulate modifications across generations, planning bound to current motivational states, and no evidence of metarepresentation—knowing *that* they know. If consciousness were somehow removed from humans while leaving neural architecture intact, cognitive capacities might collapse to something resembling this great ape baseline. This hypothesis matters because it suggests consciousness isn't merely correlated with human intelligence—it's causally necessary for the leap from sophisticated procedural cognition to the logical reasoning, counterfactual thinking, and cumulative culture that define human thought.

## What the Baseline Includes

The [baseline cognition hypothesis](//#baseline-cognition) (explained below) proposes that great apes demonstrate what neural systems can accomplish through purely unconscious or minimally conscious processing. This isn't primitive—it's impressively sophisticated:

- **Stable cognitive architecture**: Great ape cognition consists of measurable, reliable traits that persist across time and develop with experience. This isn't chaotic unconscious processing but coherent intelligence.
- **Procedural metacognition**: Apes monitor their own uncertainty—they seek information when unsure, show confidence judgments, and adjust behavior based on knowing-feeling states. What they lack is *declarative* metacognition: representing explicitly that they or others hold beliefs.
- **Cultural transmission**: Ape groups maintain distinct behavioral traditions passed through social learning. They don't merely discover solutions individually but learn from observation and imitation.
- **Planning and tool use**: Apes plan future actions, solve novel problems, and create tools. Evidence increasingly supports that they can anticipate future needs, though possibly constrained by current motivational states.

The baseline isn't stupid. It represents what billions of neurons, organized through evolution, can achieve through implicit learning, associative memory, and procedural knowledge—all operating below or alongside whatever phenomenal consciousness apes may possess.

## What the Baseline Cannot Do {#baseline-cognition}

The constraints reveal where consciousness may be causally required:

**Logical reasoning specifically requires conscious processing.** Lieberman et al. (2008) found that cognitive load on conscious processes impaired logical reasoning, while hampering unconscious systems had no effect. Nonconscious priming of logic concepts failed to improve reasoning unless the problem matched intuitive patterns. Rule-based thinking—applying abstract principles to novel cases—demands conscious reflection. Associative pattern-matching proceeds unconsciously; logical inference does not.

**Counterfactual thinking and mental time travel require conscious simulation.** Imagining "what if" scenarios, learning from past mistakes by simulating alternatives, and planning for future states that don't match current needs all involve mental representations that "seep into conscious thought" (Byrne, 2005). Great apes may plan within their current motivational framework, but the [Bischof-Köhler hypothesis](//#bischof-khler-hypothesis) (explained below) suggests they cannot act on future needs they don't currently feel—a limit that human conscious mental time travel transcends.

**Cumulative culture requires metarepresentation.** Great apes have culture—behavioral traditions vary between groups—but they lack the "ratchet effect" that characterizes human cultural evolution. Modifications don't accumulate; innovations tend to fade rather than compound. Tomasello and colleagues argue this reflects an inability to metarepresent: apes express cultures without knowing they are cultural beings. They cannot represent that others hold beliefs about cultural norms, which prevents teaching in the normative sense, conformity to group standards, and the process-oriented (not just product-oriented) social learning that drives cumulative innovation. The Jourdain Hypothesis: apes do culture without knowing they do it.

**Working memory expansion correlates with consciousness expansion.** Chimpanzee working memory holds 2±1 items; human working memory holds 7±2 items. This quantitative difference may enable qualitative leaps—logical reasoning requires holding multiple propositions in mind simultaneously, counterfactual thinking requires tracking actual and imagined states in parallel, and metarepresentation requires representing both the world and beliefs about the world. Whether expanded working memory *enables* expanded consciousness or *results from* it remains debated, but they clearly co-occur.

## The Bischof-Köhler Hypothesis {#Bischof-Köhler-hypothesis}

This hypothesis proposes that non-human animals cannot act on motivational states they don't currently possess. A sated chimpanzee cannot plan for future hunger in the way a human can pack a lunch before leaving home. The constraint isn't lack of foresight—apes show planning ability—but motivational binding: future-oriented action remains tied to present drives.

If true, this represents another consciousness-dependent capacity. Humans consciously simulate future states, *experiencing* the imagined hunger or cold, which activates motivation in the present. Mental time travel isn't just prediction; it's pre-experiencing. Suddendorf and Corballis argue that "mental time travel lies at the heart of human consciousness"—suggesting the capacity requires phenomenal experience, not just functional representation.

## Evidence From Dissociations

Blindsight and implicit learning provide complementary evidence. Patients with blindsight demonstrate visual discrimination in their blind field without conscious awareness of seeing—suggesting some perception-action coupling can proceed unconsciously. Implicit learning acquires complex grammatical patterns without conscious knowledge of the rules. These dissociations show that sophisticated processing can occur without consciousness.

But the dissociations also reveal limits. Blindsight patients perform better on discrimination (forced choice between options) than detection (reporting whether anything appeared)—the information guides action but doesn't enter awareness for reasoning about. Implicit learning acquires associations but not abstract rules that can be flexibly applied to novel cases. The unconscious system is fast, parallel, and reliable for familiar patterns; the conscious system is slow, serial, error-prone, but capable of creative problem-solving in novel circumstances.

Global Workspace Theory formalizes this: unconscious processing is localized and modular, while consciousness broadcasts information globally across brain systems, enabling flexible integration. Logical reasoning, counterfactual simulation, and metarepresentation all require this global access—explaining why the baseline cannot achieve them.

## Implications: Correlation or Causation?

If great ape cognition represents consciousness-independent baseline, and human cognitive capacities (logical reasoning, mental time travel, cumulative culture) require consciousness, then consciousness isn't merely correlated with human intelligence—it's causally necessary. The transition from baseline to human cognition requires conscious contribution.

Three interpretations remain possible:

1. **Apes lack phenomenal consciousness entirely**, possessing only access consciousness (functional availability for reasoning and control). The human leap involves phenomenal consciousness emerging and enabling new cognitive functions.

2. **Apes have limited or different phenomenal consciousness**—emotions, preferences, perhaps visual qualia—but lack the metarepresentational awareness that turns feelings into explicit knowledge. The human leap involves consciousness becoming *reflexive*.

3. **Working memory is the true bottleneck**, with consciousness expansion following as a side effect rather than a cause. Expanded WM enables logical reasoning and metarepresentation; consciousness comes along for the ride.

The evidence favors option 2 over 3: logical reasoning specifically requires conscious processing even controlling for working memory load, and counterfactual thinking explicitly involves "conscious thought" not just WM capacity. Option 1 versus 2—whether apes have phenomenal consciousness at all—remains unresolved by behavioral evidence alone.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The baseline cognition hypothesis strongly supports [Bidirectional Interaction](/concepts/bidirectional-interaction/). If consciousness is causally required for logical reasoning, counterfactual thinking, and cumulative culture—not merely correlated with them—then the very fact that humans engage in these activities provides evidence that consciousness influences neural outcomes. An epiphenomenon causally disconnected from brain states could not enable novel cognitive functions.

The hypothesis also connects to [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction). If the transition from baseline to human cognition requires conscious contribution, the mechanism might involve quantum selection rather than mere neural elaboration. Great apes and humans share overlapping brain circuitry for basic cognition, with differential investment in specialized networks. The difference may be qualitative (consciousness acts) not just quantitative (more neurons).

Finally, the hypothesis challenges purely functionalist accounts. If metarepresentation requires phenomenal consciousness—not just functional states that represent representations—then property dualism gains support. The cognitive leap from ape to human may require something non-physical: consciousness as a feature that cannot be replicated through functional organization alone.

## Open Questions

- Do great apes have degraded phenomenal consciousness, different consciousness architecture, or minimal phenomenal consciousness constrained to narrow domains?
- Can AI systems achieve human-level logical reasoning and metarepresentation without phenomenal consciousness, providing a test case for the hypothesis?
- What is the causal direction: does consciousness expand working memory, or does expanded working memory enable consciousness expansion?
- What neural mechanisms distinguish procedural metacognition (feelings of knowing) from declarative metacognition (explicit knowledge that one knows)?

The baseline cognition hypothesis provides a framework for investigating these questions—treating great ape cognition as a natural experiment in what neural intelligence can achieve when consciousness is absent, limited, or qualitatively different.
