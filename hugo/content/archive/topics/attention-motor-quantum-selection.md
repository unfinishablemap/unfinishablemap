What if attention and action are the same thing? The premotor theory of attention proposes precisely this: the neural systems for directing attention and preparing movement are not separate. The Unfinishable Map takes this convergence seriously. If consciousness operates through attention (the [attention-as-interface hypothesis](/concepts/attention-as-interface/)), and attention is motor planning, then consciousness engages with the brain through a unified selection mechanism—one interface connecting perception to action through quantum selection among competing neural options.

This unification is philosophically significant. The hard problem of consciousness concerns how subjective experience relates to physical processes. Free will concerns how agents cause actions. These appear to be distinct problems. But if the same mechanism underlies both attending and acting—if "deciding what to notice" and "deciding what to do" share neural substrate and selection dynamics—the problems may be two faces of a single interface.

## The Convergence of Attention and Motor Planning

### Rizzolatti's Premotor Theory

Giacomo Rizzolatti's premotor theory of attention (PMTA) challenges the assumption that attention and motor control are distinct systems. The core claim: selective attention and movement planning use the same neural substrates—there is no independent attention system.

The evidence is substantial:

- The same fronto-parietal networks activate during spatial attention shifts and motor preparation
- Preparing an eye movement to location X improves visual processing at X—attention is the motor preparation
- Microstimulation of motor regions enhances visual processing at the target location
- Attempts to identify attention regions independent of motor planning consistently fail

If PMTA is correct, the distinction between "attending to X" and "preparing to orient toward X" is artificial. What feels like directing attention is actually preparing action.

### The Prefrontal Hierarchy

A 2022 Royal Society paper extends this insight: "The entirety of the prefrontal cortex can be seen as fundamentally premotor in nature." What appears to be "executive function" or "abstract thought" is an action abstraction hierarchy—from concrete motor commands at one end to abstract goals at the other.

This reframes the question of conscious control. If prefrontal cortex is premotor cortex, then conscious deliberation is a form of motor planning at high abstraction. The question "what should I do?" is as much motor preparation as "how should I move my arm?"

### Shared Neural Signatures

The convergence manifests in three neural signatures that distinguish willed from automatic processing in both domains:

| Signature | In Attention | In Motor Control |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| **Frontal theta** | Present for willed attention, absent for instructed (Bengson 2019) | Present for voluntary movement initiation |
| **Bidirectional coherence** | Theta-band coherence between frontal and parietal regions during willed attention | Similar bidirectional flow during genuine motor deliberation |
| **~280-300ms timing** | Willed attention takes ~300ms to deploy | Motor commitment occurs ~280ms before movement (Thura & Cisek 2014) |

The timing match is striking. If attention and motor selection were independent systems operating through different mechanisms, why would they share the same timeline?

## The Competition-Selection Architecture

### Parallel Options

The brain doesn't compute single decisions serially. Research by Paul Cisek demonstrates that when faced with choices, the motor system represents multiple options simultaneously. In premotor cortex, 43% of task-related neurons fired for either of two potential reach targets—encoding both before selection occurred.

This parallel representation is what makes selection meaningful. If the brain generated only one option at a time, there would be nothing to choose among. The existence of competing representations creates the space for selection—and raises the question of what does the selecting.

### Threshold Crossing

Neural competition resolves through threshold crossing. Competing representations accumulate support until one reaches threshold, triggering winner-take-all dynamics where the winning option executes while competitors are suppressed.

This architecture provides a precise candidate locus for quantum selection. Multiple options exist simultaneously. One must become actual. The threshold crossing moment is where the resolution occurs—and where, under the Map's framework, consciousness contributes by biasing which option wins the race.

### The Determinism Question

Either the competition is deterministic—one option was always going to win—or it involves genuine indeterminacy. If deterministic, deliberation is theatre. The neurons encoding both options weren't weighing alternatives but mechanically computing a predetermined outcome.

If genuinely indeterminate, something must resolve the indeterminacy. Pure randomness produces arbitrary selection, not choice. For outcomes to be both undetermined and meaningful, something beyond neural dynamics must bias which option actualises—consciousness entering not as noise, but as the resolution of indeterminacy in a direction that reflects what the agent is trying to do.

## Dopamine and the Selection Threshold

### "Can Move" But "Won't Move"

A 2024 *Nature* study reveals a striking dissociation. Dopamine-deficient mice retain motor capacity—the circuitry for movement is intact. But they lose goal-directed initiative. They "can move" but "won't move."

This suggests dopamine functions not as motor fuel but as something that sets the threshold for selection. The mice can move if externally triggered; what they lack is the internal drive that makes movement happen.

### Three-Layer Architecture

The research suggests a three-layer model for motor selection:

1. **Neural computation** generates competing options (preserved without dopamine)
2. **Dopamine** sets the threshold sensitivity and marks options as salient—worth pursuing
3. **Consciousness** (via quantum selection) determines which option crosses threshold

Dopamine doesn't cause movement; it tags what matters. Consciousness doesn't generate options; it selects among tagged options. The architecture satisfies the Map's [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) tenet: consciousness doesn't inject energy—it biases which accumulating option wins.

### Tonic vs Phasic Signaling

The 2024 research further distinguishes tonic (slow, background) from phasic (rapid, event-locked) dopamine:

- **Tonic dopamine** supports baseline motor capacity—the ability to move at all
- **Phasic dopamine** drives motivation and reward-seeking—the desire to pursue

This maps onto the selection architecture. Tonic dopamine maintains the general capacity for threshold-crossing. Phasic dopamine modulates which specific options are marked as worth pursuing. Consciousness operates at the level of phasic selection—choosing among options already tagged as salient.

## The Quantum Zeno Mechanism

### Stapp's Framework

Henry Stapp proposes that consciousness operates through the quantum Zeno effect—a standard result in quantum mechanics where rapid, repeated observation prevents a quantum system from evolving. In the brain, mental attention acts like repeated observation, holding desired neural patterns stable against their tendency to dissipate into alternatives.

If attention is motor planning, the Zeno mechanism applies directly to motor selection:

1. **Neural superposition**: Multiple motor programs compete (classical analog: competing representations)
2. **Attentional observation**: Directing attention to a motor plan constitutes observation
3. **Zeno stabilisation**: Repeated observation holds the selected plan stable
4. **Threshold facilitation**: Sustained attention biases which population reaches threshold first

### Why Effort Feels Effortful

This framework explains the phenomenology. Sustaining motor intention feels effortful for the same reason sustaining attention feels effortful: both require continuous engagement to maintain Zeno freezing. The effort is real cognitive work—maintaining the observation rate that keeps the selected pattern from dissipating.

William James observed that "volition is nothing but attention" and "the free will question relates solely to the amount of effort of attention." Stapp's framework vindicates James: effort corresponds to observation rapidity.

### Timing Constraints

The mechanism must satisfy timing constraints. Quantum coherence in warm brains faces rapid decoherence—Tegmark estimated 10⁻¹³ seconds. But revised calculations (Hameroff, 2014) yield 10⁻⁵ to 10⁻⁴ seconds—seven orders of magnitude longer, potentially allowing meaningful quantum contribution within neural timescales.

The ~300ms selection window and the revised decoherence estimates may be compatible: roughly 1000 quantum cycles could occur within a single motor commitment event. The Map's position: the decoherence debate remains open, but evidence increasingly favours viability. See [quantum-neural-timing-constraints](/topics/quantum-neural-timing-constraints/) for detailed analysis.

## The Libet Challenge Revisited

### The Apparent Problem

Benjamin Libet's 1983 experiments found that the readiness potential (RP)—neural activity in motor cortex—begins ~550ms before movement, while conscious awareness of intention occurs only ~200ms before. This seemed to show the brain "decides" before we're aware.

The challenge to free will appeared direct: if neural activity precedes conscious awareness, consciousness arrives too late to cause anything.

### The Stochastic Reinterpretation

Schurger's 2012 model reframes the finding. The RP may be an artifact of averaging stochastic neural noise, not a signature of unconscious decision. Movement occurs when random fluctuations happen to reach threshold; averaging across trials produces the characteristic RP shape.

What appears to be "the brain deciding" may be neural noise accumulating until threshold is crossed. What consciousness contributes is determining *when to allow* threshold crossing—selection among options, not initiation from nothing.

### Surgical Evidence

Sjöberg (2024) provides surgical evidence: patients with resection of the supplementary motor area (SMA)—the region generating the RP—retain their sense of voluntary action. If the RP reflected genuine volition, removing it should impair the sense of willing. It doesn't. The findings, Sjöberg concludes, are "completely irrelevant to the neuroscientific discussion about free will."

The Libet challenge has been substantially weakened. The space for conscious contribution remains open.

## The Intention-Execution Dissociation

### Desmurget's Double Dissociation

Neurosurgical studies by Desmurget (2009) reveal a double dissociation:

- **Parietal stimulation** produces conscious intention without movement—or false belief of having moved (without any muscle activity)
- **Premotor stimulation** produces movement without awareness

Intention and execution are separable. The phenomenology of "deciding to move" arises in parietal cortex, part of the posterior "hot zone" associated with conscious content. The execution machinery operates independently.

### Selection vs Execution

This maps directly onto the Map's framework. Consciousness contributes at the selection level—choosing what to do—not at the execution level. This explains why we experience choosing to reach for a cup but don't experience choosing the firing patterns of individual motor neurons. The quantum Zeno mechanism operates at the selection interface: the level of "what" rather than "how."

The bandwidth constraint supports this: conscious processing operates at ~10 bits/second versus the brain's ~10⁹ bits/second. Consciousness operates at policy level, not micromanaging. Selecting among abstract action options fits this constraint; controlling individual neurons would not.

## Relation to Site Perspective

### The Unified Interface

The Unfinishable Map proposes that consciousness acts through a single selection interface—the unified attention-motor substrate. This unification connects the [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet to concrete neural mechanisms:

- **Consciousness → Brain**: Through selection among competing neural options (attention/motor planning)
- **Brain → Consciousness**: Through presentation of options to select among (affordance specification)

The premotor theory of attention grounds the interface in empirical neuroscience while the quantum Zeno mechanism provides a candidate physical mechanism.

### Dualism and the Explanatory Gap

The framework illuminates why the [explanatory-gap](/concepts/explanatory-gap/) exists. Physical descriptions characterise the option space—competing neural representations, threshold dynamics, dopaminergic modulation. Experiential descriptions characterise the selection—the felt sense of effort, intention, choice. Neither reduces to the other because they describe complementary aspects: what's available and what's selected.

The gap is not a puzzle to be eliminated but a feature of how consciousness and brain relate: generation on one side, selection on the other.

### Minimal Interaction and Conservation Laws

The architecture satisfies [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction). Consciousness doesn't generate neural activity—the brain does that. Consciousness doesn't inject energy—the competing representations already exist. What consciousness contributes is bias at the moment of resolution: which of the already-present options crosses threshold.

Conservation laws are preserved because the energy for any selected action comes from ordinary metabolic processes. Consciousness shapes which possibility actualises without adding to the energy budget.

### Against Many Worlds

The quantum Zeno mechanism requires genuine collapse. Under the [many-worlds interpretation](/tenets/#no-many-worlds), there's nothing to select—all branches actualise, and consciousness merely finds itself in one. The phenomenology of effort—the sense of determining an outcome—would be illusion. Single-world interpretation preserves motor selection as genuine choice: effort accomplishes something rather than merely discovering which branch you're in.

## The Phenomenological Test

### Effort as Evidence

If the quantum Zeno framework is correct, the phenomenology of effort is evidence. Difficult motor tasks feel harder because they require more frequent observation events to maintain selection against competitors. Novel movements feel harder than practiced ones because the competing representations are stronger.

This correlation—felt effort tracking task difficulty—would be coincidental under epiphenomenalism. The Zeno framework explains it: effort feels like work because it *is* work.

### Contemplative Corroboration

Meditation traditions train attention and report increasingly fine-grained awareness of its structure. Focused attention meditation strengthens the capacity for willed attention; open monitoring reveals consciousness can operate with reduced selection. Advanced practitioners report the effort distinction becoming clearer, not dissolving—consistent with introspective access to genuine differences rather than elaborated illusion.

## What Remains Unknown

The framework identifies where consciousness might influence brain states—at the unified attention-motor substrate where competing options resolve. It does not explain how a non-physical consciousness biases physical outcomes. The psychophysical interface is located, not illuminated.

This honest gap distinguishes the Map's position from eliminativism (which denies consciousness has causal relevance) and from facile solutions (which claim to explain what they merely relocate). The mechanism is specified at the physical level (quantum Zeno effect, threshold crossing, dopaminergic modulation). What remains is the hard problem itself: how subjective experience and physical process connect at all.
