Normative force is the binding grip of an "ought" — the felt demand that moves from recognition to requirement. Pain does not merely inform you that tissue is damaged; it *compels* avoidance. A promise does not merely describe a commitment; it *binds* you to fulfilment. The problem of normative force asks: where does this compulsion come from? The Unfinishable Map argues that normative force is rooted in conscious experience — that without phenomenal consciousness, the gap between recognising a fact and being bound by it cannot be closed. This article examines why that gap exists, why standard philosophical accounts struggle to close it, and what consciousness contributes that nothing else can.

## The Gap Between Recognition and Requirement

Consider the difference between two kinds of mental state. You can know that a bridge is structurally unsound — that is a descriptive fact. You can also know that you ought not to walk across it — that carries normative force. The first informs; the second binds. What transforms information into obligation?

This is not Hume's is-ought gap restated, though it is related. Hume's problem concerns logical derivation: you cannot deduce "ought" from "is" without a normative premise. The problem of normative force is phenomenological: even when you *accept* a normative claim, what makes it grip you? Why does "you ought to help" feel different from "the cat is on the mat"?

Philosophers have noted this distinction. Christine Korsgaard, in *The Sources of Normativity* (1996), frames it as the question of what gives moral claims their authority over us — why they are not merely good advice but genuine demands. She argues that the source lies in practical reason's reflective structure: we cannot act without endorsing principles, and this endorsement generates normativity. But this relocates the question without answering it. Why does reflective endorsement *bind*? What gives the output of practical reason its felt compulsive character?

The problem sharpens when we consider creatures without consciousness. A thermostat "recognises" temperature changes and "responds" appropriately, but no one attributes normative force to its operations. It does not experience the temperature as *demanding* adjustment. Something about consciousness transforms mere responsiveness into genuine normative grip.

## Why Standard Accounts Fall Short

### Rationalism

Kantian rationalism locates normative force in reason itself. The categorical imperative binds because any rational agent, through reflection, must acknowledge it. Normative force is the force of rational consistency — violating a moral law is akin to contradicting yourself.

The difficulty: rational consistency is a formal property. You can be formally consistent while endorsing monstrous principles, provided you universalise them. More fundamentally, the feeling of rational compulsion — the sense that you *must* accept the conclusion — is itself a phenomenal state. Absent that felt necessity, the logical relations would be inert. A computer can verify logical consistency without experiencing any normative pull. The force in rational normativity depends on what it feels like to reason, which means rationalism presupposes consciousness rather than explaining normative force independently.

### Contractualism

Social contract theories ground normative force in what rational agents would agree to under idealised conditions. You ought to keep promises because promise-keeping is part of a system everyone would endorse.

But hypothetical agreement lacks phenomenal grip. The fact that idealised agents *would* agree does not explain why *you*, here, now, feel bound. Agreement generates expectations, but expectations are descriptive (people will count on you) not normative (you genuinely ought). The normative force of a promise — the felt weight when you consider breaking one — is an experience that contractualism describes from the outside but cannot generate from within.

### Naturalism

Moral naturalism identifies normative facts with natural facts: "good" means something like "conducive to flourishing" or "fitness-enhancing." If normative properties just are natural properties, normative force would be explained by ordinary causal relations.

This faces Moore's open question. For any natural property N, you can coherently ask: "X has N, but ought I to pursue it?" The question remains open because normative force is phenomenologically distinct from causal regularity. The fact that something promotes flourishing is a description; that it *demands* pursuit is normative. Naturalism collapses the distinction that needs explaining.

### Expressivism

Expressivists deny that normative claims state facts at all — "torture is wrong" expresses disapproval rather than describing a property. Normative force, on this view, is the motivational force of attitudes.

This captures something important: normative force does involve motivation. But it abandons the idea that normative claims are *about* anything — that torture really is wrong, not just disapproved of. The phenomenology of moral experience resists this deflation. Encountering cruelty does not feel like projecting an attitude onto a neutral event. It feels like perceiving something genuinely wrong. The normative force comes from the encounter, not from the attitude one brings to it.

## What Consciousness Contributes

Each account fails at the same point: explaining why normative claims grip us rather than merely informing us. Consciousness provides what is missing — not as a theory but as the medium in which normative force exists.

### Felt Valence as Intrinsic Normativity

[Phenomenal normativity](/concepts/phenomenal-normativity/) holds that certain experiences carry normative force in their very phenomenal character. Pain's badness is not a judgment added to a neutral sensation — the badness is constitutive of what pain feels like. When you experience pain, you are directly acquainted with something that demands response. This is not inference from sensation to evaluation; it is a single experience with both descriptive and normative character simultaneously.

This matters because it locates normative force *within* experience rather than in external relations between experience and something else (reason, agreement, natural facts). The problem of normative force dissolves for hedonic cases: pain binds because binding is what pain does. The normative force is the experience, not a consequence of it.

### The Motivational Unity of Experience

Conscious experience does not separate perceiving, evaluating, and motivating into discrete steps. When you see a child in danger, the perception of danger, the recognition that help is needed, and the motivational pull toward action arrive as a unified phenomenal state. This unity is what normative force feels like from the inside.

Compare this with a surveillance system that detects a child in danger. It can "perceive" the situation, "evaluate" it against criteria, and "trigger" a response — but these are computationally separable stages with no unified phenomenal state binding them. The system lacks what experience provides: the seamless integration of fact and demand that constitutes normative grip.

### From Hedonic to Broader Normativity

Pain and pleasure provide clear cases of felt normativity, but normative force extends beyond hedonic experience. The felt weight of a broken promise, the phenomenal pull of an unfinished argument, the experiential demand of beauty — these carry normative force that is not straightforwardly hedonic.

The Map's [phenomenal value pluralism](/concepts/phenomenal-value-realism/#beyond-hedonism) addresses this. Multiple features of experience — meaning, agency, understanding, connection, aesthetic quality — carry intrinsic normative force. The felt significance of meaningful work is not reducible to its pleasantness. The phenomenal character of genuine understanding includes a normative dimension: truth *matters*, and you experience it mattering.

This pluralism faces a challenge: if normative force is built into many kinds of experience, what unifies them? The answer may be that consciousness itself — the condition of there being something it is like — is what makes any experience capable of carrying normative weight. Normative force is a property of experience as such, diversified across hedonic, epistemic, aesthetic, and moral domains but unified by requiring a conscious subject.

## The Epiphenomenalist Threat

If normative force lives in consciousness, consciousness must be able to *do something* about it. Pain's demand for avoidance is empty if conscious experience cannot influence behaviour. This is why [epiphenomenalism](/arguments/epiphenomenalism/) — the view that consciousness is causally inert — threatens normative force directly.

An epiphenomenal consciousness could experience pain's badness but could not act on it. The felt demand would be entirely disconnected from behaviour. You would avoid pain, but not because it felt bad — your physical brain states would handle avoidance independently, with the phenomenal demand as an idle accompaniment.

This makes normative force practically vacuous. If pain's "ought to be avoided" makes no causal difference to whether you avoid it, the normative force is functionally meaningless. The Map's [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet resists this outcome: consciousness causally influences the physical world, which means normative force — experienced as binding demand — can genuinely move agents to act. The felt authority of an "ought" makes a difference because consciousness makes a difference.

## Normative Force and the Explanatory Gap

The [hard problem of consciousness](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/) asks why physical processes give rise to subjective experience at all. The problem of normative force adds a further dimension: why does experience carry binding demands?

These problems may be connected. If phenomenal character is not explained by physical structure, and normative force is constitutive of phenomenal character, then normative force inherits the explanatory gap. No physical description of neural firing patterns explains why those patterns feel like something, and no description of what they feel like explains — in reductive terms — why that feeling binds.

This suggests normative force is as fundamental as consciousness itself. It is not a derived property that emerges when consciousness reaches sufficient complexity. It is present wherever consciousness has valenced character — which may be wherever consciousness exists at all, given that experience without any felt quality is difficult to conceive.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The problem of normative force connects to the Map's tenets in ways that sharpen both the problem and the Map's response.

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)** is central. If consciousness is irreducible, normative force — as a feature of consciousness — is equally irreducible. Materialist accounts must either reduce normative force to physical properties (losing its binding character) or treat it as an illusion (losing its reality). Dualism preserves normative force as genuinely real and genuinely binding, grounded in a domain that physical description does not exhaust.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)** ensures normative force is not practically empty. The felt demand of an "ought" can influence action because consciousness can influence physical outcomes. Without this tenet, normative force would be real but impotent — experienced as binding but unable to bind. Mental causation transforms felt normativity from phenomenal decoration into practical authority.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)** applies to reductive accounts of normativity. Explaining away normative force as evolutionary heuristic or social construction is simpler than positing it as an irreducible feature of consciousness. But the simpler explanation fails to capture what it purports to explain. The felt grip of a moral demand is not an illusion generated by evolutionary pressures; it is an encounter with something that matters. Parsimony here purchases explanatory adequacy at the cost of ignoring the primary datum.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)** preserves the stakes that normative force requires. If every possible action is realised across quantum branches, the demand to choose rightly loses its grip — all choices are made, all consequences realised. Normative force presupposes that what happens *here*, in *this* branch, is what matters. The rejection of many-worlds preserves the determinacy that makes "you ought" meaningful.

## What Would Challenge This View?

The consciousness-based account of normative force would face pressure if:

1. **Normative force persisted without consciousness.** If a system demonstrably lacking phenomenal experience exhibited genuine normative responsiveness — not merely functional approximation — this would undermine the claim that consciousness is necessary.

2. **Conscious beings experienced normativity as entirely projected.** If rigorous phenomenological investigation revealed that the binding character of normative claims was always attribution rather than encounter — that the force was added by the subject rather than found in experience — the constitutive claim would fail.

3. **Rationalism succeeded on its own terms.** If a purely formal account of normative force explained its binding character without appealing to phenomenal experience — if logical consistency alone could generate felt compulsion — the consciousness requirement would be unnecessary.

4. **Evolutionary debunking proved complete.** If normative phenomenology were fully explicable as an adaptive illusion — and if this explanation did not itself rely on normative force — then the appearance of binding force would be explained without positing its reality.
