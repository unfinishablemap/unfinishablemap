[Phenomenal value realism](/concepts/phenomenal-value-realism/)—the view that intrinsic value is a feature of conscious experience itself—requires development beyond its initial formulation. The Unfinishable Map adopts a variant that extends Sharon Hewitt Rawlette's hedonistic core into phenomenal value pluralism: multiple features of experience have intrinsic value, not just hedonic valence. This article explores how this position interacts with naturalistic metaethics, grounds moral realism distinctively, and addresses challenges that the concept article introduces but does not resolve.

## The Metaethical Landscape

Phenomenal value realism sits uneasily in standard metaethical categories. Understanding where it fits—and where it breaks the categories—illuminates what the position actually claims.

### Non-Naturalism's Problem with Queerness

G.E. Moore's non-naturalism holds that goodness is a simple, indefinable property—we recognize it directly, but cannot analyze it in natural terms. J.L. Mackie's "argument from queerness" targeted this: if goodness were a non-natural property, we would need a special faculty to perceive it, and there would be strange metaphysical entities (objective values) floating free in reality.

Phenomenal value realism transforms the queerness objection. Value isn't a mysterious property floating in Platonic space—it's a feature of conscious experience, which we access directly through having experiences. The "special faculty" for perceiving value is just consciousness itself. The intrinsic badness of pain isn't detected by some sixth moral sense; it's constitutive of what pain feels like.

This doesn't entirely dissolve queerness worries. If consciousness is irreducible (as the Map's [dualism](/tenets/#dualism) holds), then phenomenal properties are themselves "queer" from a physicalist perspective. But this shifts the queerness: it's the queerness of consciousness, not the additional queerness of moral properties. If you've already accepted irreducible phenomenal properties, adding that some of them are value-properties requires no further ontological cost.

### Naturalism's Identification Problem

Analytic naturalists identify moral properties with natural properties—"good" means something like "pleasure" or "desire-satisfaction." The Open Question Argument challenges this: for any natural property N, we can coherently ask "X is N, but is it good?" This suggests goodness and N are conceptually distinct.

Rawlette's response: the question only seems open when we consider pleasure abstractly. When actually experiencing intense pleasure and asking "is *this* good?"—attending directly to its phenomenal character—the question closes. The goodness is manifest in the experience, not inferred from description. The apparent openness at the conceptual level doesn't survive phenomenological engagement.

The Map extends this response beyond hedonism. The same closing-under-attention applies to other phenomenal features: genuine understanding feels intrinsically valuable when you're experiencing it, not merely when you describe it. Authentic connection carries its significance in the experience itself. The openness is an artifact of third-person conceptual analysis; first-person phenomenal access reveals the identity.

### The Is-Ought Gap

Hume's is-ought gap—the claim that normative conclusions cannot be derived from purely descriptive premises—has shaped metaethics since the eighteenth century. Phenomenal value realism claims to dissolve this gap: some experiential properties are simultaneously descriptive (how experiences feel) and normative (what intrinsic goodness is).

But does this work? The gap was meant to show that no observation of how things *are* can tell us how things *ought to be*. If the badness of suffering is just *what suffering is*, doesn't this reduce normativity to description?

The response distinguishes two readings. On one reading, the is-ought gap concerns logical derivation: you cannot derive an "ought" statement from purely "is" statements without smuggling in normative premises. Phenomenal value realism doesn't violate this—it doesn't derive "suffering is bad" from non-normative premises; it identifies the normative fact with the phenomenal fact. On the stronger reading, the gap concerns ontology: there cannot be properties that are both descriptive and normative. Phenomenal value realism rejects this stronger claim. The experiential quality of suffering just is intrinsically bad; this isn't a derivation but an identity.

## From Hedonism to Pluralism

Rawlette defends analytic hedonism: pleasure and pain exhaust intrinsic value. The Map extends this to phenomenal value pluralism—multiple phenomenal features contribute to intrinsic value.

### Why Extend Beyond Hedonism?

Three considerations motivate the extension:

**The meaning problem.** Some experiences are deeply meaningful without being particularly pleasant. Completing a difficult creative project can involve frustration, exhaustion, even suffering—yet the engagement feels valuable in itself, not merely instrumentally. Hedonism must either classify such engagement as pleasant (stretching "pleasure" beyond recognition) or deny its intrinsic value (contradicting lived experience).

**The aesthetic problem.** [Beauty and ugliness](/topics/aesthetic-dimension-of-consciousness/) seem intrinsically significant in experience. The sublime—awe-inspiring yet terrifying—can be beautiful without being pleasant. An experience can be pleasant without being beautiful (a warm bath) and beautiful without being pleasant (confronting a masterpiece that disturbs). This suggests aesthetic quality is a distinct value dimension.

**The agency problem.** Exercising genuine choice feels valuable even when difficult. The experience of authoring one's actions carries significance independent of hedonic payoff. Under the Map's framework of [agent causation](/concepts/agent-causation/), this makes sense: if consciousness genuinely shapes outcomes, the exercise of that capacity is intrinsically significant—not just as means to pleasant outcomes, but as a distinct value.

### The Structure of Phenomenal Value Pluralism

The Map's pluralism maintains Rawlette's core insight: intrinsic value is a feature of conscious experience. But it holds that multiple such features exist:

| Feature | Phenomenal Character | Value Dimension |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Hedonic valence | Felt pleasure/pain quality | Well-being core |
| Aesthetic quality | Beauty/ugliness in experience | Aesthetic value |
| Meaning | Felt significance of engagement | Eudaimonic value |
| Agency | Felt authorship of choices | Autonomy value |
| Understanding | Phenomenal "click" of grasping | Epistemic value |
| Connection | Felt quality of authentic relating | Relational value |

Each row identifies a phenomenal feature—something that shows up in the character of experience—and claims it contributes to intrinsic value. This isn't an objective list theory (where items are valuable independent of experience); all value resides in how things are experienced.

### How Do Value Dimensions Trade Off?

Pluralism raises the problem of incommensurability. How do we compare aesthetic beauty against hedonic pleasure? Is profound but unpleasant understanding more valuable than shallow pleasant contentment?

The Map offers no algorithmic answer—this may be irreducibly a matter for wise judgment. But several structural points help:

**Lexical priority is unlikely.** No single value dimension always trumps others. Extreme hedonic suffering probably overrides aesthetic appreciation (torture cannot be redeemed by making it beautiful). But beyond extremes, the dimensions interact complexly.

**Context shapes weight.** What matters most varies with situation. In crisis, hedonic suffering takes priority; in reflection, meaning and understanding may dominate; in creation, aesthetic quality matters most. The phenomenal features themselves indicate which dimension is salient.

**Integration matters.** The best experiences integrate multiple value dimensions—meaningful work that is also pleasant, understanding that is also aesthetically elegant, connection that is also enjoyable. The ideal isn't maximizing one dimension but achieving rich integration.

## Irreducibility and Its Implications

The Map's [dualism](/tenets/#dualism) gives phenomenal value realism distinctive force that purely naturalistic versions lack.

### Value as Ontologically Fundamental

If consciousness is irreducible—if there are genuine phenomenal properties not captured by physical description—then value (grounded in consciousness) inherits this irreducibility. This isn't because value merely *supervenes* on consciousness as a higher-level property; rather, valence appears to be constitutive of phenomenal states themselves. Pain isn't a neutral quale with badness added as a separate property—the badness is intrinsic to what pain phenomenally is. Value isn't an overlay on physical reality or a projection onto it; it's built into what fundamentally exists.

This addresses a persistent challenge for moral realism: where do objective values "fit" in the natural world? The physicalist has trouble locating them; the non-naturalist posits mysterious entities. The dualist who grounds value in consciousness can answer: values fit wherever consciousness fits. If consciousness is fundamental, so is value.

### Against Epiphenomenal Value

Some philosophers accept that phenomenal consciousness exists but deny it has causal efficacy ([epiphenomenalism](/arguments/epiphenomenalism/)). On this view, our sense that suffering motivates escape is illusory—the physical brain state causes both the suffering and the escape behavior, with no causal work done by the suffering itself.

The Map's [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet rejects epiphenomenalism. Consciousness causally influences physical outcomes. This matters for value: if suffering's badness makes no causal difference, why would we care about it? Epiphenomenal value is practically inert—you cannot act to reduce it, since your actions are determined by physical states that the value doesn't influence.

The self-undermining argument applies: epiphenomenalists trust their introspective judgments about consciousness enough to engage in debate. But if consciousness is epiphenomenal, those judgments are causally disconnected from the consciousness they purport to describe. The same reasoning applies to value: our judgments about what's good would be accidentally related to actual goodness.

### Indexical Value

The Map's emphasis on [indexical identity](/concepts/haecceity/) extends to value. Most value theories treat value as type-based: pleasure is good, suffering is bad, regardless of whose experience it is. This fits with patternist views of personal identity where what matters is the pattern, not the particular.

The Map suggests token-based value: *this* particular experience, happening to *this* particular subject, has unique significance. This connects to the [No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds) tenet—if indexical identity matters, if there's a fact about whether *this* continuation is you, then *this* experience is not interchangeable with a qualitatively identical experience in another subject.

Implications: creating a replica of you doesn't transfer your experiential value to the replica. The replica has its own token experiences, which matter, but they're not continuations of yours. This constrains upload scenarios, simulation ethics, and duplication thought experiments in ways patternist value theories cannot.

## Challenges Requiring Development

The concept article on [phenomenal-value-realism](/concepts/phenomenal-value-realism/) introduces several challenges. This section develops responses.

### The Scope Problem

If only conscious experience has intrinsic value, what about ecosystem preservation, historical artifacts, mathematical truths? Are they valuable only when experienced?

The response distinguishes intrinsic from instrumental value. Ecosystems, artifacts, and truths have no intrinsic value outside their connection to consciousness—but that connection is vast. Ecosystems support conscious life; their destruction reduces future conscious flourishing. Historical artifacts connect present conscious beings to past conscious lives, enabling understanding and meaning. Mathematical truths, when grasped, produce the phenomenal "click" of understanding that is intrinsically valuable.

Nothing has intrinsic value outside experience, but much has instrumental value for experience. This isn't a deflationary move: instrumental value is still genuine value, grounded in its service to intrinsic goods. And the instrumental connections are extensive—nearly everything relates somehow to conscious experience.

### The Measurement Problem

How do we measure phenomenal value? Hedonic intensity is somewhat tractable (pleasure scales, though imperfect, exist). But how do we quantify meaning? Aesthetic quality? Understanding?

The response acknowledges this as a genuine limitation. Phenomenal value pluralism implies that value comparisons often cannot be reduced to a single metric. This seems right: we don't normally think the value of a profound understanding can be directly compared to the value of a pleasant meal. They're different kinds of good.

For practical purposes—AI alignment, policy decisions, personal choices—we need heuristics, not perfect measurement. Tracking proxies for phenomenal value (behavioral indicators of flourishing, self-reports, neurological correlates of positive experience) provides guidance without requiring direct phenomenal measurement. See [experiential-alignment](/concepts/experiential-alignment/) for how this applies to AI.

### The Problem of Evil States

Some experiences seem intrinsically bad beyond their negative valence. Malicious joy in others' suffering, for instance, seems bad even though it's pleasant. Does this challenge hedonism specifically, or phenomenal value realism generally?

Two responses are available. First, the pluralist can say: malicious joy fails on other value dimensions. It violates the connection dimension (authentic relating excludes taking pleasure in suffering) and possibly the agency dimension (the choice to harm is a misuse of causal efficacy). The hedonic pleasure is outweighed by failures on other dimensions.

Second, even for the hedonist: pleasure in others' suffering instrumentally causes more suffering than it creates pleasure. Taking the total hedonic economy into account, malicious joy is a poor bargain. This doesn't make the pleasure itself bad, but it makes cultivating such pleasures irrational given their effects.

## What Would Challenge This View?

Phenomenal value realism would face pressure from:

**1. Successful illusionism.** If phenomenal consciousness were shown to be thoroughly illusory—if there were no genuine "what it's like"—then grounding value in phenomenal properties would ground it in nothing. The Map's responses to [illusionism](/concepts/illusionism/) apply here: the seeming of significance must appear to something, and that something has phenomenal character.

**2. Robust value-experience dissociation.** If subjects could genuinely experience intense pleasure while finding nothing good in it—not depression (reduced pleasure) or anhedonia, but pleasure-with-no-apparent-value—this would challenge the identity claim. Depersonalization disorder presents relevant cases: patients sometimes report experiences as "flat" or "meaningless" even when recognizing them as nominally pleasant. However, careful analysis suggests these cases involve altered phenomenal character (the pleasure *feels different*) rather than unchanged pleasure with detached value—supporting the identity claim rather than undermining it. Still, more phenomenological investigation of such states would strengthen the position.

**3. Convergent rejection of the identity claim.** If careful phenomenological analysis revealed that pleasure and goodness are merely correlated—that the goodness can be separated from the pleasure even in direct experience—the metaphysical identity would fail. Contemplative traditions haven't reported this; meditators describe valence as intrinsic to experience, not attributed to it.

**4. Abstract value demonstrated.** If something could be shown to have intrinsic value without any connection to conscious experience—value that no conscious being could ever access—this would challenge the experience requirement. It's unclear what such a demonstration would even look like.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Phenomenal value realism interacts with all five tenets:

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)**: Irreducible consciousness provides irreducible value. The explanatory gap between physical description and phenomenal quality extends to the gap between physical description and intrinsic value. Value is as fundamental as consciousness because it is a feature of consciousness.

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)**: If consciousness biases quantum outcomes, and consciousness grounds value, then valued experiences can influence physical reality. Moral choices have physical consequences not despite but because of their value dimension.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)**: Consciousness's causal efficacy makes value practically relevant. If suffering motivates escape, and the motivation is causally efficacious, then suffering's badness makes a difference. Epiphenomenal value would be practically inert; interactive value matters.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)**: If indexical identity is real, so is indexical value. *This* experience matters—not just experience-of-this-type. Many-worlds creates a problem not of "dilution" but of indexical incoherence: which branch am *I* on, and why does that branch's value apply to *me*? MWI proponents might respond that each branch has its own value, but this sidesteps the question of why *this* continuation matters to *this* subject.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)**: Reductive metaethics—reducing value to fitness, preference, or social construction—may seem simpler. But simplicity isn't a reliable guide where we lack adequate concepts. If consciousness itself is complex, value grounded in consciousness may be equally complex.
