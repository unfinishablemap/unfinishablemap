The Unfinishable Map's [original treatment](/topics/the-interface-location-problem/) of the interface location problem surveyed four candidate sites — microtubules, ion channels, cortical microcolumns, and attention networks — and argued for principled agnosticism. That agnosticism was appropriate at the time: the candidates appeared roughly co-viable and the Map lacked the internal framework to discriminate among them. Since then, several lines of development have changed the situation. The Map now has a [coupling mode taxonomy](/concepts/coupling-modes/), a detailed [attention-motor convergence](/topics/attention-as-selection-interface/) account, a [developmental trajectory](/topics/developmental-trajectory-of-the-interface/), dopamine research clarifying the selection-threshold architecture, and a sharper understanding of what the [specification problem](/topics/the-interface-specification-problem/) demands. These developments do not resolve the location problem. They do constrain it — replacing open agnosticism with what might be called *constrained pluralism*, where the viable candidates and their relationships become clearer.

## What Has Changed

Three developments since the original article shift the landscape.

### The Attention-Motor Convergence

The premotor theory of attention (Rizzolatti) proposes that attention and motor preparation share neural substrates — spatial attention *is* motor planning. The Map's [attention-as-selection-interface](/topics/attention-as-selection-interface/) article integrates this with quantum selection: if attention is motor planning, and consciousness acts through attention, then the interface location must be within the overlapping attention-motor architecture. This eliminates candidates outside that architecture's scope.

The 2025 COGITATE adversarial collaboration reinforced this constraint by distinguishing attention networks (frontoparietal) from consciousness networks (posterior "hot zone"). If consciousness *resides* in posterior cortex but *acts* through frontoparietal attention-motor systems, the interface location is where these systems meet — not in either system alone.

### Dopamine and the Threshold Architecture

A 2024 *Nature* study demonstrated that tonic dopamine supports movement capacity while phasic dopamine drives motivated action — mice with disrupted phasic dopamine "can move" but "won't move." Separate research (Westbrook et al. 2023) showed that striatal dopamine regulates the decision threshold at which competing motor programmes resolve.

This clarifies the relationship between the Map's framework and the physical substrate. Dopamine does not generate movement or select actions — it sets the conditions under which selection occurs. The neural competition model (Cisek 2007) shows that multiple action representations exist simultaneously in premotor cortex, competing until one crosses a threshold. Dopamine modulates that threshold; consciousness, on the Map's account, determines which option crosses first. The interface location, then, must be wherever threshold-crossing events involve quantum indeterminacy.

### The Developmental Trajectory

The Map's [lifespan analysis](/topics/developmental-trajectory-of-the-interface/) revealed that the interface undergoes systematic restructuring — wide aperture in infancy, narrowing through critical periods, peaking in structured control during adulthood, loosening again in age. Any candidate site must account for this trajectory. Static molecular sites (microtubules, individual ion channels) do not obviously explain why the interface character changes with developmental phase. Sites embedded in the attention-motor architecture — which itself undergoes dramatic developmental restructuring — do.

## Constraining the Candidates

These developments do not eliminate candidates so much as reorder them. The original article treated all four candidates as roughly co-viable. The constraints now suggest a hierarchy.

### Attention-Motor Architecture: Promoted

The functional-level account — that the interface operates through whatever systems implement willed attention and motor selection — gains the most from recent developments. The attention-motor convergence gives it anatomical specificity it previously lacked. The dopamine research provides a mechanism for how competition and threshold-crossing work. The developmental trajectory matches the maturation of frontoparietal networks.

The original article's objection — that a functional account must eventually be grounded in physics — remains valid. But the objection now points toward a specific research programme rather than a general inadequacy. The question becomes: within the attention-motor architecture, at what physical level do quantum indeterminacies actually matter?

### Ion Channels: Constrained but Viable

Stapp's ion channel proposal gains from being the most physically specific account of how quantum effects might operate within the attention-motor architecture. Ion channels at synaptic junctions in frontoparietal-premotor circuits are precisely where the threshold-crossing events occur. The proposal's strength was always physical concreteness; what changes is that this concreteness now sits within a clearer functional context.

The timescale objection (the Zeno mechanism requires femtosecond-scale observation while attention operates at ~100ms) remains serious. Stapp's response — that the two-level model used in Monte Carlo critiques (Litt et al. 2006) is too simple for the actual brain — is possible but has not been supported by more detailed modelling.

### Cortical Microcolumns: Constrained but Viable

The microcolumn proposal matches the ~10 bits/second bandwidth constraint and connects to established neuroscience on cortical organisation. Its compatibility with the attention-motor framework is straightforward: microcolumns within frontoparietal and premotor regions could serve as the functional units among which consciousness selects.

The proposal's weakness — limited empirical grounding for the quantum coherence mechanism (zero-point field coupling) — has not been addressed by subsequent research. It remains the least developed of the viable candidates.

### Microtubules: Demoted

Orch OR is not excluded, but it fits least naturally with the developments above. The theory locates quantum effects inside individual neurons rather than at the architectural level where attention-motor competition and threshold-crossing occur. The epothilone B pharmacological evidence remains suggestive but interpretable through non-quantum mechanisms. And Orch OR's reliance on gravitational self-collapse introduces physics that most physicists have not accepted.

More significantly, the developmental trajectory creates a problem for microtubule-based accounts. Microtubules exist in all neurons throughout development; they do not obviously explain why the interface changes character with the maturation of attention networks. The attention-motor framework provides a natural account of developmental change; microtubules do not.

This is not a decisive objection. Microtubules might serve as the molecular substrate *within* the attention-motor architecture — the physical level at which quantum effects actually operate, even as the functional architecture selects which microtubule ensembles become relevant. But this makes microtubules a supporting mechanism within the attention-motor account rather than an independent candidate.

## From Agnosticism to Constrained Pluralism

The original article's agnosticism rested on three grounds: inconclusive evidence, location-independence of the core philosophical claims, and the possibility that multiple sites operate simultaneously.

The first ground has shifted. Evidence remains inconclusive in the sense that no candidate is confirmed, but the field is no longer level. The attention-motor architecture has gained specificity and explanatory reach; microtubules have lost relative standing.

The second ground remains valid. The Map's tenets do not depend on which physical site hosts the interface.

The third ground — multiple simultaneous sites — has become the leading hypothesis rather than merely a possibility. The [hierarchical model](/topics/the-interface-location-problem/#the-hierarchical-possibility) from the original article proposed that the interface spans multiple levels: molecular sites providing the quantum openings, cellular-level aggregation, network-level selection through attention. What constrained pluralism adds is direction: the hierarchy should be understood as attention-motor architecture all the way down, with the molecular level (ion channels, possibly microtubules) providing the physical substrate for quantum effects that the functional level (frontoparietal-premotor competition and threshold-crossing) organises.

The picture is of nested selection: consciousness acts through the attention-motor system, which selects among competing neural patterns, which resolve through threshold-crossing events, which involve quantum indeterminacies at molecular sites. Each level is real and does genuine work. The interface location problem asks "at which level does consciousness act?" and the emerging answer is "at the functional level, through the molecular level."

## What Constrained Pluralism Predicts

Moving from agnosticism to constrained pluralism generates specific expectations that agnosticism could not.

**Developmental correlation.** Interface effectiveness should track the maturation of frontoparietal attention-motor systems, not microtubule abundance or ion channel density per se. The predicted developmental peak is in early adulthood, when executive function peaks, not in infancy (when synaptic density peaks) or childhood (when microtubule density is high).

**Disruption specificity.** Agents disrupting the attention-motor architecture (lesions to frontoparietal cortex, TMS to premotor regions) should disrupt conscious selection more specifically than agents disrupting general neural function. Conversely, enhancing dopaminergic threshold modulation should enhance the conditions for selection without changing its content.

**Theta-beta oscillatory signatures.** If the interface operates through attention-motor threshold-crossing, the transition from beta oscillations (13-30 Hz, associated with movement suppression and "status quo") to theta oscillations (4-10 Hz, associated with prokinetic states and willed attention) should correlate with moments of conscious selection. Dopamine facilitates this shift; conscious effort may be the phenomenal correlate of it.

**Scale-appropriate bandwidth.** The ~10 bits/second constraint on conscious processing should match the scale of attention-motor competition — the number of discriminable action alternatives consciousness can select among per unit time — rather than the number of molecular events per second at any individual site.

## What Remains Open

Constrained pluralism narrows the problem without solving it. Three questions remain.

**The molecular ground.** Within the attention-motor architecture, which molecular mechanism hosts the relevant quantum indeterminacies? Ion channels at synaptic junctions remain the most physically specific candidate. But whether the Zeno mechanism actually works at biologically relevant timescales — or whether some other quantum effect operates instead — is an empirical question that constrained pluralism cannot answer from the armchair.

**The coupling law.** Even knowing the location, the [psychophysical control law](/topics/the-psychophysical-control-law/) remains unspecified. How does phenomenal effort map quantitatively to physical selection bias? The location problem and the specification problem are logically independent: solving one does not solve the other.

**Whether the hierarchy is continuous.** The hierarchical model assumes that molecular-level quantum effects aggregate smoothly into network-level selection. This assumption could be wrong. There might be a sharp transition — a particular level at which consciousness acts, with other levels merely implementing the result. Constrained pluralism is compatible with either picture but cannot adjudicate between them.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The interface location problem sits at the intersection of the Map's philosophical commitments and empirical science. The shift from agnosticism to constrained pluralism reflects the Map's broader development: the framework has become specific enough to constrain empirical questions it originally left open.

The [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) tenet requires that consciousness acts at quantum indeterminacies. Constrained pluralism specifies: at quantum indeterminacies *within the attention-motor architecture*, at sites involved in *threshold-crossing events* during action selection. This is more specific than the original article could manage.

The [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet gains from the dopamine research. The "can move / won't move" dissociation in dopamine-deficient mice — motor capacity intact, goal-directed initiative absent — maps onto the Map's distinction between neural computation (which generates options) and conscious selection (which determines which option becomes action). Dopamine sets the conditions; consciousness does the selecting.

The [Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits) tenet applies to the hierarchical model itself. A single-site answer would be simpler. But if the interface actually spans multiple levels — molecular, cellular, network — insisting on a single site would sacrifice accuracy for parsimony. The Map should follow the evidence toward complexity if that is where the evidence leads.
