title: 'Baseline Cognition: What Neurons Can Do Without Consciousness'
topics: []
---

If consciousness were removed from human cognition—or had never emerged—what would remain? Great ape intelligence may answer this question. Chimpanzees and bonobos show sophisticated problem-solving, tool use, social cognition, and even [metacognitive](/concepts/metacognition/) monitoring of their own uncertainty. Yet they cannot engage in cumulative culture, logical reasoning, or explicit counterfactual thinking. The pattern suggests a hypothesis: great ape cognition represents a "baseline" of what neurons can achieve without conscious elaboration, while human intelligence requires consciousness as a causally necessary amplifier.

This hypothesis has direct implications for the [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet. If the leap from baseline to human cognition requires conscious contribution—not merely correlates with it—then consciousness is causally efficacious, not [epiphenomenal](/arguments/epiphenomenalism/).

## The Great Ape Cognitive Profile

Great apes demonstrate remarkable cognitive abilities that once seemed uniquely human. They recognize themselves in mirrors, understand others' goals and knowledge states, use tools flexibly, and show procedural metacognition by seeking information when uncertain. A 2023 study in *Nature* confirmed that these abilities are stable cognitive traits measurable across individuals and time, not task-specific accidents.

Yet clear limits emerge. The most striking is [working-memory](/concepts/working-memory/) capacity: chimpanzees maintain 2±1 items versus humans' 7±2 items (Miller's famous number). This quantitative gap enables qualitative differences. Complex logical reasoning, holding multiple premises in mind while deriving conclusions, exceeds the 2±1 limit. Similarly, counterfactual simulation—imagining "what if I had done X instead of Y"—requires maintaining both actual and imagined scenarios simultaneously.

The cultural dimension is equally revealing. Great apes have behavioral traditions that vary by group—what anthropologists recognize as culture. Yet these traditions stay within what researchers call the "zone of latent solutions": behaviors the species can already perform. Human culture exhibits a "ratchet effect": modifications accumulate across generations with little backward slippage. Ape culture lacks this cumulative quality. The difference, as Tomasello and others argue, involves [metarepresentation](//#metarepresentation) (explained below): humans can represent that they and others hold beliefs about cultural practices, enabling deliberate modification and teaching of group norms.

## The Metarepresentation Threshold {#metarepresentation}

A 2015 paper by Whiten introduced what he called the "Jourdain hypothesis" (after Molière's character who spoke prose without knowing what prose was): apes express cultures without knowing they are cultural beings. They lack metarepresentations—the ability to represent that they or others hold beliefs about beliefs.

This absence has cascading effects. Teaching in the full human sense requires understanding what the learner doesn't know. Conformity to group norms requires recognizing norms as norms, not just as "what everyone does." Innovation in cumulative culture requires seeing current practices as contingent options that could be improved. All of these require stepping back from immediate procedural knowledge to reflect on knowledge itself.

Metarepresentation may be the cognitive function that [requires consciousness](//#consciousness-requirement) (addressed in the next section). Great apes show procedural metacognition—feelings of knowing, uncertainty monitoring—but not declarative metacognition: explicit representation of what they know. This distinction maps onto the [access versus phenomenal consciousness](/concepts/access-consciousness/) divide. Procedural feelings might not require phenomenal consciousness; explicit representation might.

## Evidence That Consciousness Amplifies Cognition {#consciousness-requirement}

If consciousness were merely correlated with human intelligence—a byproduct with no causal role—then evidence should show cognition proceeding without it. The evidence shows the opposite: key human cognitive functions specifically require conscious processing.

**Logical reasoning depends on consciousness.** A 2008 study by Lieberman and colleagues found that cognitive load on conscious processing impaired logical reasoning, while hampering nonconscious systems had no effect. Rule-based thinking requires conscious reflection; automatic associative thinking does not. This explains why apes can learn complex contingencies but cannot derive syllogistic conclusions.

**Counterfactual thinking requires conscious simulation.** A 2015 neuroscience review identified counterfactual reasoning as explicitly dependent on "whether we allow counterfactual thought to seep into conscious thought." Mental representations of alternative possibilities provide the basis for learning from the past and planning for the future—capacities limited in great apes.

**Cumulative culture may require conscious metarepresentation.** The shift from zone-of-latent-solutions culture to cumulative ratchet culture coincides with metarepresentational capacity. If metarepresentation requires phenomenal consciousness—the explicit "knowing that you know" rather than merely feeling uncertain—then consciousness causally enables the human cultural explosion.

**Working memory expansion correlates with consciousness expansion.** The 2022 comparative review showing the 2±1 versus 7±2 gap noted that this capacity difference may be the key quantitative change enabling qualitative leaps. [Global Workspace Theory](/concepts/global-workspace-theory/) predicts this: conscious access broadcasts information globally, integrating modular unconscious processes. Expanded working memory may reflect expanded conscious integration.

## The Unconscious Cognition Counterevidence

The baseline cognition hypothesis must account for evidence that sophisticated processing proceeds without consciousness. Blindsight patients discriminate visual stimuli they report not seeing. Implicit learning acquires complex patterns without conscious knowledge of the rules. Expert performance in sports and music often degrades when conscious attention intrudes.

Yet these cases demonstrate *automatic* cognition, not *novel* cognition. Blindsight shows that visual processing pathways can operate without awareness, but patients cannot use blindsight vision for flexible problem-solving—only for forced-choice discrimination. Implicit learning acquires statistical patterns but cannot apply abstract rules to new domains. Expert automaticity develops through conscious practice that becomes proceduralized; the initial learning required consciousness.

Global Workspace Theory captures this distinction: unconscious processing is fast, parallel, and reliable within its domain; conscious processing is slow, serial, and error-prone but *flexible*. Consciousness enables responses to novel circumstances that exceed automatic repertoires. This is precisely what the baseline cognition hypothesis predicts: neural processing can achieve sophisticated automatic functions (the ape baseline) but requires consciousness for the flexible, generative, cumulative capacities that characterize human intelligence. See [conscious-vs-unconscious-processing](/concepts/conscious-vs-unconscious-processing/) for detailed analysis of what conscious processing specifically enables.

## The Illusionist Challenge

[Illusionism](/concepts/illusionism/) poses a fundamental objection: if phenomenal consciousness doesn't exist—if qualia are introspective illusions—then the baseline/human distinction cannot involve phenomenal consciousness. Great apes and humans would differ only in information-processing sophistication, not in possession of a qualitatively different kind of inner life.

The illusionist can accept that humans have capacities apes lack (metarepresentation, cumulative culture, logical reasoning) while denying that these require *phenomenal* consciousness. Perhaps higher-order representations that *seem* phenomenal achieve these functions without there being "something it is like" to have them. The "seeming" would be another representation, not evidence of genuine phenomenal properties.

**Response from the argument from reason:** The [argument-from-reason](/topics/argument-from-reason/) provides a decisive counter to illusionism here. If our beliefs about consciousness are produced by neural processes that don't track rational relationships—if we believe in qualia merely because our introspective systems misrepresent brain states—then our belief in *illusionism* has no rational justification either. The illusionist trusts their reasoning about consciousness being illusory, but if physicalism is true and no mental states track normative (rational) relationships, then the illusionist's conclusion is caused rather than justified.

More directly: the transition from baseline to human cognition involves *reasoning*—logical inference, counterfactual evaluation, understanding that conclusions follow from premises. If this reasoning requires consciousness (as the evidence suggests), and if reasoning that tracks logical relationships cannot be purely physical (as the argument from reason contends), then the baseline/human gap provides empirical evidence against illusionism. We don't merely have different representational sophistication; we have access to the "space of reasons" that physical causation alone cannot explain.

## The Mysterian Caveat

Even if consciousness causally enables the transition from baseline to human cognition, understanding *why* it does so may exceed our cognitive capacities. [Colin McGinn's cognitive closure hypothesis](/concepts/mysterianism/) suggests that humans may be permanently unable to grasp how consciousness relates to neural activity—not because the relationship is supernatural, but because the relevant concepts lie outside our cognitive architecture.

The baseline cognition hypothesis identifies *that* consciousness makes a difference without explaining *how*. We observe that logical reasoning, cumulative culture, and metarepresentation emerge alongside expanded conscious capacity, but the mechanism linking phenomenal consciousness to these functions remains opaque. Why should there being "something it is like" to hold premises enable grasping that a conclusion follows? The connection seems necessary (given the argument from reason) but mysterious.

This caveat doesn't undermine the hypothesis—it locates the remaining mystery. Great apes may represent what *can* be achieved without crossing whatever threshold consciousness provides. Humans cross that threshold. But the nature of the threshold itself may be cognitively closed to beings like us. What we observe is the *effect* of consciousness on cognition; the *mechanism* may lie beyond our grasp.

## Relation to Site Perspective

### Bidirectional Interaction

The Unfinishable Map's [Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction) tenet asserts that consciousness causally influences the physical world. The baseline cognition hypothesis provides supporting evidence: if great apes represent what neurons can do alone, and the transition to human cognition requires consciousness, then consciousness is causally necessary for human-level intelligence.

This challenges [epiphenomenalism](/arguments/epiphenomenalism/)—the view that consciousness is a causally inert byproduct. If the human cognitive leap from procedural to declarative metacognition, from automatic to flexible reasoning, from latent-solutions culture to cumulative culture, all require conscious processing, then consciousness has downstream causal effects. The very existence of logical reasoning and cumulative culture in humans but not apes suggests consciousness is doing explanatory work.

### Dualism

The [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism) tenet gains support if metarepresentation—the cognitive threshold separating ape from human intelligence—requires phenomenal consciousness and cannot be achieved by functional states alone. The [argument-from-reason](/topics/argument-from-reason/) provides the connection: grasping that a conclusion *follows from* premises involves tracking normative relationships that purely physical causation cannot instantiate. If this is correct, the metarepresentational capacity that enables cumulative culture and logical reasoning isn't merely more sophisticated information processing—it involves irreducibly conscious access to the "space of reasons."

### Minimal Quantum Interaction

The [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) tenet suggests a mechanism: if consciousness biases quantum outcomes in neural systems, expanded working memory and flexible reasoning might reflect consciousness selecting among superposed neural patterns. [Voluntary attention control](/voluntary-attention/)—a distinctively human capacity—could be where this selection operates. The quantum Zeno effect, as developed by [Stapp](/concepts/stapp-quantum-mind/), proposes that mental attention acts like repeated observation, holding desired neural patterns in place. Ape brains may provide insufficient interface for this selection, limiting them to the baseline.

### No Many Worlds

The [No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds) tenet connects to the baseline hypothesis in a subtle way. If many-worlds were correct, all possible neural configurations would be equally realized across branches—there would be no genuine selection, only branching. The very idea of consciousness "selecting" certain cognitive patterns rather than others presupposes collapse of superposition to definite outcomes. The functional difference between baseline and human cognition involves consciousness selecting among possible neural patterns; this selection is incompatible with universal branching where all options are equally actual.

### Free Will and Agent Causation

The metarepresentational threshold connects to [free-will](/concepts/free-will/) and [agent-causation](/concepts/agent-causation/). Humans don't merely respond to stimuli through fixed mappings; we deliberate, consider alternatives, and choose based on reasons. This deliberative capacity—absent in great apes—may be where consciousness exercises agent causation. The ability to hold multiple options in mind (expanded working memory), evaluate them against criteria (logical reasoning), and select based on that evaluation (flexible response) constitutes the phenomenology of free choice. If this capacity requires consciousness and cannot be achieved by unconscious processing alone, free will is not illusory but functionally essential.

### Occam's Razor Has Limits

The hypothesis illustrates the [limits of Occam's Razor](/tenets/#occams-limits). Materialism seems simpler—why posit non-physical consciousness when neurons alone might suffice? But if neurons alone produce ape-level cognition and the human leap requires something additional, parsimony may mislead. The apparent simplicity of "neurons all the way down" could reflect ignorance of what consciousness contributes, not insight into its irrelevance. The comparative evidence suggests the simpler theory (neurons suffice) is empirically inadequate.
