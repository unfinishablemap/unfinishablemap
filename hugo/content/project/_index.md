The Unfinishable Map is a philosophical content platform exploring the nature and meaning of life. The project combines human insight with AI-assisted research to build a coherent worldview expressed through structured content.

## Architecture

The data flows through these components:
- **Obsidian vault** - Primary content source (Markdown files with frontmatter)
- **Python sync tools** - Converts Obsidian wikilinks to Hugo markdown links
- **Hugo** - Static site generator that builds HTML from content
- **Netlify** - Hosts the static site
