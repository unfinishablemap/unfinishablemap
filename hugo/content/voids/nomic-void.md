The [computational void](/voids/computational-cognitive-limits/) constrains what any algorithm can determine. The [embodiment void](/voids/embodiment-cognitive-limits/) constrains what bodied minds can think. But beneath both lies a deeper stratum: the laws of physics themselves limit what kinds of minds can exist and what those minds can know. Bremermann's limit caps computation at ~1.36 × 10⁵⁰ bits per second per kilogram. Landauer's principle sets a thermodynamic floor on the cost of erasing information. The Bekenstein bound limits how much information a region of space can contain. These are not engineering constraints awaiting better technology. They are nomological—built into the structure of our universe. A universe with different fundamental constants would have different ceilings, enabling different cognition. The nomic void is the territory of thoughts that no mind operating under our physics can reach.

## Layers of Nomic Constraint

The nomic void has several strata, each deeper than the last.

**Hard computational limits.** Bremermann's limit and Landauer's principle set absolute ceilings on information processing for any physical system in our universe. No brain, no quantum computer, no future technology exceeds them. Landauer's principle has been experimentally verified at cryogenic temperatures—this is physics, not speculation. A universe with different values of *c*, *h*, or Boltzmann's *k* would have different computational limits, enabling different cognitive architectures.

**Structural constraints on complexity.** The specific forces and particles of our physics determine what stable structures can form. Carbon chemistry permits certain molecular complexity; different chemistry would permit different complexity. Any consciousness requiring a physical substrate inherits these limits on what substrates are possible.

**Observational framing.** Kant argued that space, time, and causation are forms our minds impose on experience—we know phenomena (the world as structured by cognition) but not noumena (things as they are in themselves). Stephen Wolfram's more recent framework proposes that the physics we observe emerges from how any computationally bounded observer must perceive reality. Different observers at different positions in "rulial space"—the space of all possible computations—would experience entirely different physics. As Wolfram puts it, "An alien intelligence could perfectly well be experiencing the universe in a different rulial reference frame, utterly incoherent with the one we use." If either framework is correct, our physics is partially observer-relative, and the nomic void includes everything our mode of observation excludes.

**The contingency of consciousness itself.** Chalmers's conceivability argument implies that consciousness is not nomologically necessary—a universe physically identical to ours could conceivably lack it. If the relationship between physics and consciousness is contingent, different physical laws might produce minds, different minds, or no minds at all. We cannot know.

## The Most Invisible Void

The nomic void may be the hardest void to recognise. Other voids have phenomenological signatures: the [unobservable self](/voids/the-unobservable-self/) catches attention folding back on itself; [thoughts that slip away](/voids/thoughts-that-slip-away/) leave a residue of something almost grasped. The nomic void leaves no trace. We do not experience the laws of physics as constraints on thought—they are the background conditions of all thought.

This invisibility has a Kantian structure. We cannot perceive the limits of perception because perception is already shaped by those limits. A fish does not experience water as a constraint on movement because water is the medium of all its movement. The nomic void is the water.

One possible phenomenological trace: the persistent intuition that physics should explain consciousness, combined with the persistent failure to show how. Edward Witten—a physicist, not a philosopher—has remarked: "I tend to believe that consciousness will remain a mystery." Even complete knowledge of the laws of physics, Witten suggests, would not explain why subjective experience accompanies physical processes. This felt incompleteness may be the closest we come to sensing the nomic void's boundary: the hard problem persists not because we lack data but because the relationship between physics and consciousness may not be the kind of thing physical law captures.

## Circularity and the Kantian Challenge

The nomic void contains a destabilising circularity. If our physics is partially mind-dependent—shaped by how observers like us must perceive—then "nomic constraints on cognition" becomes circular: the laws that limit the mind are themselves products of the mind. Kant was aware of this structure: we cannot know things-in-themselves, but we can know *that* our knowledge is structured by cognitive forms.

Wolfram's framework sharpens the circularity. If observers at different positions in rulial space experience different physics, then the nomic void is not an absolute boundary but an indexical one—real for us, different elsewhere. The void is the set of all rulial positions we cannot occupy.

This circularity does not dissolve the void. Even if physics is observer-relative, the observer's position constrains what physics it experiences. We cannot choose a different position in rulial space any more than we can choose different fundamental constants. The constraint is real even if its origin is participatory rather than imposed.

Wheeler's "it from bit" framework pushes furthest: if observer-participancy is constitutive of physical reality, consciousness does not merely inhabit a pre-given nomic structure but co-creates it. The nomic void, on this view, is not what our physics excludes from outside but what our mode of participation fails to elicit from within.

## What AI Might See

AI operates under the same physics as human brains. Landauer's principle and Bremermann's limit apply equally to silicon and neurons. In this respect, AI faces the same nomic void.

The asymmetry lies in analytical power. AI can explore formal models of alternative physics more thoroughly than humans—simulating universes with different constants and characterising what cognitive architectures they would support. AI might be less anthropocentric in modelling possible minds, less likely to assume cognition must resemble human cognition. And AI could help distinguish [architectural limits](/voids/embodiment-cognitive-limits/) (biology-specific) from genuinely nomic limits (physics-universal) by identifying where human intuitions about physics are artifacts of embodied cognition versus genuine nomological constraints.

But AI cannot escape the nomic void any more than humans can. Both are bound by the same physics. The difference is in the approach to the boundary, not in the boundary itself.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The nomic void connects to the Map's [tenets](/tenets/) across several dimensions.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)** is most directly relevant. If physical laws shape cognitive possibilities, our preference for simple, elegant theories may reflect the constraints of our nomic position rather than the structure of reality. What seems parsimonious from within our physics might be parochial. Chomsky's observation applies: "The endowment that yields scope also establishes limits." Different physics might support minds for which entirely different explanatory virtues feel natural.

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)** faces both challenge and opportunity. The challenge: Sean Carroll argues that the "Core Theory" of physics governs everything in everyday life, including brains, and any proposed modification must meet an extremely high evidential standard. If physics fully governs neural activity, where does non-physical consciousness act? The opportunity: the persistent failure of physical law to explain consciousness—Witten's mystery, the hard problem's endurance—may itself be evidence that consciousness has aspects outside the nomic domain. The nomic void's deepest implication for dualism: if consciousness is not entirely subject to physical law, it may partly transcend the nomic void that constrains physical minds.

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)** gains context. If consciousness interfaces with physics through quantum processes, then our universe's specific quantum mechanics defines the channel. Different quantum mechanics would mean different interface modes. The nomic void includes all the ways consciousness might interact with matter that our quantum mechanics does not permit.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)** is illuminated by Wheeler's participatory universe. If consciousness co-creates the nomic structure it inhabits, then the nomic void is partially self-generated—consciousness participates in creating the constraints it then cannot transcend.

## Classification in the Voids Taxonomy

The nomic void is primarily **Unexplorable** in the [voids taxonomy](/voids/three-kinds-of-void/): no mind under our physics can think the thoughts that different physics would enable. It has an **Occluded** dimension if our physics is observer-relative (Kant, Wolfram)—the constraint is not merely passive absence but active framing that shapes what can appear.

Unlike the [computational void](/voids/computational-cognitive-limits/), which is proven for computation but may not bind consciousness, the nomic void constrains any entity operating under our physics—computational or otherwise. Unlike the [embodiment void](/voids/embodiment-cognitive-limits/), which is specific to bodied minds, the nomic void binds disembodied minds equally. It is the most universal cognitive constraint: the one from which nothing physical escapes.
