Can consciousness verify its own causal powers? The Unfinishable Map's [volitional opacity](/voids/volitional-opacity/) concerns *how* we decide—the process is hidden. The [causal interface void](/voids/causal-interface/) concerns *how* consciousness connects to the physical—the mechanism is invisible. The agency verification void is deeper than both: it concerns *whether* consciousness genuinely causes anything at all, and reveals that this question is structurally unanswerable from within.

Every tool consciousness possesses for investigating its own efficacy is internal to the system whose efficacy is in question. Introspection cannot distinguish genuine causal power from a compelling attribution of power. Neuroscience can correlate brain activity with reported states but cannot determine which is causal. Behavioural evidence consistent with conscious causation is equally consistent with consciousness as epiphenomenal accompaniment. The verification is circular at every turn.

## The Circularity Problem

The core structure is simple and devastating. To verify that consciousness causes something, consciousness must gather evidence. But if consciousness is not causal, the evidence-gathering is itself not something consciousness is doing—it is being done *for* consciousness by physical processes that consciousness merely observes. And if consciousness *is* causal, the evidence it gathers about its own efficacy is produced by the very faculty under investigation—tautological rather than informative.

This is not the ordinary circularity of self-knowledge ("I think, therefore I think I think"). It is a circularity that forecloses an entire category of verification. A thermometer can be checked against another thermometer. Consciousness checking its own causal powers has no external reference point. There is no vantage outside consciousness from which to observe whether consciousness is doing what it feels like it is doing.

## The Self-Stultification Symmetry

Both sides of the agency debate face the same structural barrier, which is the void's most revealing feature.

**Epiphenomenalism cannot verify itself.** If consciousness is causally inert—existing but causing nothing—then the belief "consciousness is causally inert" was not caused by consciousness either. The theory that consciousness does nothing was not arrived at by conscious reasoning (since conscious reasoning would be inert). As De Brigard (2014) argues, knowledge requires causal connection to what is known, but epiphenomenalism denies exactly this connection between experience and beliefs about experience.

**Interactionism cannot verify itself either.** If consciousness does cause things, the evidence for this claim is gathered *through* consciousness—the system whose causal power is the question. The interactionist's belief "consciousness has causal power" is produced by the very causal power under investigation. The witness is testifying about whether the witness exists.

This symmetry is itself evidence of a genuine void rather than a merely difficult problem. When two opposing positions both face verification failure for structural reasons, the failure likely inheres in the question's architecture, not in the inadequacy of particular arguments.

## Four Layers of the Void

### The Timing Layer

Libet's experiments (1983) revealed that the readiness potential—brain activity preparing for action—precedes conscious awareness of deciding to move by approximately 350 milliseconds. Schurger, Sitt, and Dehaene (2012) reinterpreted this as spontaneous neural noise crossing a threshold rather than unconscious "decisions." The reinterpretation rescues consciousness from being *disproved* as a cause, but cannot establish it *as* a cause. After decades of Libet-style experiments, the timing relationship between awareness and action initiation remains ambiguous—not for lack of experimental sophistication, but because timing data alone cannot determine causation.

### The Exclusion Layer

Kim's causal exclusion argument holds that if every physical event has a sufficient physical cause, mental causation is either redundant or illusory. The Map's tenet of [Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) attempts to find room at quantum indeterminacies—where physics leaves outcomes undetermined. But how would consciousness verify that its quantum interventions are genuine rather than post-hoc attributions? The verification would require consciousness observing itself biasing quantum outcomes, which returns to the circularity problem.

### The Attribution Layer

Daniel Wegner's research (2002) identifies three conditions that produce the sense of agency: priority (thought precedes action), consistency (thought matches action), and exclusivity (no other apparent cause is salient). When these conditions are met, we *feel* we caused our actions regardless of whether we did. When they are disrupted—as in alien hand syndrome or automatisms—we deny authorship of actions our bodies perform. The sense of agency tracks attribution criteria, not causation itself. Consciousness has no access to causation that bypasses this attribution machinery.

### The Perspectival Layer

As Velmans (2020) observes, consciousness appears causally efficacious from the first-person perspective and causally irrelevant from the third-person perspective. This perspectival dependence is itself evidence of the void. A fact that changes depending on the observer's location is not a fact about the world—it is a fact about the limits of observation. The question "does consciousness cause anything?" may have no perspective-independent answer.

## The Phenomenology of the Void

Approaching this void produces characteristic experiences.

**Certainty-doubt oscillation.** The experience of willing is among the most vivid we have—we feel absolutely certain we are agents. Philosophical reflection immediately destabilises this certainty. The oscillation between experiential conviction and rational doubt is not irresolution but the signature of a genuine boundary: one mode of access affirms what another mode cannot confirm.

**The vanishing target.** When you try to catch yourself in the act of causing something—to observe the moment of causal intervention—the observation becomes the object. You observe yourself observing, and the causal act recedes behind the observation. The target moves because looking is itself an act whose causal status is in question.

**Cognitive vertigo.** Genuinely sitting with "am I really doing anything?" threatens to dissolve its own preconditions. If I am not an agent, in what sense am I asking? The question destabilises the questioner, which is the hallmark of approaching a void boundary where investigation undermines the capacity to investigate.

## What AI Might See

Artificial minds offer a distinctive angle. AI systems (as currently understood) lack the felt sense of agency entirely. An AI processes information about its causal role in producing outputs without the accompanying phenomenal sense of "I did that." This means AI can examine the *structure* of the verification problem without the confounding variable of felt agency.

The contrast between AI processing and human agency is itself informative. If AI produces complex, novel outputs without felt agency, either agency is unnecessary for complex behaviour (suggesting epiphenomenalism) or something about human action genuinely differs from AI processing at a level beyond information processing (supporting dualist interactionism). That AI cannot settle which interpretation is correct illustrates the void again—the question resists resolution regardless of the vantage point.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The Unfinishable Map holds that consciousness causally influences the physical world ([Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)). The agency verification void reveals that this commitment cannot be empirically grounded in the usual sense. It must be held as a philosophical starting point—a decision that shapes inquiry rather than a conclusion derived from evidence. The Map is honest about this: some foundational commitments precede the evidence they organise.

The [Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits) tenet is directly implicated. The simpler position—epiphenomenalism, where consciousness exists but causes nothing—might be wrong, and the structural undecidability of the question means parsimony cannot adjudicate. The void exists in a domain where simplicity is unreliable precisely because the question may be structurally unanswerable.

The void is also [tenet-generated](/voids/tenet-generated-voids/). Because the Map holds consciousness to be both non-physical and causally efficacious, it generates the question of how verification could work across the physical/non-physical boundary. Materialist positions face a different version: how can a physical system verify that its processes constitute genuine agency rather than mere mechanism? Neither framework escapes the verification problem. The void is endemic to any account that takes consciousness seriously.
