title: Tenet-Generated Voids
topics: []
---

Every philosophical framework generates its own voids—questions it points toward but cannot answer. The Unfinishable Map's five [tenets](/tenets/) are no exception. By accepting certain commitments about consciousness, causation, and identity, the Map necessarily leaves certain questions unanswerable from within its own structure. This is not a criticism but an application of the Map's own principles: the fifth tenet, [Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits), acknowledges that our conceptual tools may be inadequate. Recognising framework-generated voids is intellectual honesty, not concession.

The shape of what a framework cannot answer reveals something about its structure—and perhaps about the territory it attempts to map.

## The Five Voids

Each tenet generates its characteristic void—a question the tenet points toward but cannot resolve.

### Dualism: The Nature Void

**What the tenet says**: Consciousness is irreducible to physical processes.

**What it cannot answer**: What *is* the irreducible non-physical aspect?

Dualism establishes that consciousness cannot be fully explained in physical terms, but provides no positive characterisation of what consciousness *is*. The positive nature remains void. This isn't a failure of effort. Any positive description using concepts derived from physical or functional analysis will fail by definition. And we have no access to consciousness-concepts except through a consciousness that cannot fully examine itself (see [self-reference-paradox](/voids/self-reference-paradox/)).

The phenomenology of this void: hitting a wall when trying to articulate the nature of experience. "Consciousness is..." and no completion is available that doesn't reduce or merely point.

### Minimal Quantum Interaction: The Mechanism Void

**What the tenet says**: Consciousness influences physical outcomes at quantum indeterminacies, minimally.

**What it cannot answer**: *How* does a non-physical influence bias quantum probabilities?

The tenet postulates an interface between consciousness and physics but cannot explain how something non-physical—by definition lacking physical properties—can alter probability distributions over physical outcomes. Candidate mechanisms exist: [Orch OR](/concepts/quantum-consciousness/) locates quantum effects in microtubules; Stapp's quantum Zeno approach uses orthodox quantum mechanics with mental attention acting like repeated observation. But each mechanism leaves a placeholder at the crucial point: consciousness → [?] → quantum bias.

The placeholder refuses to fill because explaining it would require showing causal relations between physical and non-physical realms. Causal relations, as we understand them, involve physical processes. The mechanism lies outside our conceptual resources.

### Bidirectional Interaction: The Detection Void

**What the tenet says**: Consciousness causally influences physical outcomes.

**What it cannot answer**: Why can't we detect the influence?

If consciousness biases quantum outcomes in the brain, this should be statistically detectable. Yet the tenet requires effects simultaneously real and undetectable—fine-tuning that seems suspicious.

The parallel to divine hiddenness is instructive. Theologians face the question: if a loving God exists, why isn't the evidence clearer? The Map's non-physical consciousness has a similar structure: causally efficacious but empirically silent. The Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet provides a principled answer (the interaction is *exactly* minimal), but this generates its own void: why exactly minimal? The fine-tuning cries out for explanation that the framework cannot provide.

### No Many Worlds: The Selection Void

**What the tenet says**: Many-worlds interpretation is rejected; quantum measurements yield single outcomes.

**What it cannot answer**: What selects the single outcome in general?

If not all branches are realised, something selects which one becomes actual. If consciousness participates in this selection, what selected outcomes before consciousness existed? Stars formed, chemistry proceeded, mutations accumulated—billions of years before the first mind. The [prebiotic collapse problem](/concepts/prebiotic-collapse/) demands an answer.

The tenets article addresses this via "objective reduction with consciousness modulation"—physical mechanisms (gravitational collapse, spontaneous localisation, unknown processes) provide baseline collapse throughout the universe, while consciousness modulates outcomes locally where brains provide the right interface. But this resolution generates new voids: What are these physical mechanisms? How does consciousness "modulate" them? Why do they produce determinate outcomes without observation? The selection void multiplies rather than resolves.

Beneath the mechanism question lies a deeper void: even granting that outcomes are selected, why does *this* consciousness experience *this* outcome? The [indexical void](/voids/indexical-void/) names this question—and it is the indexical problem that motivates rejecting many-worlds in the first place. The tenet cannot answer the question it was designed to protect.

### Occam's Razor Has Limits: The Meta-Void

**What the tenet says**: Simplicity is not a reliable guide to truth when knowledge is incomplete.

**What it cannot answer**: How do we know when to trust simplicity and when to distrust it?

The tenet warns against over-reliance on parsimony but provides no alternative criterion. We cannot use simplicity to reject dualism, but what *can* we use? Every framework faces this question about its own foundational commitments. Is the Map's five-tenet structure simpler than it should be? More complex? The meta-question has no stable answer from within.

This is the most reflexive void. The tenet that permits acknowledging limits is itself subject to limits—which it permits us to acknowledge—recursively. The permission to doubt includes permission to doubt the permission.

## Cross-Tenet Voids

Some voids emerge from the *interaction* between tenets rather than individual commitments.

**The Coherence Void**: Do the five tenets form a consistent system? The Map argues they do, but consistency is difficult to prove for informal frameworks. Gödelian considerations suggest sufficiently rich systems contain propositions whose truth cannot be decided within the system. The Map's consistency may be such a proposition—meaningful to ask, impossible to determine from inside.

**The Completeness Void**: Are five tenets enough? Too many? The Map provides no meta-criterion for determining what foundational commitments are necessary. Perhaps a sixth tenet is missing that would resolve some voids. Perhaps the five already contain contradictions we cannot see. The framework cannot specify its own boundaries.

**The Epistemic Privilege Void**: The Map claims consciousness is fundamental and causally efficacious, yet acknowledges we cannot detect its causal effects or characterise its nature. This creates a position structurally similar to unfalsifiable claims—true by stipulation, defended by appealing to our limited epistemic position. How is this different from motivated reasoning in philosophical clothing? The distinguishing criterion may be this: motivated reasoning *hides* from challenges, while the Map catalogues them. But whether this transparency is sufficient remains itself a void—the framework's own resources cannot fully resolve whether its methodology is genuine intellectual honesty or sophisticated self-protection.

## The Nature of These Limits

These voids are predominantly **Unexplorable** rather than merely Unexplored:

They don't reflect questions we haven't answered through insufficient effort. The interaction problem has persisted for nearly 400 years since Princess Elisabeth posed it to Descartes in 1643. No satisfying answer exists today. This persistence suggests structural difficulty, not historical contingency.

The voids reflect questions that *cannot be answered* given the conceptual resources available. The framework itself—by making certain commitments—closes off certain answers. Accepting that consciousness is non-physical precludes physical characterisation. Accepting that interaction is minimal precludes empirical detection. The commitments that give the Map its distinctive perspective also generate its characteristic blind spots.

But some may be **Occluded** in a deeper sense. If consciousness participates in its own examination, it may systematically fail to see certain features of itself. If simplicity preferences are cognitive biases, we may systematically avoid recognising complexity that is actually there. The Map's commitments may create motivated reasoning that defends itself from disconfirmation. These possibilities cannot be ruled out from within.

## Why This Matters

Acknowledging tenet-generated voids serves several purposes.

**Intellectual honesty as methodology.** The fifth tenet (Occam's Razor Has Limits) explicitly warns that our conceptual tools may be inadequate. Taking this seriously means applying it to the Map itself. A framework that acknowledged no voids would violate its own principles.

**Inoculation against criticism.** Pre-cataloguing voids distinguishes the Map from dogmatic systems that ignore their problems. Critics cannot accuse the Map of hiding its gaps when the gaps are documented.

**Productive failure as data.** The inability to answer certain questions may reveal something important about consciousness, reality, or knowledge. "Where the Map cannot go" is itself cartographic information. The shape of voids constrains what consciousness and its relation to physics might be.

**Dynamic evolution.** Recognising voids permits revision. The Map should be a living document that updates as understanding develops—not a fixed creed. Some voids might shrink through new insights; others might reveal that a tenet requires modification.

## Comparative Context

Every framework generates voids. Materialism faces the [hard problem](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/)—why there is something it is like to have neural activity. Panpsychism faces the combination problem—how micro-experiences combine into unified consciousness. Idealism faces the problem of other minds and the regularity of nature. The question is not whether a framework has voids but whether it acknowledges them.

The Map's voids are distinctive, clustering around the consciousness-physics interface—mechanism, nature, selection. This pattern reveals what the Map is about: taking consciousness as fundamental generates specific questions about how it relates to the physical that current conceptual resources cannot answer.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Each tenet connects to its own void, creating a reflexive structure:

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)** generates the Nature Void but cannot be abandoned without denying the hard problem. The void is the price of taking consciousness seriously.

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction)** generates the Mechanism Void but provides the most plausible location for mind-matter interface. The void is where the interface must be.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)** generates the Detection Void but is required by our ability to discuss consciousness at all. The void marks the empirical silence of something causally real.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)** generates the Selection Void but preserves indexical identity. Consciousness's [constitutive singularity](/voids/plurality-void/)—its inability to be plural—reinforces this commitment: what cannot branch cannot split across worlds. The void is the price of taking *this* consciousness seriously.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)** generates the Meta-Void but permits acknowledging all the others. The void is the price of epistemic humility.

The pattern suggests the voids are not accidental but structural—the characteristic signature of a framework that takes consciousness as fundamental while operating with conceptual tools developed for physical description. The tools can point toward consciousness but not grasp it directly. The voids mark where pointing fails.

## What Would Challenge This Analysis?

The framework-generated-voids analysis would be undermined if:

1. **One of the voids gets filled.** If a satisfying mechanism for consciousness-quantum interaction is articulated, or the nature of the non-physical is positively characterised, the corresponding void closes. The analysis doesn't claim the voids are permanent—only that they're structural given current resources.

2. **Alternative frameworks have no voids.** If materialism, panpsychism, or another framework can be shown to answer all its questions internally, having voids becomes a defect rather than a universal condition. Current evidence suggests all frameworks have characteristic gaps.

3. **The voids prove inconsistent.** If acknowledging one void contradicts another—if the Detection Void requires abandoning Bidirectional Interaction, for instance—the framework faces a choice beyond acknowledging limits.

4. **The meta-void swallows everything.** If Occam's Razor Has Limits undermines all criteria for evaluation, the Map collapses into radical scepticism. The tenet must permit some knowledge while acknowledging limits, or it becomes self-defeating.
