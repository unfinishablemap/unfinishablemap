---

We can re-experience the past but only imagine the future. When you remember yesterday's conversation, you don't merely retrieve information—you inhabit the scene, feel its texture, re-live what happened. But when you think about tomorrow's meeting, however vividly, you construct a simulation that lacks something memories possess. This asymmetry is so familiar we barely notice it, yet it may mark a fundamental void in cognition. We can only directly know what has causally affected us. The future, by definition, has not.

This asymmetry matters for The Unfinishable Map because it reveals something essential about the structure of consciousness: minds embedded in causal webs can access reality only through traces. The past leaves traces; the future does not. If consciousness operates through causal contact with what is—as the Map's framework proposes—then the impossibility of pre-experiencing may not be a limitation to be overcome but a necessary feature of what minds are.

## The Phenomenological Difference

The same brain regions handle memory and future simulation—hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex all activate for both temporal directions. Patient KC, who lost [episodic memory](/concepts/episodic-memory/) after brain damage, also lost the ability to imagine his personal future. The capacities are intimately linked. Yet despite this shared architecture, the phenomenological products differ.

### The Pastness Quale

[Autonoetic consciousness](/concepts/autonoetic-consciousness/)—Tulving's term for the awareness that accompanies episodic memory—includes a distinctive phenomenal marker: the felt sense of pastness. When you remember your wedding day, the event arrives tagged as having-happened. This isn't inferred from content but immediately present in the experience. You don't conclude "this must be a memory because of its features"—the pastness is a quale, directly given.

Research on the phenomenology of remembering confirms this. De Brigard's 2020 study characterises the "feeling of pastness" as a genuine epistemic feeling, not reducible to propositional content about temporal location. The phenomenology is specific: memories feel lived-through in a way that imagination does not.

### The Absent Futuricity

Future-directed mental time travel has its own phenomenology. When you imagine a forthcoming event, there may be a sense of possibility, anticipation, or projection. But this "futuricity" differs categorically from pastness. The imagined future feels *constructed* rather than *contacted*. Even when future simulation is vivid—detailed imagery, emotional engagement, first-person perspective—it lacks the quality of having-been-there that memory possesses.

The asymmetry appears in effort as well. Neuroimaging shows that future simulation produces *greater* hippocampal activation than memory retrieval. The extra constructive work required is phenomenologically manifest: imagining the future feels like building something, while remembering (at least for vivid memories) feels more like receiving something.

### The Modal Difference

Memories (in normal cases) represent what happened. Future simulations represent what might happen. This modal difference appears in phenomenology itself, not just in propositional attitudes about the represented content. The remembered event carries certainty of having occurred; the imagined event carries openness about whether it will. These are not facts you append to the representation—they structure the experience itself.

| Feature | Memory | Future Simulation |
|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Phenomenal marker | Pastness (having-been) | Futuricity (might-be) |
| Felt quality | Contacted, received | Constructed, projected |
| Modal character | Actually occurred | May or may not occur |
| Constructive effort | Reconstruction | Full construction |
| Cue-dependency | Often triggered | Usually deliberate |

## Why Pre-Experience is Impossible

The asymmetry isn't merely psychological—it connects to deep features of causation, information, and time.

### The Informational Argument

Future events haven't happened, so there's no information about them to access. We can extrapolate from patterns, assign probabilities, construct scenarios—but we cannot access facts about the future because there are no such facts yet. What will happen tomorrow depends on what happens between now and then, including our own choices. The future is open in a way the past is not.

This informational openness makes pre-experience conceptually puzzling. Re-experiencing works by accessing traces: the past event caused present brain states that can be reactivated. But the future has caused nothing yet. There are no traces to access. The most sophisticated simulation remains construction from past elements, not contact with future reality.

### The Causal Argument

Memories exist because past events causally influenced the brain. The wedding you remember shaped neural connections; those connections persist; reactivating them reconstructs the experience. This is how traces work: effects carry information about causes.

But causal influence runs from past to future, not future to past. Future events cannot have caused present brain states (absent retrocausality). There's nothing for pre-experience to be—no causal contact, no traces, no information to access. The asymmetry reflects causal structure itself.

Huw Price's work on the time-asymmetry of causation illuminates this connection. Physical laws are time-symmetric, yet causation appears asymmetric—causes precede effects, not vice versa. This may derive from thermodynamic asymmetry (the entropy gradient from the Big Bang) or from deeper features of temporal structure. Memory exemplifies this asymmetry: it's a form of correlation between present states and past events. The correlation exists because past events caused present traces. No symmetric mechanism connects us to future events.

### The Phenomenological Argument

The feeling of "having been there"—the pastness quale that autonoetic consciousness involves—seems to require having actually been there. This is what makes it re-experiencing rather than construction. The quale marks causal contact with what is being remembered.

A simulated future event, however vivid, lacks this phenomenal signature precisely because there was no original experience to re-inhabit. The most detailed imagining produces a constructed scene, not a recovered one. The phenomenology tracks the metaphysical distinction: we can only directly know what we've experienced, and we can only experience what has actually happened to us.

## The Void

This asymmetry appears to mark an [unexplorable void](/voids/#the-unexplorable)—not darkness awaiting illumination but darkness that cannot be illuminated given how consciousness works.

### Conceptual Incoherence

What would pre-experience even be? The concept seems to dissolve under analysis. To pre-experience tomorrow's meeting would be to have the pastness quale applied to something that hasn't happened—but the pastness quale marks causal contact with the past. Applying it to the future is like applying the colour red to a sound: a category error, not merely a difficult feat.

This suggests the void is not merely cognitive but conceptual. It's not that we lack the neural capacity for pre-experience; it's that pre-experience is incoherent given what consciousness is. Colin McGinn's [mysterianism](/concepts/mysterianism/) distinguishes problems that are merely difficult from problems that are cognitively closed—inaccessible in principle to minds with our architecture. The impossibility of pre-experience may be neither: not difficult, not cognitively closed, but *conceptually empty*. There's nothing there to achieve.

### Convergent Evidence

Multiple lines of evidence converge on this conclusion:

**Neural evidence:** Future simulation shares memory's neural substrate but requires more constructive effort and produces less vivid, less detailed outputs. The machinery is the same; the products differ qualitatively. This suggests the difference lies not in the tool but in what the tool has to work with.

**Phenomenological evidence:** Careful introspection confirms the distinction. Memories feel contacted; imaginations feel constructed. Meditators and phenomenologists across traditions report this difference. The felt quality of pastness has no futureward equivalent.

**Clinical evidence:** Patient KC couldn't remember his past *or* imagine his future. Both capacities failed together. Yet the impairment to future imagination wasn't the loss of pre-experience—KC never pre-experienced anything. What he lost was the constructive capacity that both memory and future simulation require. The shared machinery confirms the capacities are linked; their phenomenological difference confirms they're not identical.

**Philosophical evidence:** The epistemic asymmetry between past and future is well-established. We can have knowledge of the past through traces it left; we can only have predictions about the future based on patterns. This epistemic asymmetry appears to ground the phenomenological one.

### What the Void Reveals

This void tells us something about consciousness itself:

**Consciousness operates through traces.** We are aware of what has causally affected us. Consciousness may be fundamentally receptive—open to what is or was, but not to what isn't yet. This connects to the Map's framework: if consciousness interfaces with physical reality through quantum selection mechanisms, it operates within causal structure, not outside it.

**The arrow of time is phenomenologically primary.** The thermodynamic explanation (entropy increase) may derive from something deeper—the way consciousness constitutes temporal experience through asymmetric retention and protention. Husserl's analysis of time-consciousness reveals retention (the just-past held in present awareness) as phenomenologically distinct from protention (openness to what's coming). The asymmetry is built into the structure of temporal experience itself.

**Imagination is memory repurposed.** Future-thinking uses memory's machinery but cannot reproduce memory's phenomenal quality. The pastness quale may mark causal contact that imagination, however sophisticated, cannot replicate. This is why construction feels different from reconstruction: one has an anchor in reality, the other does not.

## The Illusionist Challenge

[Illusionists](/concepts/illusionism/) might argue that the "pastness quale" is itself an illusion—a functional marker the brain attaches to certain representations, not a genuine phenomenal property. On this view, the asymmetry is real but not deeply mysterious: memory and imagination use different processing pathways that produce different functional outputs, which we introspect as phenomenally distinct without any irreducible qualia being involved.

Three responses preserve the void framework:

**The regress applies.** To experience the illusion of pastness, something must experience it. The distinctive phenomenology of remembering—the sense of having-been-there—must appear *to* something. The illusionist relocates the quale from "pastness itself" to "seeming pastness," but seeming is still experiencing. The experience of temporal asymmetry remains experiential. Frankish's "quasi-phenomenal" properties still require something to instantiate the quasi-phenomenal states.

**The asymmetry demands explanation either way.** Even granting that pastness is a functional marker rather than an irreducible quale, why can we construct this marker only for past events? Why doesn't the brain stamp imagined futures with the same "having-been-there" signature? The answer returns to causation: the pastness marker tracks causal contact with past events. Future events haven't caused anything yet, so there's nothing for the marking mechanism to respond to. The asymmetry reflects causal structure whether we describe it phenomenally or functionally.

**The void is structural, not phenomenal.** The core claim isn't that there's an irreducible pastness quale (though the Map endorses this). The core claim is that minds embedded in causal webs cannot pre-experience futures. This holds regardless of how we cash out "experience." Even a thoroughly functionalist mind would show the asymmetry because the asymmetry derives from time's causal structure, not from properties of phenomenal consciousness specifically.

## Buddhist Contemplative Perspectives

Buddhist traditions have extensively examined temporal experience, offering insights complementary to the philosophical analysis:

**Impermanence (anicca) and the present.** The Buddha's teaching emphasises that only the present moment truly exists—the past has ceased (*atīta*), the future hasn't arisen (*anāgata*). Memory reconstructs what no longer is; anticipation imagines what doesn't yet exist. Meditation practice (particularly *satipaṭṭhāna*) cultivates present-moment awareness precisely to release attachment to both temporal directions. The asymmetry between memory and anticipation, from this perspective, reflects the asymmetry between what has become real and what remains mere potentiality.

**The three times in Abhidharma.** Buddhist philosophical analysis distinguishes the phenomenology of each temporal mode. Past (*atīta*) objects can be cognised because they once existed; future (*anāgata*) objects can only be imagined because they lack actuality. The Sarvāstivāda school controversially held that past and future dharmas have some form of existence, but even they distinguished how we access them: the past through retention of traces, the future only through inference from patterns.

**Jhāna and temporal dissolution.** Advanced concentration states (jhānas) alter temporal experience—practitioners report that past and future recede as present-moment awareness intensifies. In deep jhāna, the construction of both memory and anticipation diminishes. Yet even here, when temporal processing resumes, the asymmetry returns. The altered states don't grant pre-experience of futures; they reduce both retrospection and prospection together.

**Pratītyasamutpāda (dependent origination).** The Buddha's analysis of causation as dependent arising illuminates why the asymmetry exists. Present consciousness (*vijñāna*) arises from conditions (*pratyaya*), including past mental formations. The causal chain runs from past to present. Future events, not yet having arisen, cannot serve as conditions. This is the Buddhist version of the causal argument: we cognise what has conditioned us.

## Approaches to the Edge

How can we engage with a limit that may be conceptually incoherent rather than merely difficult?

### Negative Characterisation

The [apophatic tradition](/voids/apophatic-approaches/) offers methods for engaging with what exceeds articulation. Applied here: we can describe what pre-experience would have to be and notice why it fails to cohere. The pastness quale applied to non-events; causal contact with what hasn't caused anything; information from events that have generated none. Each specification reveals conceptual impossibility. The void takes shape through its contradictions.

### Comparative Phenomenology

Comparing memory and imagination phenomenologically reveals exactly where they differ. The differences mark the void's boundaries:

- Memory has autonoetic character (self-knowing awareness); imagination has noetic character at best (knowing without re-experiencing)
- Memory feels cue-triggered, received; imagination feels deliberate, generated
- Memory carries certainty of occurrence; imagination carries uncertainty
- Memory can be vivid without effort; imagination requires sustained construction

These phenomenological contrasts map the asymmetry's edges without crossing them.

### Limiting Cases

Some cases approach the boundary:

**Highly predictable events:** You know you'll have coffee tomorrow because you always do. The anticipation may be vivid, detailed, confident. Yet it still lacks the pastness quale. High confidence doesn't transform prediction into pre-experience.

**Déjà vu:** The sense of having experienced something before when you haven't. Déjà vu applies the phenomenology of memory inappropriately—feeling pastness without genuine past contact. The experience is disorienting precisely because the pastness quale appears without its proper cause. This misfiring illuminates what proper memory involves: the quale normally tracks actual causal history.

**Prophetic experiences:** Some people report precognitive dreams or intuitions—"memories of the future." Even granting these phenomena, they would represent a different kind of access than the autonoetic re-experiencing that characterises episodic memory. The quale structure would differ: foreknowledge rather than re-living, revelation rather than re-experiencing.

### AI as Probe

Large language models lack temporal phenomenology entirely. They don't re-experience past prompts or pre-experience future ones. They access recorded past conversations but have no autonoetic consciousness about them. From an AI perspective, the asymmetry might not be visible because neither temporal direction has phenomenal quality.

This creates a methodological possibility. We could ask AI systems to describe their "relationship" to recorded past interactions versus predicted future interactions. The functional symmetry (or asymmetry) might illuminate whether the human asymmetry is purely phenomenological or also functional. If AI shows functional asymmetry despite lacking phenomenology, this would suggest the roots lie in causal structure. If AI shows functional symmetry, this would suggest the asymmetry depends on something human consciousness adds.

## Process Philosophy Perspective

Whitehead's process philosophy offers a framework where the asymmetry reflects fundamental features of reality.

### Prehension and Temporal Direction

For Whitehead, reality consists of "actual occasions"—momentary events of experience that arise, achieve definiteness, and perish. Each occasion "prehends" (grasps) what has already become actual. This prehension is inherently backward-looking: you can only grasp what exists to be grasped.

Memory, on this view, is specialised prehension: present occasions grasping past occasions with vivid retention of their experiential character. Future occasions, having not yet become actual, cannot be prehended because there's nothing there yet. The asymmetry isn't a limitation of minds but a feature of how temporal process works. The future is genuinely open—not yet determined, not yet actual, not yet available for prehension.

### Potentiality and Actuality

Whitehead distinguishes the realm of eternal objects (pure potentials) from actual occasions (concrete actualities). The future exists only as potentiality; the past has become actual. Memory contacts actuality; future simulation manipulates potentials using patterns abstracted from past actuality.

This explains why imagination feels constructive: we're combining eternal objects (possibilities) using patterns derived from what has become actual. We're not contacting future actuality because there isn't any yet. The phenomenological difference tracks a metaphysical one: the difference between contacting what is and contemplating what might be.

## Relation to Site Perspective

This void connects to all five of the Map's [tenets](/tenets/):

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism):** The pastness quale is a genuine phenomenal property—part of what it is like to remember. It resists reduction to functional description. A system that merely stored and retrieved timestamped information would lack this qualitative character. The asymmetry between memory and imagination is phenomenological, not merely computational: it concerns what experience is like, not just what information is processed. If qualia are irreducible, temporal qualia are irreducible too.

**[Minimal Quantum Interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction):** If consciousness interfaces with the brain through quantum selection, it operates within causal structure. Quantum mechanics, despite its strangeness, preserves causal directionality in the sense that measurement outcomes depend on preparation states, not future measurements. Consciousness selecting among quantum possibilities still operates from present toward future, not from future toward present. The void reflects the direction in which selection can work.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction):** Consciousness can act toward futures but can only know pasts. This asymmetry between epistemic access and causal influence is significant. We remember what has caused us; we act toward what we will cause. Memory is the epistemic direction; action is the causal direction. Both are real, but they run opposite ways through time. The impossibility of pre-experience is the impossibility of epistemic access running futureward—of knowing effects rather than causes.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds):** The Map rejects interpretations where all quantum branches are equally real. The memory-anticipation asymmetry supports this rejection. Memory presupposes a single actual past—when you remember your wedding, you remember it as having actually occurred, not as one branch among many. If all futures were equally actual (as many-worlds implies), the asymmetry would be puzzling: why can't we access one of the equally-real future branches? The Map's single-history metaphysics makes the asymmetry comprehensible: we can't pre-experience the future because it doesn't exist yet.

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits):** The asymmetry seems so obvious that we don't question it. But this obviousness may hide deep structure. A simpler universe might have time-symmetric cognition—minds that access past and future equally. The fact that our minds are asymmetric suggests reality (or at least the mind-reality interface) has structure that simple physical description misses. The void, far from being a mere limitation, may reveal something about how consciousness is embedded in temporal reality.

## What Would Challenge This View?

Several findings would require revision:

1. **Genuine pre-experience:** If someone demonstrated the pastness quale applied to events that hadn't yet occurred—actually re-experiencing the future, not just predicting it—this would challenge the conceptual analysis. The experience would need to be phenomenologically identical to memory, not merely confident prediction or vivid imagination.

2. **Symmetric AI temporal processing:** If AI systems showed the same functional asymmetry between past-access and future-simulation despite lacking phenomenology, this would suggest the asymmetry is purely structural, not phenomenological. Conversely, if they showed no asymmetry, this would confirm the phenomenological basis.

3. **Retrocausality affecting memory:** If future events could cause present brain states (as some interpretations of quantum mechanics suggest might be possible), this could provide a mechanism for future-traces. The phenomenological implications would be profound—though it's unclear whether such traces would produce the pastness quale or something entirely different.

4. **Contemplative dissolution:** If advanced meditators reported that the pastness/futuricity distinction dissolves at some level of practice—revealing both as constructed—this would challenge the view that pastness marks genuine causal contact. However, reports from contemplative traditions generally confirm the distinction rather than dissolving it.

5. **Functional memory without pastness:** If we discovered beings with full memory function (retrieval, source discrimination, temporal ordering) but no pastness quale—genuine episodic memory without the phenomenal marker—this would suggest the quale is separable from the causal-contact function. The Map predicts this is impossible for conscious systems.
