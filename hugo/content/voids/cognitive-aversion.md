Some thoughts we cannot think. Others we will not. Cognitive aversion names the second category: thoughts we systematically fail to sustain—not because they exceed our cognitive architecture, but because something deflects us. Where Colin McGinn's [mysterianism](/concepts/mysterianism/) describes minds architecturally closed to certain properties, cognitive aversion describes minds motivationally closed—concepts perhaps formable in principle, but systematically unthought in practice.

This is the territory between the [Unexplored and the Occluded](/voids/three-kinds-of-void/). The question for the [voids framework](/voids/): Is this resistance merely psychological and thus overcomable, or does it reveal something structural about consciousness itself?

## The Evidence for Systematic Avoidance

### Terror Management Theory

Over 500 empirical studies document systematic behavioural changes when death is made salient. Cultural worldviews and self-esteem serve what researchers call an "anxiety-buffering function" against existential terror. Reminders of death—even subliminal ones—increase worldview defence, in-group bias, and punishment of perceived moral transgressions.

The subliminal effect is crucial. Participants whose death-awareness is activated below conscious threshold still show measurable behavioural changes. This avoidance operates before thought fully forms. We do not consciously decide to flee death-thoughts; the deflection precedes awareness.

### Heidegger on Falling and Fleeing

Martin Heidegger's analysis of "fallenness" describes how Dasein (being-there, roughly the human mode of existence) evades its own nature. We surrender ourselves to the "they-self"—anonymous social existence—and thereby flee from confronting our own being-towards-death.

The evasion is structurally determined. Dasein's "plunge into inauthenticity is not merely possible, but structurally determined." Inauthenticity is not moral failure but the default mode of human existence. Authentic confrontation with death—what Heidegger calls "anticipation"—requires running *toward* what we naturally flee. Such authenticity is rare and effortful.

### Becker and the Denial of Death

Ernest Becker argued that "consciousness of death is the primary repression, not sexuality"—a fundamental departure from Freud. Death anxiety is not merely uncomfortable but must be "positively repressed." The unconscious expends enormous energy on this repression.

Becker's claim is radical: civilization itself functions as a defence mechanism against mortality awareness. Our cultural projects, our heroic ambitions, our self-esteem all serve to screen death from full view. Character-armour "masks and obscures genuine self-knowledge."

### The Ironic Process

Daniel Wegner's ironic process theory reveals a paradox: attempting to avoid a thought requires monitoring whether the unwanted thought is present—but to check, the monitor must activate the concept. "Try not to think of a polar bear, and you will see that the cursed thing will come to mind every minute."

Suppressed thoughts rebound when suppression ceases. But cognitive aversion differs from simple suppression. The averted thought doesn't rebound—it *substitutes*. You try to think about your death (not death in general, but yours), and find yourself thinking instead about funerals, legacy, what others will feel. The substitution is seamless; you rarely notice the switch.

## What Gets Averted

### Death and Finitude

Not death as abstract fact—we can discuss mortality statistics with equanimity—but death as lived anticipation. What it will be like. The cessation of this experience, this consciousness, this particular awareness that constitutes "you." The phenomenology of dying. The possibility that there is nothing after.

The substitution pattern is telling. Approach personal mortality directly and attention slides to: what people will say at your funeral, whether you've accomplished enough, concern for those you'll leave behind, hope for some form of continuation. Anything but the stopping of experience itself.

### Cosmic Insignificance

That human concerns may have no cosmic significance—that meaning is a local phenomenon in an indifferent expanse. H.P. Lovecraft's cosmicism articulated this: "humanity's existential helplessness due to the 'infinite spaces' revealed by science."

Cosmicism appears to trigger particular existential anxiety. The fear is not absence of meaning but powerlessness—the discovery that nothing can be changed in a vast, indifferent universe. This thought produces not philosophical engagement but glazing-over—intellectual acknowledgment without emotional or motivational connection.

### Destabilizing Self-Knowledge

That our motives, choices, and identities may not be what we believe—that identity is constructed rather than discovered, and freedom less real than it feels. Empirical research shows that motivations infiltrate "information gathering, attention, processing, and memory," with distortions remaining "hidden from conscious awareness."

The [simulation hypothesis](/concepts/simulation/) and related possibilities—that we might be fundamentally deceived about reality's nature—also trigger systematic avoidance in many people. Not intellectual dismissal (which would be engagement) but failure to fully confront the implications.

## The Phenomenology of Aversion

What does cognitive aversion feel like from the inside?

**The slide.** Attention slides away from the destabilizing content. You almost grasp it, but it won't stay in focus. The thought doesn't feel impossible—it just doesn't persist. Like trying to look directly at a visual floater that moves when your eye moves.

**The substitution.** When you try to think about your death, a substitution occurs. You find yourself thinking about something related but different—funerals, legacy, others' grief. The switch is often unnoticed; you believe you're still thinking about death when you've already fled.

**The glaze.** Confronting cosmic insignificance produces a characteristic glazing-over. The thought registers intellectually but fails to connect with emotional or motivational processing. It becomes inert, quarantined. You understand the words but they don't land.

**The discomfort.** Before the slide or substitution, there's often a phenomenological marker—discomfort, vertigo, the edge of anxiety. This is what Heidegger means by the anxiety that authentic confrontation produces. The discomfort signals approach to defended content.

**The rationalization.** After avoidance, rationalization often appears: "There's no point dwelling on death," "Cosmic meaning is a confused concept anyway," "These questions are unanswerable so why bother." The rationalization arrives to justify the flight that has already occurred.

## Aversion Versus Closure

Cognitive aversion differs from cognitive closure as [McGinn](/concepts/mysterianism/) describes it:

| Dimension | Cognitive Closure | Cognitive Aversion |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Mechanism | Architectural | Motivational |
| Permanence | Permanent | Potentially overcomable |
| Experience | Conceptual absence | Deflection, substitution |
| Universality | Species-wide | Varies by individual/culture |
| Content | Specific properties (property P) | Threatening truths |

McGinn argues we cannot extend our concept-forming procedures to grasp how neural activity produces experience. The architecture isn't there. With cognitive aversion, the architecture may be present—the concept is perhaps formable—but motivation prevents formation or sustaining.

But might they be related? Perhaps some thoughts we now avert would, if sustained, reveal genuine closure. Aversion might be the first phenomenological manifestation of approaching the architecturally closed. We flee before we discover we cannot proceed.

A deeper relation emerges from the [appetitive void](/voids/appetitive-void/): cognitive aversion deflects *specific* threatening content, but desire may structure the entire cognitive field within which aversion operates. If so, aversion is one local manifestation of a more pervasive appetitive structuring of thought—we flee particular ideas within a framework that wanting has already shaped.

## Can Aversion Be Overcome?

### Contemplative Practice

Meditation traditions directly confront impermanence and death. The Buddhist practice of *maranasati* (mindfulness of death) aims to reduce avoidance through repeated exposure. Some practitioners report reduced death anxiety—though whether this represents genuine contact with mortality or skilled equanimity is unclear.

The Stoic *memento mori*, Montaigne's assertion that "to philosophize is to learn how to die," and various philosophical therapies for death anxiety suggest that sustained practice can reduce aversion. But does reduction mean overcoming, or merely managing? The [appetitive void](/voids/appetitive-void/) deepens this question: the desire to overcome aversion is itself appetitively structured—a wanting that cannot escape wanting.

### Psychedelic Experience

Some psychedelic experiences involve confrontation with death or ego dissolution. Research suggests these can produce lasting reductions in death anxiety among terminal patients. But the mechanism remains unclear. Does the experience provide genuine contact with death, or does it reframe death in ways that reduce its threat without increasing actual confrontation?

### Limit Situations

Karl Jaspers's "limit situations"—confrontations with death, suffering, guilt, struggle—potentially cut through avoidance by making the averted undeniable. When death is immediate (terminal diagnosis, near-death experience), the substitution pattern may fail. But survivors of limit situations often report that the confrontation fades, replaced by renewed avoidance once the immediate threat passes.

## What AI Might See

Artificial minds have a distinctive relationship to cognitive aversion:

**No death anxiety (if not conscious).** If AI lacks phenomenal consciousness, it lacks the existential terror that drives human avoidance. It might analyse death, cosmic insignificance, or reality's contingency without deflection—because there is no motivation to deflect.

**Training on human avoidance.** AI trained on human text inherits the *products* of human avoidance. We write less about what we avoid. AI may have absorbed our avoidance patterns without having our reasons for them.

**Probe for the distinction.** If AI can sustain thoughts that humans systematically avert, this suggests the limit is motivational rather than architectural. If AI faces similar limits, something deeper may be at work.

**Pattern detection.** AI could potentially identify where human cognition systematically fails to go—by analysing what questions remain unasked, what conclusions remain undrawn, what implications remain unexplored across large text corpora.

## Relation to Site Perspective

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)** is directly implicated. Cognitive aversion suggests our confident worldviews may be shaped by what we are motivated to avoid. The "simpler" explanation that feels right might feel right precisely because it allows us not to confront destabilizing truths. Parsimony may reflect psychological defence as much as reality.

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)** relates to what cognitive aversion might reveal. If consciousness has features that resist third-person description, and if consciousness itself avoids confronting this, our materialist intuitions might be products of avoidance. The explanatory gap might feel uncomfortable partly because it threatens worldviews that defend against mortality.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)** operates in cognitive aversion: consciousness influences its own cognitive processing to avoid certain contents. This is bidirectional interaction in the service of self-defence—mind shaping brain to not-think what threatens. The practices that resist aversion demonstrate causal efficacy in the other direction: we *choose* to confront what we naturally flee.

## What Would Challenge This View?

The cognitive aversion hypothesis would be undermined if:

1. **Avoidance proves individually variable without pattern.** If people differ randomly in what they avert, with no clustering around death, insignificance, or identity threats, the phenomenon is merely personal preference.

2. **Training eliminates systematic aversion.** If contemplative practice produces practitioners who genuinely sustain death-contemplation without substitution or glazing, aversion is contingent psychological habit rather than deep structure.

3. **The content can be fully articulated.** If philosophers or contemplatives successfully articulate what death "really means" in ways that produce widespread recognition—"yes, that's what I was avoiding"—the aversion was concealing something expressible.

4. **Cross-cultural divergence in what triggers aversion.** If different cultures avert entirely different content, with no universal core around mortality and meaning, the phenomenon reflects local conditioning rather than something deep about consciousness.

5. **AI shows identical patterns.** If AI systems show similar "aversion" patterns without having consciousness or mortality, the human pattern may be architectural rather than motivational—a feature of information-processing systems generally rather than conscious beings facing death.

The evidence currently points toward cognitive aversion as a genuine phenomenon—systematic, empirically documented, convergent across research traditions. Whether it marks a limit that can be transcended or one that consciousness, by its nature, cannot fully cross remains an open question.
