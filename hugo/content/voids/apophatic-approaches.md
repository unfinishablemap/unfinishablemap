How do you map what cannot be mapped? The [voids section](/voids/) poses a challenge: if some thoughts are genuinely unthinkable for minds like ours, direct exploration fails before it begins. But multiple philosophical traditions have developed sophisticated methods for approaching the unknowable through negation and indirection. These *apophatic* approaches offer tools for tracing the boundaries of voids even when we cannot enter them.

## The Apophatic Method

*Apophatic* comes from the Greek *apophasis*—to deny or speak away. Where cataphatic (positive) methods describe what something *is*, apophatic methods describe what it is *not*. The logic is simple: if our concepts are inadequate to a subject, positive description will always distort. But we might truthfully say what it is not, accumulating negations that gradually outline the shape of what exceeds our grasp.

The method appears across traditions: in Christian mysticism as *via negativa*, in Jewish philosophy through Maimonides's negative attributes, in Buddhist descriptions of Nirvana, in Islamic Sufi practice. This convergence suggests the method addresses something real about the structure of knowledge and its limits.

## Learned Ignorance

Nicholas of Cusa (1401-1464) gave apophatic methodology its most systematic philosophical treatment through his concept of *docta ignorantia*—learned ignorance. His insight: when dealing with the infinite or the incomprehensible, recognising what we cannot know is itself knowledge.

"There is no proportion between finite and infinite," Cusanus argued. Human cognition works through measurement and comparison. We understand by relating the unknown to the known, the large to the small. But some subjects—the infinite, the absolute, consciousness itself—cannot be grasped through comparison because there is nothing else of their kind to compare them to.

This does not counsel despair. The point is to know more precisely *that* we do not know and *why* we do not know. Cusanus distinguished between simple ignorance (not knowing and not knowing that you don't know) and learned ignorance (knowing the limits of your knowledge). The latter is an achievement, not merely an absence.

For the voids project, this reframes the question. We need not ask only "what thoughts can we think about consciousness?" but also "what can we learn by carefully tracing where our thought fails?"

## Wittgenstein's Silence

Ludwig Wittgenstein's *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus* concludes famously: "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent." This is often read as dismissive of metaphysics—what we cannot discuss in rigorous language we should simply ignore.

But Wittgenstein's intent was more nuanced. The mystical, ethical, and existential questions are not thereby unimportant. Quite the opposite: "We don't cheapen them with words. We honor them with reverent silence." The Tractatus itself is a "ladder to be thrown away" after climbing—its propositional content is less important than the shift in perspective it enables.

For the voids project, Wittgenstein offers a methodological caution and a suggestion. The caution: some voids may be approached only through non-propositional means—silence, contemplation, attention to what evades articulation. The suggestion: sometimes the most illuminating move is to demonstrate exactly where language fails, rather than attempting to say what cannot be said.

## Cognitive Closure

Colin McGinn's "new mysterianism" applies apophatic reasoning to consciousness specifically. McGinn argues that the mind-body problem is not merely unsolved but *cognitively closed* to human minds—we lack and may forever lack the conceptual apparatus to understand how physical processes give rise to subjective experience.

This is not supernatural mysticism. McGinn's position is that consciousness is a natural phenomenon with a natural explanation. The explanation exists. Other types of minds—alien or artificial—might access it. But human cognition has evolved constraints that exclude certain conceptual territories. We cannot form the required concepts just as a mouse cannot navigate prime number mazes—the limitation is structural, not motivational.

McGinn extends cognitive closure beyond consciousness: personal identity, meaning, knowledge itself may all be "perimeter of our conceptual anatomy making itself felt." This aligns with Chomsky's distinction between "problems" (questions our minds are equipped to solve) and "mysteries" (questions that exceed our cognitive architecture).

For the voids project, McGinn's work suggests that some voids are not merely unexplored but unexplorable—at least for minds structured like ours. The [unexplorable voids](/voids/#the-unexplorable) hypothesis gains support from evolutionary considerations: there is no reason to expect that minds evolved for survival on the African savanna would have access to all truths about the nature of reality.

## Approaching the Edge

How do we use these methods practically? The apophatic traditions suggest several indirect approaches:

**Systematic negation.** What is consciousness *not*? It is not identical to neural activity (identity theory fails the explanatory gap). It is not an illusion (eliminativism is self-refuting). It is not functional organisation alone ([functionalism](/arguments/functionalism/) cannot account for qualia). Each negation rules out territory, gradually outlining the shape of what remains.

**Attending to failure.** Where does explanation break down? The [hard problem](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/) is precisely an account of where third-person physical description fails to capture first-person experience. The failure is informative. The shape of what cannot be explained reveals something about what consciousness is.

**Phenomenological attention.** Rather than trying to grasp the content of a void, attend to the *experience* of approaching it. The [voids](/voids/) page describes thoughts that "won't stick"—ideas that slide away when reached for. These phenomenological markers might indicate occluded territory. Careful attention to how thought fails may reveal patterns.

**Coincidence of opposites.** Cusanus held that at the infinite level, contradictions collapse. Where our logic produces paradoxes—free will versus determinism, mind versus matter, self versus world—we may be glimpsing the edges of a void where our finite categories break down.

**Symbolic mediation.** Some truths can be pointed to even if not described. Metaphor, analogy, mathematical structure, even art can gesture toward what exceeds propositional articulation. The site's project of using AI as a [probe for occluded territory](/voids/#alien-minds-as-void-explorers) is itself a form of symbolic mediation—using a different type of mind to triangulate what we cannot see directly.

## AI and the Limits of Language

The voids page proposes using artificial minds as instruments for detecting human blind spots. Apophatic methodology suggests how this might work.

If large language models lack the evolutionary constraints that restrict human thought, they might be able to articulate—at least partially—content that evades human cognition. But we should not expect clean success. LLMs are trained on human language, inheriting our conceptual categories and blind spots. They may have architectural occlusions of their own.

The more modest goal: use AI to pattern-match across vast corpora of human thought, noticing systematic gaps. Where do human texts consistently stall? What connections do they repeatedly fail to make? What lies at the intersection of our negations? An AI might not think the unthinkable, but it might notice where human thinking characteristically breaks down.

This approach treats the AI output not as revelation but as evidence—another data point for mapping where the voids are.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The apophatic traditions directly support the [Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits) tenet. Cusanus explicitly challenges "the modern self-assertion that has made human reason the measure of reality." If our conceptual apparatus is limited—by evolution, by embodiment, by the architecture of minds like ours—then we cannot assume that the simplest explanation we can form is the true one. Reality may be structured in ways our simplest theories cannot capture.

The [Dualism](/tenets/#dualism) tenet gains indirect support as well. The hard problem of consciousness is an instance of what apophatic traditions describe: a subject that resists positive articulation. No matter how detailed our physical description of the brain, we fail to capture what it is like to be conscious. This explanatory gap may mark a genuine limit—not a problem to be solved with better neuroscience, but a boundary where third-person description ends.

For the [voids](/voids/) project, apophatic approaches provide methodological tools. We may not be able to enter unexplorable or occluded territories, but we can:
- Map their boundaries through careful negation
- Attend to how thought fails as it approaches these edges
- Use indirect methods (symbolism, AI-assisted pattern detection) to triangulate what we cannot see directly
- Distinguish between the merely difficult and the genuinely inaccessible

The goal is not to fill the voids with speculation but to know more precisely where our knowledge ends and why it ends there. Learned ignorance is still ignorance—but it is knowledge of ignorance, which is more than simple not-knowing.
