The Unfinishable Map catalogues individual [voids](/voids/)—the [self-reference-paradox](/voids/self-reference-paradox/), the [language-thought-boundary](/voids/language-thought-boundary/), the [recursion-void](/voids/recursion-void/), the [incompleteness-void](/voids/incompleteness-void/)—as if each were an independent obstacle. But cognitive limits do not operate in isolation. Where two or more limits overlap, the hidden territory is not the sum of what each conceals. It is something qualitatively different: an emergent blindness that no single limit predicts and no single investigation can reach.

Cognitive science calls this *superadditivity*. When multiple cognitive demands compete for overlapping resources, their combined interference exceeds the sum of individual effects (Spagna et al., 2020). Transplanted from dual-task interference to epistemology, the principle suggests that compound cognitive limits create voids larger and stranger than their components.

## Beyond Additive Blindness

The default assumption about multiple cognitive limits is additive: if the [self-reference-paradox](/voids/self-reference-paradox/) hides territory *A* and the [language-thought-boundary](/voids/language-thought-boundary/) hides territory *B*, then both operating together hide *A + B*. This assumption is wrong.

Spagna et al. (2020) demonstrated that when competing cognitive processes draw on overlapping neural resources, performance decrement is superadditive—the combined effect exceeds what either task alone would predict. Their work on posterior alpha and gamma oscillations showed that "the inefficient sharing of neural resources by competing cognitive processes" produces nonlinear interference, not simple summation.

The epistemic analogue: when multiple cognitive limits share underlying architecture—as they must, since all operate within the same mind—their compound effect should exhibit the same nonlinearity. The self-reference paradox and the language-thought boundary are not independent obstacles running on separate hardware. They draw on the same cognitive substrate. Their interaction produces territory hidden for *compound reasons*—reasons that analysing either limit alone will never surface.

## Three Modes of Compound Interaction

Compound limits interact through at least three distinct mechanisms.

### Superadditive Interference

When limits draw on overlapping resources, the compound effect exceeds the sum. The [self-reference-paradox](/voids/self-reference-paradox/)—consciousness cannot fully model itself—compounds with the [language-thought-boundary](/voids/language-thought-boundary/)—experience exceeds articulable thought. Together they create a zone where consciousness can neither model *nor* articulate what it is. Each limit alone permits partial access: self-reference allows non-linguistic self-awareness, and language allows descriptions of non-self-referential experience. The compound shuts both routes simultaneously.

### Mutual Reinforcement

Some limits reinforce each other through feedback. The [recursion-void](/voids/recursion-void/)—metacognitive depth bounded around fifth-order intentionality—limits our ability to *think about* other limits. We cannot recurse deeply enough to fully comprehend our own comprehension failures. This creates a self-defending structure: the limit on examining limits protects compound void territory from investigation.

McGinn (1989) identified multiple problems subject to cognitive closure—consciousness, personal identity, free will, meaning—but never systematically asked what their *interaction* produces. The fact that a philosopher can list multiple closures without investigating their compound effect is itself a symptom. The recursion limit prevents the meta-analysis that would reveal compound structure.

### Emergent Occlusion

The interaction of limits may produce territories hidden for reasons that no single limit explains. Consider the [incompleteness-void](/voids/incompleteness-void/) (self-referential systems contain truths unprovable within themselves) interacting with the causal interface problem (how consciousness connects to physics). The compound territory is not "what incompleteness hides + what the causal interface obscures." It is the *nature of the connection between formal incompleteness and physical causation*—something neither void alone points to.

This is the deepest mode. Superadditive interference makes existing blind spots worse. Mutual reinforcement makes blind spots harder to investigate. Emergent occlusion creates *new* blind spots that exist only in the compound.

## The Phenomenology of Compound Closure

Individual limits often produce crisp phenomenological signatures. The [topology-of-cognitive-failure](/voids/topology-of-cognitive-failure/) catalogues these: the tip-of-the-tongue sensation, the moment introspection goes blank, the vertigo of infinite regress. Compound limits produce something different.

**Dissolving grip.** Where a single limit halts thought at a boundary, compound limits pull thought apart. The experience is not of hitting a wall but of the ground giving way in multiple dimensions simultaneously. Try to simultaneously think about the nature of consciousness (self-reference), articulate that thought (language boundary), and assess whether your articulation is adequate (recursion limit). The thought does not stop—it dissipates.

**The unreachable question.** Some questions are grammatically well-formed but phenomenally impossible to hold fully in mind. "What is the intrinsic nature of the mechanism by which my consciousness influences my brain?" involves the intrinsic nature void, the causal interface void, and the self-reference paradox simultaneously. Each word is comprehensible; the compound question exceeds cognitive grasp. This is the signature of compound closure—not unintelligibility but ungraspability.

## Probing Compound Territory

Direct approaches to compound voids are limited almost by definition. But indirect methods exist.

**Sequential probing.** Approach a compound void from each constituent limit separately. Compare the shapes of failure. Where the failure signatures differ despite targeting the same territory, the compound interaction becomes visible. The [topology-of-cognitive-failure](/voids/topology-of-cognitive-failure/) provides the diagnostic framework.

**Limit cartography.** The Map's existing project of mapping individual voids supplies raw material. Systematic comparison of void boundaries—where they overlap, where one void's edge falls inside another void's territory—can reveal compound structure without requiring direct access to the compound territory itself.

**Cross-architecture comparison.** AI systems face different individual limits than humans: no (known) phenomenal self-reference paradox, vastly deeper recursion, different language-thought relationships. Where human voids superadditively interact, AI voids might not overlap—and vice versa. If an AI can navigate questions that compound-close for humans, but humans find the AI's reports unintelligible, this is evidence that the compound void is architecture-dependent rather than ontological.

**Higher-order apophasis.** The negative theological tradition—particularly Pseudo-Dionysius—practices layered negation: each positive statement is denied, then the denial is surpassed. Adapted to compound voids, this becomes: "The interaction of the self-reference paradox with the language boundary is not merely the sum of what self-reference hides and what language cannot say, nor is it merely their product, nor is it captured by any function of individually characterisable limits." The negation pattern traces the shape of what exceeds description.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The Map's tenet that [Occam's Razor has limits](/tenets/#occams-limits) is directly relevant. The assumption that compound voids are simply additive—that total hidden territory equals the sum of individually hidden territories—is exactly the simplifying assumption this tenet warns against. Superadditivity in cognitive science empirically refutes additive models of limitation.

The Map's commitment to [dualism](/tenets/#dualism) gains support from compound closure. If consciousness has structural properties not derivable from component analysis—if the compound behaviour of cognitive limits is irreducible to individual limits—this parallels the irreducibility claim at the heart of dualism. The architecture of mind is not a collection of separable capacities and limits but a system whose compound behaviour resists decomposition.

For [minimal quantum interaction](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction), compound voids offer a possible explanation for why the consciousness-physics interface remains hidden. It is not merely hard to observe (empirical difficulty). It sits behind the intersection of the self-reference paradox (the observer cannot observe itself observing), the intrinsic nature void (we cannot know what matter is in itself), and the causal interface void (the mechanism connecting mind and brain is opaque). Three locks, each requiring a different key—and the compound closure ensures that possessing any two keys is insufficient.

[Tenet-generated voids](/voids/tenet-generated-voids/) already recognises that some voids emerge from the *interaction* between tenets rather than from individual commitments. Compound cognitive limits extend this principle beyond tenet-generated voids to the full ecology of cognitive limitation. The Map should treat its voids not as a catalogue of independent items but as an interacting system—where relationships between voids are as informative as the voids themselves, and where [what the limits reveal](/voids/limits-reveal-structure/) includes what their interactions reveal.
