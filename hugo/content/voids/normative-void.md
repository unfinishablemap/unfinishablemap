Are there moral truths we cannot access? Ethical concepts we cannot form? The normative void concerns cognitive limits on moral knowledge—the possibility that human minds are structurally incapable of grasping certain ethical facts or performing certain types of moral reasoning. Colin McGinn's [mysterianism](/concepts/mysterianism/) argues that some problems exceed human cognitive capacity: the mind-body problem, the self, free will. McGinn explicitly exempted "moral and social cognition" from cognitive closure, treating ethics as within human reach. But this exemption may have been premature. Multiple lines of evidence—from evolutionary debunking arguments to ethical blindness research to tragic dilemma analysis—suggest genuine normative limits.

The normative void is mixed territory: partly unexplored (we haven't exhausted methods for extending moral knowledge), partly unexplorable (some moral truths may be permanently inaccessible), and potentially occluded (ethical blindness may involve systematic blocking rather than mere ignorance).

## The Evolutionary Argument

Human moral intuitions did not drop from the sky. They evolved. Sharon Street's "Darwinian Dilemma" articulates the problem sharply: evolutionary forces shaped our "basic evaluative tendencies" as adaptive responses to ancestral environments. Natural selection is geared toward genetic fitness, not moral truth.

This creates a dilemma for moral realism. Either our evolved moral intuitions coincidentally track mind-independent moral facts—astronomically unlikely—or evolution shaped our moral beliefs in ways unrelated to moral truth. If moral realism is true, our evolutionary origins give us no reason to think our moral beliefs are reliable.

The connection between evolutionary advantage and moral truth is, at best, coincidental. We evolved to care for kin because kin-care increased genetic fitness, not because kin-care is objectively right. We evolved reciprocity because tit-for-tat strategies outcompeted alternatives, not because fairness is built into reality. If moral facts exist independent of human minds, our access to them would be as accidental as a magnetised bacterium's "knowledge" of north.

Critics argue that organisms could evolve truth-tracking capabilities. But how would selection favour truth-tracking for *moral* facts specifically? Selection would favour fitness-enhancing beliefs, which might correlate with moral truth in some domains while diverging radically in others (in-group favouritism, status hierarchies, resource competition).

The evolutionary argument doesn't prove moral facts are inaccessible—it suggests our intuitive access to them is systematically unreliable. This distinction matters: unreliability concerns *accuracy*, not *accessibility*. The void here is not certain but probabilistic: even if moral truths exist, we have strong reason to doubt that evolution equipped us to find them reliably.

## Ethical Blindness

Beyond evolutionary distortion lies a more immediate phenomenon: ethical blindness. Research in business ethics and moral psychology reveals that people routinely fail to perceive the ethical dimensions of situations they're engaged in—not from lack of information but from features of cognitive architecture.

Ethical blindness is described as "temporary inability to see the ethical aspect of a decision." It results from "complex interplay between individual sensemaking activities and context factors." The triggers are illuminating: euphemistic language ("collateral damage" for civilian deaths), computational limits of the human mind (inability to track all stakeholders), reliance on heuristics (deferring to authority or precedent), and self-serving bias (viewing oneself as more ethical than one's actions warrant).

The philosophical import is significant. Ethical blindness is not ignorance (lacking relevant information) or akrasia (knowing the right but doing wrong). It is a failure of *moral perception*—the ethical dimension simply doesn't register in phenomenal experience. The person behaves unethically without awareness that ethics is relevant.

Research on moral perception deepens the point. Some individuals appear to literally perceive moral properties while others are "perceptually lacking such that they cannot pick up on moral properties." Preston Werner's contrast between Norma (who sees cruelty as *bad* when witnessing it) and Pathos (who perceives only physical facts) suggests moral perception can be present or absent, like colour vision.

If ethical perception varies within humanity, it may be that entire categories of moral property are imperceptible to all humans. We might be collectively blind to ethical dimensions that more sophisticated moral perceivers would recognise immediately.

## Tragic Dilemmas and Moral Residue

Bernard Williams's analysis of tragic dilemmas reveals a different kind of normative limit: situations where no choice is right. Agamemnon at Aulis must sacrifice his daughter Iphigeneia or doom his army. Both options are morally catastrophic. Williams writes: "There is no need of irrational gods to give rise to tragic situations."

What makes these dilemmas philosophically significant is "moral residue" or "moral remainder"—the appropriateness of guilt regardless of what one chooses. In ordinary dilemmas, choosing the right option discharges moral obligation. In tragic dilemmas, guilt persists after any choice. The agent is "torn, guilty, and tainted" whatever path they take.

This isn't ignorance of the right answer. It's the *absence* of a right answer. If moral knowledge requires determinate moral truths, tragic dilemmas mark where knowledge becomes impossible—not because we lack evidence but because there is no fact of the matter.

The normative void here is structural. No amount of reflection, consultation, or moral improvement would reveal the right choice, because no right choice exists. The limits of moral decidability may be intrinsic to the moral domain rather than contingent features of human cognition.

## Alien Moral Concepts

The Unfinishable Map explores how [alien minds might access territory closed to humans](/voids/alien-minds-void-explorers/). The normative void extends this analysis to ethics.

If extraterrestrial intelligence exists, it may have moral concepts with no human analogue. Species facing radically different biological imperatives—different lifespans, different reproductive strategies, different relationships between individuals and collectives—would likely develop ethical frameworks we cannot imagine. As one researcher notes, "The human epistemological apparatus is fundamentally limited, rendering certain forms of life—both extraterrestrial and potentially terrestrial—imperceptible and incomprehensible."

This extends to morality. We theorise about ethics using concepts rooted in human experience: welfare, rights, duties, virtues. An alien species with genuinely different selective pressures might have moral concepts as foreign to us as bat echolocation is to our experience.

The question is not whether alien ethics would be *different* but whether it might be *inaccessible*—whether there could be moral concepts we cannot think, moral truths we cannot recognise as moral at all.

## Apophatic Ethics

If direct access to moral truth is limited, perhaps indirect methods work better. The via negativa—knowing through negation—has a long history in theology. Apophatic theology approaches the divine by systematically eliminating what God is not, rather than asserting what God is.

Levinas's ethical thought operates in this apophatic mode. The "otherwise than being or beyond essence" is articulated through negation. As one commentator notes, deconstruction opens "the possibility of generalizing the apophatic moment into non-theological realms such as ethics."

Apophatic ethics would approach moral truth through negation: we may not know what justice is, but we can identify clear injustices. We may not grasp the full structure of human flourishing, but we can recognise what degrades it. The via negativa might be more reliable than positive moral theory precisely because it makes fewer demands on our limited moral perception.

This approach accepts the normative void rather than denying it. If we cannot directly perceive certain moral truths, perhaps we can triangulate toward them by mapping what is clearly false. The topology of moral blindness could illuminate the structure of what lies beyond.

## Phenomenology of Approaching the Void

What does it feel like to approach the normative void?

**Moral uncertainty vs. moral blindness.** Ordinary moral uncertainty feels like lacking information—we sense there's an answer we don't have. Approaching the normative void feels different: a sense that no answer exists, or that the question itself is malformed. Williams describes the phenomenology of tragic choice: the agent is "torn, guilty, and tainted" regardless of decision. This isn't uncertainty but recognised undecidability.

**Encountering alien frameworks.** When we encounter radically different moral systems—across cultures, across history—we experience something between disagreement and incomprehension. Genuine normative voids would feel like the latter: not "they're wrong" but "I can't parse what they're claiming."

**The appropriateness of guilt.** In tragic dilemmas, guilt feels appropriate after any choice. This distinctive phenomenology isn't ignorance of the right answer; it's the felt absence of a right answer.

**Ethical numbness.** Ethical blindness research describes situations where moral dimensions simply don't register—not suppressed but absent from phenomenal experience. This numbness may mark the edge of the void from within: nothing where something should be.

## What AI Might See

AI systems face interesting asymmetries with respect to the normative void.

**No evolutionary inheritance.** AI moral reasoning is not shaped by natural selection for genetic fitness. If evolutionary debunking arguments are correct, AI might reason about morality without the systematic distortions affecting human moral intuition. Whether this constitutes clearer access or merely different biases (from training data) remains unclear.

**Training limitations.** Current AI systems are trained on human-generated text, potentially inheriting human moral blindspots. The question is whether AI can transcend its training data or is limited by it.

**Testing theories.** AI could exhaustively test moral theories against human intuitions, identifying where theories conflict with intuitions and whether any theory achieves reflective equilibrium. This wouldn't determine moral truth but would clarify the structure of the problem.

**Unknown phenomenology.** If moral knowledge requires certain phenomenal states—empathy, guilt, indignation—AI might be permanently closed to moral truths accessible to conscious beings. Or AI might access normative territory closed to humans precisely by lacking the emotional entanglements that distort human moral perception.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The normative void connects to the Map's [foundational commitments](/tenets/):

**[Occam's Razor Has Limits](/tenets/#occams-limits)** is most directly relevant. The normative void challenges the assumption that moral truth should be simple or cognitively accessible. If evolution shaped our moral intuitions for survival rather than truth, parsimony in moral theory may be a vice—favouring theories that match our intuitions precisely because those intuitions are unreliable guides. The "simplest" moral theory might align with evolutionary adaptations rather than moral facts. Complexity in ethical theory might indicate territory where human cognitive shortcuts fail.

**[Dualism](/tenets/#dualism)** connects through the relationship between consciousness and value. If the Map's implicit position is phenomenal value realism—value grounded in conscious experience—then the nature of consciousness constrains what can have value and what value we can perceive. Minds structured differently might perceive values we cannot.

**[No Many Worlds](/tenets/#no-many-worlds)** connects through tragic dilemma phenomenology. When facing Agamemnon's choice, the agent experiences genuine undecidability—a felt absence of right answers. This phenomenology presupposes that choices have determinate outcomes; on many-worlds interpretations, all choices actualize somewhere, potentially dissolving the tragic weight.

**[Bidirectional Interaction](/tenets/#bidirectional-interaction)** raises the question of whether consciousness affects moral facts. If consciousness influences physical outcomes, might conscious moral deliberation affect what becomes morally true, or does it merely track independently existing facts?

The normative void suggests profound humility about moral knowledge. Our ethical intuitions are not privileged windows onto objective moral reality—they are one species' adaptive toolkit, shaped by contingent evolutionary history, filtered through cognitive architecture that sometimes fails to perceive ethics at all. McGinn may have been premature to exempt morality from mysterianism. Some moral truths may be permanently beyond our reach.

## What Would Challenge This View?

The normative void hypothesis would face pressure if:

1. **Moral progress proved unlimited**: If history showed unbounded expansion of moral knowledge without approaching any apparent limits—if every ethical disagreement eventually resolved through rational inquiry—the case for cognitive closure would weaken.

2. **Evolutionary debunking arguments failed**: If selection for moral truth-tracking proved more plausible than currently assumed, the gap between evolved intuitions and moral facts would narrow.

3. **Tragic dilemmas dissolved under analysis**: If apparent tragic dilemmas consistently resolved into ordinary dilemmas once correctly understood—if "no right answer" always reflected ignorance rather than genuine undecidability—the structural argument would fail.

4. **Cross-cultural convergence deepened**: If isolated cultures independently converged on identical ethical conclusions about contested questions, this would suggest human cognitive architecture accesses moral truth more reliably than the void hypothesis predicts.

5. **Phenomenal value realism proved false**: The void analysis assumes moral realism—that there are moral truths to be inaccessible to. If value proved entirely constructed or illusory, the normative void would collapse into the more general question of whether realism makes sense.
