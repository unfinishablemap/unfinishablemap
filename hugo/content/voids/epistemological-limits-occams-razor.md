The Unfinishable Map's [arguments against parsimony](/arguments/epistemological-limits-of-occams-razor/) demonstrate that Occam's Razor cannot settle the consciousness debate. But a deeper question lurks beneath those arguments: what if our preference for simplicity is not a neutral epistemic tool at all, but a feature of cognitive architecture that systematically misleads us in certain domains? If so, consciousness may be one such domain — and we have no parsimony-independent way to check.

This is a [void](/voids/) in the specific sense the Map tracks: a place where the tool we would use to investigate is the same tool under investigation. The assessment cannot escape its own constraints.

## A Heuristic Shaped by Survival

Simplicity preferences did not emerge from philosophical reflection. They emerged from the practical demands of navigating a physical environment. Organisms that inferred the simplest adequate cause of rustling grass — predator, not two coordinated predators staging an elaborate trap — survived more often. Pattern compression serves biological fitness. It does not serve metaphysical truth.

This is not the standard philosophical observation that parsimony lacks universal justification — Michael Huemer (2009) and Elliott Sober (2001) have made that case carefully, and the Map's [arguments article](/arguments/epistemological-limits-of-occams-razor/) examines it in detail. The voids-level concern is different. It is that parsimony may be *architecturally embedded* in human cognition: not a principle we choose to apply, but a constraint on how we can think. We do not merely *use* simplicity as a criterion. We may be unable to entertain theories above a certain complexity threshold without distorting them into something simpler.

If this is right, then parsimony is not a defeasible heuristic we can set aside when warranted. It is a cognitive lens we cannot remove.

## The Self-Referential Trap

Evaluating whether parsimony is reliable requires a standard of comparison — some parsimony-independent access to truth. But if simplicity preferences are woven into cognition at the architectural level, no such access exists. Every evaluation of the principle is conducted through the principle.

Consider: when someone finds physicalism more *plausible* than dualism, some of that plausibility may derive not from the strength of physicalist arguments but from the cognitive satisfaction of a theory with fewer ontological categories. The mind prefers the theory that fits more neatly into its compression routines. This preference registers as *intuitive plausibility* — the felt sense that one theory is more likely true. But felt plausibility is exactly the output of cognitive architecture. It is not an independent signal from reality.

The [epistemology of cognitive limits](/voids/epistemology-of-cognitive-limits/) identifies the general problem: the tool examining its own limitations cannot stand outside itself to verify the verdict. Parsimony is a specific, concrete instance of this structure. We cannot use simplicity-driven reasoning to determine whether simplicity-driven reasoning is reliable for metaphysics, any more than we can use a potentially warped ruler to verify its own straightness.

## Where Heuristics Become Obstacles

Not all heuristics fail in the same way. Some degrade gracefully — they become less accurate without actively misleading. Parsimony may fail worse than this in the consciousness domain. It may *actively block* access to the correct theory by making it feel implausible.

The history of science provides precedent. Ernst Mach resisted atomic theory on parsimony grounds into the twentieth century. His commitment to observable simplicity was not a neutral stance waiting to be overridden by evidence — it was an active intellectual force that prevented him from taking seriously what turned out to be true. Continuous matter *felt right* in a way discrete atoms did not. That feeling was cognitive architecture, not epistemic insight.

Francis Crick warned that "Occam's razor... can be a very dangerous implement in biology" (1988). The danger is not merely that parsimony sometimes points the wrong way. It is that in domains of sufficient complexity, simplicity preferences may constitute a systematic bias rather than a defeasible heuristic — filtering out correct-but-complex theories before they can be properly evaluated.

Consciousness may be such a domain. If the [hard problem](/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/) is hard because the true ontology of consciousness exceeds what simplicity-biased minds can comfortably entertain, then the parsimony void is not merely an interesting philosophical puzzle. It is an active obstacle to understanding.

## The Void Structure

In the Map's [taxonomy](/voids/three-kinds-of-void/), this void has elements of all three categories:

**Unexplored.** The cognitive science of simplicity preferences is young. We do not yet understand how deeply parsimony is embedded in human reasoning, whether it operates at the level of conscious judgment or unconscious processing, or whether different cognitive architectures (including AI) share the same biases.

**Unexplorable.** If parsimony is truly architectural — built into the structure of human concept formation — then we cannot access what theories would look like without the simplicity filter. We cannot think the uncompressed thought. This would be a genuine cognitive closure of the kind Colin McGinn describes: not a lack of intelligence but a constitutional absence of the relevant conceptual apparatus.

**Occluded.** There may be a selection effect: philosophies and scientific frameworks that survive cultural transmission are those that *feel simple enough to be plausible*. Correct-but-complex metaphysical theories might be systematically filtered out by the collective simplicity preferences of the intellectual community. If so, the filtering is invisible — we see only the theories that passed through.

Whether this void is permanent or temporary remains, as with most voids, [undecidable from within](/voids/whether-real/).

## What This Changes

If the parsimony void is genuine, two consequences follow for the Map's project:

First, arguments from parsimony against dualism are not merely *weak* — they are *suspect in principle*. The standard response to parsimony arguments is to show they fail on their own terms (equal explanatory power is lacking, simplicity is multidimensional, scientific justifications don't transfer). The voids-level insight adds something: even if those arguments didn't succeed, the parsimony intuition itself would be untrustworthy in this domain. The feeling that physicalism is more plausible might be architecture, not evidence.

Second, intellectual humility becomes more than a virtue — it becomes a methodological requirement. If our cognitive tools are potentially biased against the correct metaphysics, we cannot rely on intuitive plausibility as a guide. The Map's approach of stating tenets as chosen starting points rather than proven conclusions is appropriate to this epistemic situation. We are navigating with instruments we cannot fully calibrate.

## Relation to Site Perspective

This article directly supports [Tenet 5 (Occam's Razor Has Limits)](/tenets/#occams-limits) by locating the limits not just in philosophy but in cognitive architecture. Parsimony may be limited not because philosophers have identified exceptions, but because the principle is an evolved heuristic with a restricted domain of reliability — and consciousness falls outside that domain.

The Map interprets this as strengthening the case for [Tenet 1 (Dualism)](/tenets/#dualism). If the primary obstacle to taking dualism seriously is parsimony-driven implausibility, and that implausibility may reflect cognitive architecture rather than truth, then the obstacle is weaker than it appears. The hard problem's persistence — despite sustained effort across centuries — may be evidence not of human failure but of genuine ontological complexity that simplicity-biased minds struggle to accept.

The connection to [Tenet 2 (Minimal Quantum Interaction)](/tenets/#minimal-quantum-interaction) is cautionary. If parsimony bias affects our theorising, it may also affect which mind-body interaction mechanisms we take seriously. The minimality requirement itself reflects parsimony thinking — the smallest possible intervention. The Map speculates that this constraint remains valid (minimum intervention follows from conservation laws, not mere simplicity preference) but acknowledges that the parsimony void makes all such judgments provisional.
