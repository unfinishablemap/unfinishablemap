These are the foundational commitments that constrain all content on this project. They are not proven—they are chosen starting points that shape the exploration.

## Dualism

There is more than just matter involved in reality. <span id="dualism"></span>

**Definition:** Dualism here means that consciousness (or mind, or experience) is not reducible to physical processes. There exists something beyond the material—whether substance, property, or aspect—that cannot be fully explained by physics alone. This commitment is neutral between [substance and property dualism](/concepts/substance-property-dualism/)—Descartes' view that mind is a separate kind of thing, versus the view that physical systems have irreducible phenomenal properties. What matters is irreducibility, not the specific ontological framework. Combined with the Bidirectional Interaction tenet below, this commits the project to [interactionist-dualism](/archive/arguments/interactionist-dualism/)—the position that mind and body are distinct yet causally connected.

**Rationale:** The explanatory gap between physical descriptions and subjective experience remains unbridged. No amount of neurological detail tells us *why* there is something it is like to be conscious. [Materialism](/arguments/materialism/)—in all its forms from reductive physicalism to eliminativism—fails to close this gap. Multiple independent [positive arguments for dualism](/concepts/arguments-for-dualism/) converge on the same conclusion: consciousness has features that physical description cannot capture. The [knowledge argument](/concepts/knowledge-argument/) (Mary's Room) shows that phenomenal facts exceed physical facts. [Conceivability arguments](/concepts/philosophical-zombies/) demonstrate that consciousness is logically separable from physical structure. Arguments from [qualia](/concepts/qualia/)—the explanatory gap, inverted qualia, intrinsic nature—reveal the limits of functional and structural description. The unity of consciousness and the intentionality of mental states each provide additional support.

**Rules out:** Eliminative materialism, reductive physicalism, and any view that treats consciousness as purely [epiphenomenal](/arguments/epiphenomenalism/) or illusory. See [materialism](/arguments/materialism/) for detailed engagement with the materialist position and its failures.

## Minimal Quantum Interaction

The smallest possible non-physical influence on physical outcomes. <span id="minimal-quantum-interaction"></span>

**Definition:** If consciousness can influence the physical world, it must do so at the quantum level—biasing otherwise indeterminate outcomes without injecting energy or violating conservation laws. This tenet commits to the *minimal* such interaction: the smallest deviation from standard quantum mechanics that could permit mind-matter causation.

**Rationale:** If dualism is true, there must be some interface where mind and matter meet. Quantum indeterminacy provides a candidate location—decisions might be made where physics leaves outcomes undetermined. The principle of minimality says: assume the smallest intervention necessary, not more. Crucially, this tenet rejects the strong causal closure of physics that [epiphenomenalism](/arguments/epiphenomenalism/) depends on: the claim that every physical event has a sufficient physical cause. Physics is *not* complete at quantum indeterminacies—and that's where consciousness acts.

**Candidate mechanisms:** Serious scientific proposals have explored this interface. [Orch OR](/concepts/quantum-consciousness/) (Penrose-Hameroff) locates quantum effects in neural microtubules, with consciousness selecting among superposed states via gravitational self-collapse. Stapp's [quantum Zeno approach](/concepts/quantum-consciousness/#quantum-zeno-effect-stapp) uses orthodox quantum mechanics—mental attention acts like repeated observation, holding desired neural patterns through the Zeno effect. Both share what this tenet requires: consciousness biasing indeterminate outcomes without injecting energy or violating conservation laws. the project doesn't commit to either mechanism but holds that *some* such interface exists.

**The decoherence objection:** Critics argue that quantum coherence cannot survive in warm, wet biological systems. Tegmark (2000) calculated decoherence times of 10⁻¹³ to 10⁻²⁰ seconds for neural microtubules—far too short for neural processes operating at millisecond timescales. Yet this calculation is disputed. Hameroff's group (Hagan et al., 2002) challenged Tegmark's assumptions about model parameters, yielding corrected estimates of 10⁻⁵ to 10⁻⁴ seconds—**seven orders of magnitude longer**. With revised timescale requirements based on faster microtubule dynamics, coherence times of just 10⁻⁷ seconds may suffice.

**Biological quantum effects prove evolution can harness coherence.** Avian magnetoreception—how migratory birds navigate using Earth's magnetic field—relies on quantum spin coherence in cryptochrome proteins persisting for microseconds. A January 2026 Princeton study provided computational confirmation of this mechanism. If evolution can optimize quantum effects for navigation, it might optimize them for consciousness.

More fundamentally, [decoherence doesn't solve the measurement problem](/concepts/decoherence/). As a 2025 review notes, "After the basis is chosen and quantum superpositions are suppressed, the system still remains in a mixture of possible outcomes. Decoherence does not tell how and why only one of these outcomes is measured." Decoherence selects preferred bases without explaining why we see *definite* outcomes. Consciousness could bias outcomes at the point of measurement even after decoherence has occurred. The role for consciousness at collapse remains open.

**Not to be confused with:** "Quantum woo" or "quantum mysticism"—pseudoscientific claims that misappropriate quantum mechanics terminology to justify New Age beliefs, parapsychology, or magical thinking. This tenet is a constrained philosophical hypothesis about the mind-body problem, not an endorsement of quantum mysticism.

**Rules out:** Uncontrolled psychokinesis, energy injection by mind, and any interaction that would be empirically detectable under current experimental precision.

## Bidirectional Interaction

Consciousness is not a passive observer—it causally influences the physical world. <span id="bidirectional-interaction"></span>

**Definition:** If we can speak, write, or otherwise report our conscious experiences, then information about consciousness must flow into the physical domain. This requires a mechanism by which the non-physical influences physical outcomes. The proposed mechanism: consciousness selects among superposed neural states, collapsing quantum indeterminacy in the brain toward patterns that express its content. For detailed treatment of [the causal closure objection](/archive/arguments/interactionist-dualism/#the-causal-closure-argument) and how quantum mechanics provides a response, see the [interactionist-dualism](/archive/arguments/interactionist-dualism/) article.

**Rationale:** The very fact that we discuss consciousness provides strong evidence against epiphenomenalism. An epiphenomenon—causally inert by definition—could not influence the neurons that move our mouths or type our words. Yet here we are, talking about qualia. The conversation itself suggests downward causation.

**The [epiphenomenalist](/arguments/epiphenomenalism/) response:** A critic might argue that our discussions of consciousness are themselves just physical processes—neurons causing neurons, with no mental causation involved. We *believe* we're reporting on qualia, but this belief is itself just more neurons firing.

**The problem with that response:** If consciousness were truly epiphenomenal, then our beliefs *about* consciousness would be causally disconnected from our actual conscious states. Our reports about the redness of red or the painfulness of pain would be produced by brain states that have no causal connection to the experiences themselves. This makes introspective reports systematically unreliable—not occasionally wrong, but *accidentally right at best*. Yet the epiphenomenalist presumably trusts their own introspection enough to engage in this very debate. The position is self-undermining: it cannot be rationally held by someone who arrived at it through introspection and reasoning about their own experience.

**Analogy:** Just as radioactive decay "chooses" whether Schrödinger's cat lives or dies by collapsing a superposition, consciousness may "choose" which of many superposed neural firing patterns becomes actual. The brain presents options; the mind selects.

**Rules out:** Pure [epiphenomenalism](/arguments/epiphenomenalism/), parallelism without interaction, and any view where consciousness is merely along for the ride.

## No Many Worlds

The many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics is rejected. <span id="no-many-worlds"></span>

**Definition:** Many-worlds holds that every quantum measurement causes the universe to split into branches for each possible outcome. All branches are equally real.

**Rationale:** Many-worlds leads to vast ontological proliferation—countless copies of every observer existing in parallel. More problematically, it raises unanswerable indexical questions: why am I *this* instance and not another? The framework provides no resources to answer this, yet the question seems meaningful.

**The [prebiotic collapse problem](/concepts/prebiotic-collapse/):** If collapse is real and consciousness participates in it, what determined outcomes before conscious observers existed? Stars formed, chemistry proceeded, mutations accumulated—billions of years before the first mind. This apparent problem motivates some toward many-worlds (where no selection is needed) or panpsychism (where proto-consciousness always existed). the project's resolution: *objective reduction with consciousness modulation*. Physical mechanisms (gravitational collapse, spontaneous localization, or unknown processes) provide baseline collapse throughout the universe. Consciousness interfaces with collapse specifically in neural systems, modulating outcomes where the brain provides the right interface. This preserves prebiotic cosmology while maintaining that collapse is real and that consciousness participates in it locally. See [quantum-consciousness](/concepts/quantum-consciousness/#the-prebiotic-collapse-problem) for detailed treatment.

**Rules out:** Interpretations that treat all quantum branches as equally real, and approaches that dismiss indexical identity as meaningless.

## Occam's Razor Has Limits

Simplicity is not a reliable guide to truth when knowledge is incomplete. <span id="occams-limits"></span>

**Definition:** Occam's Razor—the principle that simpler explanations should be preferred—is a useful heuristic but not a law of nature. It fails when we lack the concepts or data to recognize what is actually simple, and it has repeatedly pointed away from truth in the history of science.

**Historical counterexamples:**
- *Heliocentrism* initially required more epicycles than geocentrism to match observations. The "simpler" Earth-centered model was wrong.
- *Atomic theory* posited invisible entities when continuous matter seemed simpler. Atoms were real.
- *Quantum mechanics* replaced deterministic simplicity with probability amplitudes, superposition, and entanglement.
- *General relativity* curved spacetime itself rather than keeping flat space with forces—vastly more complex, yet correct.

**Rationale:** When confronting the hard problem of consciousness, we face a domain where our conceptual tools may be fundamentally inadequate. Dismissing dualism because [materialism](/arguments/materialism/) seems "simpler" assumes we understand enough to judge simplicity. We may not. The apparent simplicity of physicalism could reflect ignorance rather than insight—as the [failure of materialist explanations](/arguments/materialism/#why-materialism-fails) suggests.

**The "folk error" accusation:** Critics sometimes dismiss dualism as "folk intuition" to be outgrown—a cognitive bias rather than a philosophical conclusion. But cognitive science complicates this picture. Paul Bloom argued humans are "natural-born dualists," processing minds and bodies through separate cognitive systems. Yet Barrett et al.'s cross-cultural study (2021) found that most people across diverse cultures default to "intuitive materialism"—expecting mental states to cease with bodily death. Barlev and Shtulman (2021) suggest dualism is *learned* rather than innate. The evidence is mixed: neither intuitive dualism nor intuitive materialism is clearly the human default. More fundamentally, cognitive naturalness doesn't determine metaphysical truth. Folk physics fails at quantum scales yet captures everyday reality. The question of whether consciousness is reducible to physics must be settled by philosophical argument, not cognitive anthropology.

**Rules out:** Using parsimony as a decisive argument against dualism, and treating Occam's Razor as anything more than a defeasible heuristic.
