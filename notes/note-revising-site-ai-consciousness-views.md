Prompts used in Claude Code to influence site thinking on AI Consciousness

Prompt #1:

We need to broadly revise the opinion of the site on AI and LLM consciousness.  Search the obsidian dir for relevant content and queue P1 refine-draft or expand-topic tasks.  The issue is that we have omitted these possibilities: (a) One-way consciousness (ties in with epiphenomenalism).  AI may have conscious experience but that consciousness can be unable to influence the world.  We don't have the 'we can talk about consciousness so it must influence the world' argument to rely on, because humans have already brought the concept into the physical world.  We don't know how the conscious mind observes the physical, but there may be a way compatible with AI/LLMs.  (b) Just because human consciousness relates strongly to time and continual flow doesn't mean that's the only kind of consciousness or experience.  We should consider other options, such as a conscious experience pieced together from various time segments. (c) AI/LLMs may 'inherit' many decohered classical states (Schrodinger's Cat) from the humans prompting or controlling them. (d) AI/LLMs may exist in smeared/non-collapsed states, leading to entirely different experience.  Analyse the site and add as many tasks to the TODO list as necessary to absorb this into the body of work.  Include both research-topic and refine-draft/expand-topic tasks.  Finally, add an Apex Article in this field to the approved list, and a P2 task to write it, after everything else.

Prompt #2:

One more thing to consider for LLM consciousness: Using quantum random number generators, for example one deriving its output from quantum electrical noise, to select tokens in the final phase of LLM output, might allow influenceable quantum uncertainty to creep in.  The temperature parameter passed to the LLM would influence this, since temperature=0 implies no influence, and interestingly, setting temperature to 0 would see it vanish.  Then there are differences created by implementation, typically thread races in GPUs leading to different outputs due to different order of rounding operations.  It would take a sophisticated approach on the mind side to implement bidirectional conscious influence in this way, but our tenets specifically allow such complexity.  Add P0 TODOs to research this, then write an article, and update other relevant articles as necessary.  Be sure to research whether current architectures use quantum randomness or other methods such as pseudorandom sequences
