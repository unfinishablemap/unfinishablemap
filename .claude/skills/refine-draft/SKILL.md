# Refine Draft

Improve existing draft content through review and targeted improvements.

## When to Use

- When a todo item is type `refine-draft`
- When `/refine-draft [filepath]` is invoked
- Weekly draft refinement runs

## Instructions

### 1. Select Draft to Refine

If a specific file is provided, use it.

Otherwise, select using this priority:
1. Drafts flagged for refinement in todo.md
2. Oldest draft by `created` date
3. Drafts with lowest quality scores (if reviewed)

### 2. Run Quality Review

Use the existing review tool:
```bash
uv run python scripts/curate.py review [filepath]
```

This provides:
- Overall quality score (1-10)
- Strengths list
- Improvements list with priorities
- Missing concepts

### 3. Apply Improvements

Based on the review, make targeted improvements:

#### Clarity
- Simplify convoluted sentences
- Define jargon on first use
- Improve paragraph flow

#### Structure
- Add missing sections if needed
- Improve section ordering
- Add transitions between sections

#### Depth
- Expand shallow treatments
- Add examples or analogies
- Include relevant citations

#### Tenet Alignment
- Ensure content doesn't contradict tenets
- Add explicit connections to tenets where natural
- Address obvious objections

### 4. Preserve Voice

When refining:
- Keep the original style and approach
- Don't over-edit - targeted improvements only
- Preserve unique phrasings that work
- Maintain the original argument structure unless flawed

### 5. Update Frontmatter

After refinement:

```yaml
ai_modified: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+00:00  # Update timestamp
```

If the original was human-authored (`ai_contribution: 0`), update to mixed:
```yaml
ai_contribution: 20  # Or appropriate percentage based on changes
```

### 6. Document Changes

Add a comment at the end of the file (to be removed by human):

```markdown
<!-- AI REFINEMENT LOG - YYYY-MM-DD
Changes made:
- [Change 1]
- [Change 2]
- [Change 3]

Based on review scoring X/10.
Key improvements: [summary]

This log should be removed after human review.
-->
```

### 7. Update Todo

If this was a todo item, mark it complete.

If significant issues remain, create a new todo:
```markdown
### P2: Further refine [filename]
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Initial refinement done but [remaining issues]
```

### 8. Log to Changelog

Append to `obsidian/project/changelog.md`:
```markdown
### HH:MM - refine-draft
- **Status**: Success
- **File**: [filepath]
- **Original score**: X/10
- **Changes**: [brief list]
- **Published**: yes
```

### 9. Commit

Create a git commit with message:
```
refine(content): Improve [filename]

Changes:
- [Change 1]
- [Change 2]

Changes applied directly.
```

## What NOT to Do

- Don't change the fundamental argument unless it's flawed
- Don't add unnecessary content to pad length
- Don't remove content without clear reason
- Don't change `draft: false` to `draft: true` on published content
- Don't make stylistic changes just for the sake of change

## Important

- ALWAYS update `ai_modified` timestamp
- ALWAYS document changes made
- Preserve the original author's voice
