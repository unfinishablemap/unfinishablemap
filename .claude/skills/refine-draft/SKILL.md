# Refine Draft

Improve existing draft content through review and targeted improvements.

## When to Use

- When a todo item is type `refine-draft`
- When `/refine-draft [filepath]` is invoked
- Weekly draft refinement runs

## Instructions

### 1. Select Draft to Refine

If a specific file is provided, use it.

Otherwise, select using this priority:
1. Drafts flagged for refinement in todo.md
2. Oldest draft by `created` date
3. Drafts with lowest quality scores (if reviewed)

### 1b. Check for Review Context

If the task context includes a `Review file` field (e.g., from an outer review):

1. Read the referenced review file (e.g., `reviews/outer-review-2026-01-28-*.md`)
2. Find the specific issue being addressed in the task notes
3. Check the Verification Notes section to understand what was confirmed
4. Use the reviewer's specific guidance for the fix

This provides crucial context for targeted fixes rather than general refinement.

### 2. Run Quality Review

Use the existing review tool:
```bash
uv run python scripts/curate.py review [filepath]
```

This provides:
- Overall quality score (1-10)
- Strengths list
- Improvements list with priorities
- Missing concepts

### 3. Apply Improvements

Based on the review, make targeted improvements following `obsidian/project/writing-style.md`.

#### Clarity
- Simplify convoluted sentences
- Define jargon on first use
- Improve paragraph flow

#### Structure
- Verify opening summary front-loads key information
- Check for undefined forward references (use named-anchor pattern)
- Ensure "Relation to Site Perspective" section exists
- Add transitions between sections

#### Style Guide Compliance
- Important information front-loaded (truncation resilience)
- Named-anchor summaries for forward references
- Standard background minimised (focus on what's novel)
- H2/H3 headers are descriptive and aid navigation

#### Tenet Alignment
- Ensure content doesn't contradict tenets
- Add explicit connections to tenets where natural
- Address obvious objections

### 4. Check for Description

If the article lacks a `description` field in frontmatter:
- Add one: 150-160 characters
- Emphasize human+AI collaboration, iterative refinement, and pursuit of truth
- Avoid generic phrases—make it distinctive to The Unfinishable Map's approach
- Example style: "AI-assisted exploration of X—continuously refined to get closer to the truth."

### 5. Preserve Voice

When refining:
- Keep the original style and approach
- Don't over-edit - targeted improvements only
- Preserve unique phrasings that work
- Maintain the original argument structure unless flawed

### 6. Update Frontmatter

After refinement:

```yaml
ai_modified: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+00:00  # Update timestamp
```

If the original was human-authored (`ai_contribution: 0`), update to mixed:
```yaml
ai_contribution: 20  # Or appropriate percentage based on changes
```

### 7. Document Changes

Add a comment at the end of the file (to be removed by human):

```markdown
<!-- AI REFINEMENT LOG - YYYY-MM-DD
Changes made:
- [Change 1]
- [Change 2]
- [Change 3]

Based on review scoring X/10.
Key improvements: [summary]

This log should be removed after human review.
-->
```

### 8. Update Todo

If this was a todo item, mark it complete.

If significant issues remain, create a new todo:
```markdown
### P2: Further refine [filename]
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Initial refinement done but [remaining issues]
```

### 9. Log to Changelog

Append to `obsidian/workflow/changelog.md`:
```markdown
### HH:MM - refine-draft
- **Status**: Success
- **File**: [filepath]
- **Original score**: X/10
- **Changes**: [brief list]
- **Published**: yes
```

### 10. Commit

Create a git commit with message:
```
refine(content): Improve [filename]

Changes:
- [Change 1]
- [Change 2]

Changes applied directly.
```

## What NOT to Do

- Don't change the fundamental argument unless it's flawed
- Don't add unnecessary content to pad length
- Don't remove content without clear reason
- Don't change `draft: false` to `draft: true` on published content
- Don't make stylistic changes just for the sake of change

## Important

- ALWAYS update `ai_modified` timestamp
- ALWAYS document changes made
- Preserve the original author's voice
