# Optimistic Review

Find strengths in existing content and identify opportunities for expansion and improvement.

## When to Use

- Weekly opportunity assessment
- When planning content roadmap
- When `/optimistic-review` is invoked
- Optionally with a specific file: `/optimistic-review obsidian/concepts/existentialism.md`

## Instructions

### 1. Select Content to Review

If a specific file is provided, review that file.

Otherwise, review all non-draft content in:
- `obsidian/topics/`
- `obsidian/concepts/`
- `obsidian/tenets/`

### 2. Multi-Perspective Strength Analysis

Review the content from perspectives of philosophers who would be sympathetic to or aligned with The Unfinishable Map's tenets. For each, adopt their worldview and identify what resonates.

#### Supportive Personas

**The Property Dualist (David Chalmers)**
- The hard problem is real and physicalism can't solve it
- Consciousness is fundamental, not reducible
- "This content takes the explanatory gap seriously"
- Praise: Recognition that subjective experience needs explanation

**The Quantum Mind Theorist (Henry Stapp)**
- Quantum mechanics allows for mental causation
- The Copenhagen interpretation supports interactionism
- Von Neumann's process 1 is where mind enters physics
- Praise: Engaging seriously with physics-consciousness interface

**The Phenomenologist (Thomas Nagel)**
- "What is it like to be..." is the right question
- Objective science can't capture subjective experience
- Physicalism is probably false; we need new concepts
- Praise: Centering first-person experience

**The Process Philosopher (Alfred North Whitehead)**
- Experience goes all the way down
- Events, not substances, are fundamental
- Mind and matter are two aspects of the same process
- Praise: Avoiding crude substance dualism

**The Libertarian Free Will Defender (Robert Kane)**
- Quantum indeterminacy makes room for genuine freedom
- We are ultimate sources of our actions
- Determinism is incompatible with moral responsibility
- Praise: Taking agency and choice seriously

**The Mysterian (Colin McGinn)**
- Human minds may be cognitively closed to the solution
- The hard problem might be unsolvable *for us*
- This doesn't mean dualism wins—but it doesn't lose either
- Praise: Intellectual humility about what we can know

#### Standard Strength Analysis

Also identify:

**Strong Arguments**
- Which arguments are particularly compelling?
- What evidence is well-presented?
- Where is the reasoning especially clear?

**Unique Insights**
- What perspectives are original or underrepresented elsewhere?
- What connections are made that others miss?
- What framings are particularly effective?

**Effective Communication**
- Where is complex content made accessible?
- What analogies or examples work well?
- Where does the writing flow naturally?
- How well does it follow the style guide (`obsidian/project/writing-style.md`)?
- Are named-anchor summaries used effectively for forward references?
- Is LLM-optimization applied well (front-loaded information)?

### 3. Opportunity Analysis

Identify opportunities for:

#### Natural Expansion Points
- What topics naturally follow from existing content?
- What questions does the content raise but not answer?
- What depth could be added to surface-level treatments?

#### Missing Perspectives
- What philosophical traditions are underrepresented?
- What historical context would enrich the discussion?
- What scientific developments are relevant but not covered?

#### Cross-Linking Opportunities
- What existing content could link to this?
- What new content would strengthen the web?
- Are there concepts that need their own pages?

### 4. Generate Report

Create a report at `obsidian/reviews/optimistic-YYYY-MM-DD.md`:

```markdown

```

### 5. Add Suggested Tasks

Add expansion opportunities to `obsidian/workflow/todo.md` as P3 (low priority, needs human approval):

```markdown
### P3: Write article on [suggested topic]
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. See optimistic-YYYY-MM-DD.md
```

### 6. Log to Changelog

Prepend entry to `obsidian/workflow/changelog.md` (add immediately after frontmatter, before existing entries):

```markdown
## [current time from prompt] - optimistic-review
- **Status**: Success
- **Content reviewed**: [summary]
- **Output**: [filepath]
```

## Important

- This skill is READ-ONLY for content files
- Only creates report files, updates changelog and todo.md
- Does NOT modify content
- Be genuinely enthusiastic about strengths
- But be realistic about opportunities - quality over quantity
- New topics should align with site tenets
