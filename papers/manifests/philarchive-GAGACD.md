## Summary

Defends "Augmented Agency" — the symbiotic collaboration between a human conceptual architect and AI as a syntactic translator — as a legitimate method of philosophical discovery. Uses the Gageian Epistemic Model (GEM), an AI-assisted resolution of Agrippa's Trilemma, as a case study. The paper argues that the epistemic value of a philosophical discovery is invariant to the method of discovery or the discoverer's credentials, and that rejecting AI-augmented work on procedural grounds constitutes a form of systemic bias that impedes philosophical progress.

## Relevance to Our Paper

**High.** One of the most directly supportive papers for our project's framing:

1. **Provides philosophical justification** for human-directed, AI-executed philosophical inquiry — exactly the model the Map uses. The "Augmented Agency" framework maps closely to our architecture: human sets tenets and direction, AI generates and refines content.

2. **Procedural neutrality argument** — the claim that philosophical ideas should be evaluated on intellectual merit, not discoverer's credentials, directly supports our transparent ai_contribution scoring approach.

3. **Useful but handle carefully** — this is a position paper in metaphilosophy from an independent scholar, not settled consensus. We should cite it as an argument in favour of our approach, not as established authority.

## Notes

- Author is an independent scholar, not affiliated with a traditional academic institution
- The GEM case study (resolving Agrippa's Trilemma) is itself a product of the Augmented Agency method being defended
- The paper's framing of AI as "syntactic translator" is more conservative than some characterisations — it preserves human agency as the source of philosophical insight
- Complements our work more directly than any other paper in the bibliography
