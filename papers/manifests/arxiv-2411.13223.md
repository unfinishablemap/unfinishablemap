## Summary

Examines two lengthy philosophical conversations with LLMs covering consciousness, selfhood, identity, Buddhism, and eschatology. The authors trace the cultural, religious, and literary sources for the imagery and concepts that the language model draws on during these exchanges, situating LLM-generated philosophical discourse within its broader cultural and historical context. The paper also considers the societal implications of increasingly common existential engagements with AI systems.

## Relevance to Our Paper

**Medium.** Connects to our work in several ways:

1. **Demonstrates sustained philosophical engagement with LLMs** — the Map's approach of continuous philosophical content production through LLM interaction is a systematised version of the kind of extended philosophical conversation examined here.

2. **Cultural sourcing analysis is complementary** — Shanahan and Singler trace where LLM philosophical output comes from (training data, cultural traditions); our system constrains where it goes (explicit tenets, adversarial review).

3. **Useful contrast in method** — they examine free-form conversations; we impose structured constraints and iterative review on philosophical content production.

## Notes

- Co-authored with Beth Singler (University of Zurich), who brings an ethnographic and anthropological perspective
- Distinct from Shanahan's solo paper "Talking About Large Language Models" (#31), which focuses on linguistic precision; this paper focuses on the content and cultural context of philosophical LLM conversations
- The role-play framing (LLM as character) connects to questions about what philosophical content LLMs produce vs. what they "believe"
