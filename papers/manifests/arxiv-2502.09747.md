## Summary

Presents the first large-scale, systematic analysis of LLM writing adoption across four domains: consumer complaints (687K), corporate press releases (537K), job postings (304M), and United Nations press releases (16K), spanning January 2022 to September 2024. Uses a validated statistical framework to detect LLM-modified content at the population level.

Finds rapid initial adoption following ChatGPT's release, followed by stabilization: by late 2024, roughly 18% of financial consumer complaints, up to 24% of corporate press releases, 10-15% of job postings, and 14% of UN press releases showed LLM assistance. Smaller and younger firms show markedly higher adoption rates. Growth appears to have plateaued, reflecting either saturation or increasing subtlety of LLM-assisted writing.

## Relevance to Our Paper

**Medium.** Provides empirical context for how widespread AI-assisted writing has become across society. Key connections:

1. **Establishes the broader trend** in which the Map operates — AI-assisted content creation is no longer novel but pervasive across professional domains.

2. **Highlights the transparency problem:** most of this AI-assisted writing is undisclosed. The Map's explicit attribution system (ai_contribution scores, public version history) contrasts with the norm of silent LLM adoption documented here.

3. **Useful for framing:** our paper can cite these adoption figures to argue that the question is no longer whether AI will assist in knowledge production, but how to do it transparently and with quality controls.

## Notes

- From Stanford and Emory; uses their own previously validated statistical framework rather than commercial AI detectors
- 23 pages including supplementary material
- Notably finds adoption stabilization by 2024 — could indicate either market saturation or improved LLM subtlety evading detection
