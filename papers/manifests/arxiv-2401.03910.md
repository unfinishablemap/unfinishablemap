## Summary

The first part of a two-part philosophical survey of large language models, serving as both a technical primer for philosophers and an opinionated assessment of LLMs' significance for classical debates. Covers compositionality, language acquisition, semantic competence, grounding, world models, and cultural knowledge transmission. Argues that LLMs are more than mere "Blockheads" (Ned Block's thought experiment about unintelligent lookup systems), contending that while LLMs can regurgitate training data, they also flexibly blend patterns to produce genuinely novel outputs — challenging several long-held assumptions in philosophy of AI.

## Relevance to Our Paper

**Medium.** Key connections:

1. **Provides philosophical context for our work** — this comprehensive survey situates LLM capabilities within established philosophical debates about intelligence, understanding, and competence. Essential background for positioning our claim that LLMs can contribute to philosophical knowledge production.

2. **The Blockhead argument is relevant to our credibility** — Milliere and Buckner's argument that LLMs go beyond mere memorization supports our implicit assumption that AI-generated philosophical content can be substantively original rather than recombined training data.

3. **Sets up Part II's consciousness discussion** — which directly intersects with our Map's tenet on dualism and its content about consciousness and LLMs.

## Notes

- Companion paper to Part II (arxiv-2405.03207); together they form a comprehensive philosophical treatment
- Both authors are philosophers (Macquarie University, University of Houston)
- Key technical terms are highlighted and linked to a glossary in the electronic version
- Uses the "Blockhead null hypothesis" as a methodological framework — treating the deflationary interpretation as default and surveying evidence against it
- Approximately 60 pages; extensive engagement with both philosophy of mind and technical ML literature
