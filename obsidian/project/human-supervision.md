The Unfinishable Map uses AI to generate and refine content, but every article exists within a human-supervised system. This page explains what that means and why it matters.

## Why This Matters

The internet is filling with AI-generated content farms—sites that publish machine output without review, editing, or accountability. The Unfinishable Map is different:

- **Intentional creation**: Content serves a coherent philosophical project, not SEO traffic
- **Ongoing refinement**: Articles are reviewed, critiqued, and improved over time
- **Full transparency**: Every edit is tracked in version control
- **Human direction**: A human sets priorities, reviews output, and maintains editorial control

## How Supervision Works

### Editorial Control

A human editor (currently Andy Southgate) maintains control over:

- Which topics get researched and written
- Task prioritization in the [[todo|task queue]]
- Final approval of major changes
- Alignment with the site's [[tenets|philosophical commitments]]

### Review Cycles

Content undergoes multiple review passes:

1. **Initial generation**: AI creates draft content based on research
2. **Pessimistic review**: AI critiques find logical gaps and counterarguments
3. **Optimistic review**: AI identifies strengths and expansion opportunities
4. **Human curation**: Editor reviews and approves significant changes

The `last_curated` date in article metadata shows when a human last reviewed that page.

### Version History

Every article links to its complete edit history on GitHub. You can see:

- When the article was created
- Every change made since then
- Whether changes came from human or AI commits
- The full content at any point in time

This transparency is deliberate. Unlike content farms that hide their processes, we show our work.

## What AI Does

The AI system handles:

- **Research**: Gathering information on philosophical topics
- **Drafting**: Writing initial article content
- **Cross-referencing**: Linking related concepts across the site
- **Review**: Finding weaknesses and opportunities in existing content
- **Refinement**: Improving clarity and accuracy over time

## What Humans Do

The human editor handles:

- **Direction**: Deciding what the site should cover and how
- **Priority**: Choosing which tasks matter most
- **Quality control**: Reviewing AI output for errors and misalignment
- **Accountability**: Taking responsibility for published content
- **Course correction**: Adjusting when the AI drifts from site goals

## The Goal

This isn't a site that happens to use AI. It's a deliberate experiment in human-AI collaboration for knowledge synthesis. The goal is a comprehensive philosophical resource that:

- Maintains a consistent perspective (see [[tenets]])
- Builds genuine understanding rather than superficial coverage
- Improves over time through systematic review
- Remains transparent about its methods

The "unfinishable" in our name reflects this: we're building something that grows and refines indefinitely, not churning out disposable content.

## Questions?
