## Aim

The aim of this project is to form a self-consistent picture of the nature and meaning of life.  Is will not create a balanced picture saying it might be this, it might be this; it will for a single best-guess picture.  For convenience of language, this will be expressed as if fact.

## Method

It will use a combination of human input and steering, and LLM-based research.  Some content will be human-created and maintained, some will be AI-generated and maintained, most will be a combination of both.  Themes include:

* **Automation.**  The system will use Deep Research techniques and agentic tools such as Claude Code to research and review the content.

## End product

The outputs of the project will be:

*  A static web site designed for search by LLM-based tools.  This is the primary output and users are expect to query the site by referring their chat system to it (ChatGPT, Clause, Gemini, Grok) and making queries in their chat system.
* A static web site designed for human browsing and review.
* Project content and history in Git format. [https://github.com/southgateai/southgateai-main](Github)
