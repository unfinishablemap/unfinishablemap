## Overview

SouthgateAI is a philosophical content platform exploring the nature and meaning of life. The project combines human insight with AI-assisted research to build a coherent worldview expressed through structured content.

## Architecture

The platform operates in dual modes:

- **Human-browsable** (`/`) - A traditional website built with Hugo and styled with Pico CSS
- **Machine-readable** (`/api/`) - Structured JSON-LD content optimized for AI chatbots

### Data Flow

```
Obsidian vault → Python sync tools → Hugo content → Static site (Netlify)
```

## Project Structure

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `obsidian/` | Primary content source (Obsidian vault) |
| `hugo/` | Static site generator and templates |
| `tools/` | Python library modules for sync, LLM, generation |
| `scripts/` | CLI entry points |
