This ledger tracks what observations would update for or against The Unfinishable Map's framework. Several pages claim the framework is falsifiable, but the specific test hooks are scattered. This document consolidates them into a central reference, separating decisive disconfirmers from weak evidence from non-evidence.

The goal is epistemic hygiene: avoiding unfalsifiability accusations by being explicit about what could change our minds.

## The Framework's Core Claims

The [[tenets]] make five commitments:

1. **Dualism**: Consciousness is not reducible to physical processes
2. **Minimal Quantum Interaction**: Consciousness operates at quantum indeterminacies
3. **Bidirectional Interaction**: Consciousness causally influences the physical world
4. **No Many Worlds**: Collapse is real; branching interpretations are rejected
5. **Occam's Razor Has Limits**: Simplicity is not a reliable guide when knowledge is incomplete

Each claim has potential disconfirmers.

---

## 1. Dualism

**The claim**: Consciousness is irreducible to physical description. No amount of physical/functional detail captures what it's like to be conscious.

### Decisive Disconfirmers

| Observation | Why It Would Disconfirm | Status |
|-------------|------------------------|--------|
| A complete, explanatorily satisfying physical theory of qualia | Would close the explanatory gap | Not achieved |
| Demonstrating that zombie thought experiments are incoherent (not just physically impossible) | Would show consciousness is conceptually inseparable from function | Actively debated |
| Deriving qualitative character from structural/functional description | Would reduce qualia to physics | Not achieved |

**What counts as "complete and satisfying"?** A physical theory that explains not just correlation but *why* physical process P produces experience E rather than E' or no experience. Correlation is not explanation—neural correlates of consciousness exist, but correlation doesn't close the gap.

### Weak Evidence Against

| Observation | Impact | Current Status |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| Finding neural mechanisms that reliably predict specific qualia | Would strengthen correlation-implies-production intuitions | Some progress (color perception, pain) |
| Success of functionalism in other domains | Would make consciousness an anomaly | Functionalism succeeds for cognition, not phenomenology |
| Discovering physical properties that make experience seem less mysterious | Would shift burden of proof | Integrated information (IIT) claims this but is contested |

### Non-Evidence

- **Neural correlates existing**: Correlation is consistent with both production and filtering
- **Brain damage affecting consciousness**: Consistent with interface damage, not production
- **Anesthesia abolishing consciousness**: Consistent with interface disruption
- **Evolution of consciousness**: Evolution could select for interfaces, not just producers

---

## 2. Minimal Quantum Interaction

**The claim**: If consciousness influences physics, it does so at quantum indeterminacies—biasing otherwise undetermined outcomes without energy injection.

### Decisive Disconfirmers

| Observation | Why It Would Disconfirm | Status |
|-------------|------------------------|--------|
| Proving causal closure holds even at quantum collapse | Would eliminate the opening for consciousness | Not proven—the measurement problem remains open |
| Demonstrating consciousness doesn't influence quantum outcomes under controlled conditions | Would close the mechanism | Difficult to test—consciousness is the observer |
| Solving the measurement problem with no role for observers | Would eliminate logical space for consciousness | Not achieved |

### Weak Evidence Against

| Observation | Impact | Current Status |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| Sustained failure of random number generator experiments to show mind-matter effects | Would weaken confidence in mechanism | Results are mixed/unreplicable |
| Neural decoherence times proven definitively too short for any quantum consciousness mechanism | Would eliminate known mechanisms | Debated—Tegmark vs. Hameroff dispute |
| Discovery of purely physical process that determines collapse | Would close the gap | Not found |

### Weak Evidence For

| Observation | Impact | Current Status |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| Anomalies in random number generator data during mass events | Would suggest consciousness affects outcomes | Contested (Global Consciousness Project) |
| Neural quantum effects surviving longer than expected | Would strengthen mechanism plausibility | Some evidence (avian magnetoreception, microtubule coherence) |
| Correlations between attention and neural quantum states | Would support Stapp's Zeno mechanism | Preliminary research |

### Non-Evidence

- **Quantum effects existing in biology**: Proves quantum biology possible, not that consciousness uses it
- **Decoherence calculations being disputed**: The debate's existence doesn't confirm the mechanism
- **Measurement problem being unsolved**: Creates logical space but doesn't fill it

---

## 3. Bidirectional Interaction

**The claim**: Consciousness causally influences physical outcomes—it's not epiphenomenal.

### Decisive Disconfirmers

| Observation | Why It Would Disconfirm | Status |
|-------------|------------------------|--------|
| Demonstrating that all reports about consciousness are produced by physical processes with no non-physical input | Would establish epiphenomenalism empirically | Not demonstrated |
| Complete physical prediction of all behavior without consciousness variables | Would make consciousness causally idle | Not achieved—behavior prediction incomplete |
| Self-stultification argument being refuted | Would remove the main argument for mental causation | No refutation accepted |

### Weak Evidence Against

| Observation | Impact | Current Status |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| Finding purely physical explanations for attention effects | Would weaken Stapp mechanism | Mainstream neuroscience assumes physical closure |
| Libet experiments showing consciousness is consistently post-hoc | Would suggest consciousness doesn't select | Original interpretation disputed |
| No difference between conscious and unconscious processing outputs | Would suggest consciousness is causally idle | Differences exist (blindsight studies) |

### Weak Evidence For

| Observation | Impact | Current Status |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| Attention training producing brain changes (Schwartz OCD work) | Suggests mental effort has physical effects | Demonstrated |
| Conscious vs. unconscious processing producing different outcomes | Suggests consciousness matters causally | Documented |
| Self-stultification argument remaining unrefuted | Maintains pressure on epiphenomenalism | Strong |

### Non-Evidence

- **Feeling like we have causal influence**: Could be illusory
- **Physical-mental correlation**: Consistent with both directions of causation
- **Reports about consciousness existing**: Physical mechanisms could produce these regardless

---

## 4. No Many Worlds

**The claim**: Many-worlds interpretation is rejected. Collapse is real; outcomes are genuinely selected, not merely branched.

### Decisive Disconfirmers

| Observation | Why It Would Disconfirm | Status |
|-------------|------------------------|--------|
| Direct empirical evidence for branching (detecting other branches) | Would confirm MWI | Not found—probably unfindable |
| Solving probability problem in MWI convincingly | Would remove major objection | Not achieved |
| Showing indexical identity questions are meaningless | Would dissolve the objection | Actively debated |

### Weak Evidence Against

| Observation | Impact | Current Status |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| MWI being mathematically simpler than collapse interpretations | Would support Occam's argument for MWI | Mathematical simplicity claimed but disputed |
| Copenhagen problems proving insurmountable | Would favor MWI by elimination | Not established |
| Successful MWI-based predictions in novel domains | Would increase confidence | None distinctive |

### Weak Evidence For

| Observation | Impact | Current Status |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| Indexical identity mattering in other domains | Would show it's not ad hoc | Self-locating beliefs literature exists |
| Probability interpretation remaining problematic in MWI | Would maintain objection | Active research problem |
| No empirical difference between interpretations | Would make choice principled, not empirical | Current situation |

### Non-Evidence

- **Quantum interference existing**: All interpretations accommodate this
- **Superposition being real**: Both MWI and collapse accept superposition
- **Decoherence explaining apparent collapse**: Doesn't distinguish interpretations

---

## 5. Filter Theory

**The claim**: The brain filters/transmits consciousness rather than producing it. Correlations don't establish production.

### Decisive Disconfirmers

| Observation | Why It Would Disconfirm | Status |
|-------------|------------------------|--------|
| Demonstrating correlation establishes production | Would undermine filter interpretation | Philosophical, not empirical |
| Creating consciousness in novel substrates without biological history | Would suggest production not filtering | Not achieved |
| Finding the "engram"—stable memory storage in neurons | Would weaken Bergson's specific claims | Not found—retrieval mechanisms found, not storage |

### Weak Evidence Against

| Observation | Impact | Current Status |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| More brain activity → more consciousness consistently | Would fit production better than filtering | Psychedelics and NDEs show opposite pattern |
| Brain damage destroying consciousness entirely (not just limiting it) | Would suggest production | Evidence is ambiguous (covert consciousness cases) |
| No enhanced experience during brain compromise | Would weaken filter paradox | Enhancement is documented |

### Weak Evidence For

| Observation | Impact | Current Status |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| Reduced brain activity → enhanced experience (psychedelics, NDEs) | Fits filtering, embarrasses production | Documented |
| Covert consciousness in unresponsive patients | Shows consciousness persists beyond expression | ~25% of "vegetative" patients |
| Memory retrieval mechanisms found without stable storage | Fits Bergson's prediction | Engram remains elusive |

### Non-Evidence

- **Brain-consciousness correlation existing**: Both models explain this
- **Anesthesia affecting consciousness**: Both models explain this
- **Brain damage producing deficits**: Both models explain this

## 6. Retrocausality / Atemporal Selection

**The claim**: Consciousness may select outcomes atemporally, with apparent retrocausal influence (Libet resolution).

### Decisive Disconfirmers

| Observation | Why It Would Disconfirm | Status |
|-------------|------------------------|--------|
| Time-symmetric QM interpretations being ruled out | Would eliminate framework | Not ruled out |
| Showing Libet timing requires post-hoc confabulation | Would weaken retrocausal interpretation | Disputed |
| Demonstrating strict forward causation at neural level | Would conflict with atemporal selection | Not demonstrated at quantum level |

### Weak Evidence Against

| Observation | Impact | Current Status |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| Failed delayed-choice experiments | Would weaken retrocausal QM | Not conclusively failed |
| Libet results being artifact of methodology | Would remove motivation | Some critiques exist |
| Neuroscience explaining timing without retrocausation | Would make it unnecessary | Competing explanations exist |

### Weak Evidence For

| Observation | Impact | Current Status |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| Delayed-choice experiments behaving as if retrocausal | Would support framework | Standard QM result |
| Time-symmetric interpretations (TSVF) being viable | Would support conceptual framework | Actively researched |
| Libet-style experiments showing systematic patterns | Would support non-random selection | Some evidence |

## Summary Table

| Claim | Most Likely Disconfirmer | Current Assessment |
|-------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Dualism | Complete physical theory of qualia | Very unlikely soon |
| Minimal Quantum Interaction | Closing measurement problem without observers | Open research question |
| Bidirectional Interaction | Demonstrating epiphenomenalism empirically | Strongly challenged by self-stultification |
| No Many Worlds | Solving MWI probability problem | Active research problem |
| Filter Theory | Production model explaining paradoxical findings | Currently embarrassed by data |
| Retrocausality | Ruling out time-symmetric QM | Not imminent |

## What Would Update the Map's Confidence

### High-impact updates possible:

1. **Neural decoherence debate resolution**: If Tegmark is definitively right (too fast for quantum effects), mechanisms need revision
2. **Random number generator experiments**: Convincingly positive or negative results would update
3. **IIT or GWT predictions confirmed**: Would shift balance toward functionalism
4. **New measurement problem proposals**: Could close or expand logical space

### Medium-impact updates:

1. **NDE research advancing**: More evidence for or against enhanced experience during brain compromise
2. **Psychedelic neuroscience**: Better understanding of reduced activity → expanded experience
3. **Attention training effects**: More evidence of mental effort causing brain changes
4. **Libet replications**: Better understanding of timing relationships

### Low-impact but informative:

1. **AI performance advancing**: Doesn't change consciousness attributions but tests functionalist intuitions
2. **Animal consciousness research**: Tests where framework draws lines
3. **Philosophy of mind developments**: New arguments or responses

## Using This Ledger

This ledger should be updated when:
- Major empirical developments occur in consciousness science
- New philosophical arguments appear
- the Map's positions shift based on evidence
- New test hooks are identified

The purpose is accountability: being explicit about what would change our minds distinguishes principled commitment from dogmatism.
