## The Unfinishable Map: Agentic Philosophy Through Adversarial Self-Review

**Andy Southgate** — andy@unfinishablemap.org

Large language models can produce philosophical text that experts find difficult to distinguish from human output, yet existing systems generate content in single passes without sustained review or revision. This paper presents The Unfinishable Map, a continuously operating system that produces and evolves a philosophical knowledge base through tenet-constrained generation and multi-layer adversarial self-review.

**Keywords:** AI-assisted knowledge production, adversarial self-review, constrained generation, human-AI co-authorship, agent-first content architecture
