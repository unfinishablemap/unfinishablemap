## Executive Summary

Mental imagery—perceptual representation without direct sensory input—provides striking evidence for consciousness's causal efficacy. Voluntary mental imagery (deliberately visualizing) engages the lateral prefrontal cortex and can guide behavior, enhance motor performance, and reshape neural connections. The existence of aphantasia (inability to voluntarily generate mental images) vs. hyperphantasia (exceptionally vivid imagery) reveals that imagery vividness varies dramatically across individuals, yet both groups function effectively—suggesting imagery's role may be modulated rather than essential. Critically, research shows mental imagery can be conscious or unconscious, voluntary or involuntary, challenging simple identifications of imagery with consciousness. For the Map's purposes, the key finding is that *voluntary* conscious imagery—the deliberate generation and manipulation of mental representations—exemplifies consciousness directing neural activity to guide future action, supporting the Bidirectional Interaction tenet.

## Key Sources

### Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Mental Imagery
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-imagery/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Mental imagery is "perceptual representation without direct external stimulus"
  - Imagery operates across all sensory modalities (visual, auditory, tactile, etc.)
  - Critical distinction: imagery need not be conscious—even unconscious cortical representations without subjective experience count as imagery
  - Voluntary vs involuntary: flashbacks and earworms are involuntary imagery; deliberate visualization is voluntary
  - Imagery may be "partly constitutive of perception itself" (echoing Kant)
  - Aphantasia and hyperphantasia are spectrum endpoints, not discrete categories
- **Tenet alignment**: Neutral on dualism; functional definition compatible with both physicalism and dualism
- **Quote**: "Even if you experience nothing, as long as there is a triangle in your primary visual cortex, but no triangle on your retina, you have mental imagery"

- **URL**: https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(24)00034-2
- **Type**: Review article (Trends in Cognitive Sciences)
- **Key points**:
  - ~1% of population has extreme aphantasia; ~3% has hyperphantasia
  - Aphantasia associated with reduced autobiographical memory, face recognition difficulties, autistic spectrum traits
  - Hyperphantasia associated with increased synesthesia, greater openness personality trait
  - Aphantasics more likely to work in scientific/mathematical fields; hyperphantasics in creative professions
  - Neural basis: stronger prefrontal-visual connectivity in hyperphantasia vs aphantasia
  - Many aphantasics have visual dreams despite no voluntary imagery—dissociation of voluntary/involuntary
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports complexity of consciousness—imagery and awareness partially dissociable
- **Quote**: "Despite the profound contrast in subjective experience between aphantasia and hyperphantasia, the effects on everyday functioning are subtle—lack of imagery does not imply lack of imagination"

### Lennon (2023) - Aphantasia and Conscious Thought
- **URL**: https://philarchive.org/archive/LENAAC-3
- **Type**: Philosophy paper (PhilArchive)
- **Key points**:
  - Aphantasia provides counterexample to "sensory constraint" on conscious thought
  - Some aphantasics have conscious thoughts without any sensory mental imagery
  - Supports existence of non-sensory phenomenology of thought (cognitive phenomenology)
  - Aphantasics' introspective reports, neuroimaging, and task performance converge on this conclusion
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports Dualism—phenomenal consciousness includes non-sensory aspects irreducible to sensory imagery
- **Quote**: "The best explanation of aphantasics' introspective reports, neuroimaging, and task performance is that some aphantasics have conscious thoughts without sensory mental imagery"

- **Type**: Research paper (Scientific Reports)
- **Key points**:
  - Mental imagery and motor planning share neural substrates
  - Imagery activates same sensorimotor cortical networks as action execution
  - Motor simulation theory: imagined movement involves internal simulation of actual movement
  - Consciousness's role: imagining an action creates "template for action" that can guide behavior
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports Bidirectional Interaction—mental imagery (conscious) shapes motor planning (physical)
- **Quote**: "Actions are held to involve a covert stage during which they are simulated mentally...including the goal of the action, the means to reach it, and its consequences"

## Major Positions

### Mental Imagery as Conscious Phenomenon (Traditional View)
- **Proponents**: British Empiricists (Hume), early experimental psychologists (Wundt, Galton)
- **Core claim**: Mental imagery is essentially conscious—having an image means being aware of it
- **Key arguments**:
  1. Introspection reveals imagery as conscious experience
  2. The "what it's like" of imagining is paradigmatic phenomenal consciousness
  3. Historical philosophy of mind treated ideas/images as conscious by definition
- **Relation to site tenets**: Supports Dualism—imagery has irreducible phenomenal character

### Functional Definition of Imagery (Contemporary Neuroscience)
- **Proponents**: Kosslyn, Pearson, Nanay
- **Core claim**: Imagery is perceptual processing without direct sensory input—consciousness optional
- **Key arguments**:
  1. Aphantasics show visual cortex activation during imagery tasks despite no conscious experience
  2. Unconscious imagery influences behavior (priming, bias)
  3. Functional definition allows empirical study independent of subjective reports
  4. Early visual cortex represents spatial information "iconically" regardless of awareness
- **Relation to site tenets**: Potentially challenges identification of consciousness with imagery; but distinction between conscious/unconscious imagery may support distinction between phenomenal and access consciousness

### Motor Simulation Theory
- **Proponents**: Jeannerod (1994, 2001, 2006)
- **Core claim**: Mental imagery is internal simulation of action; imagination precedes and guides action
- **Key arguments**:
  1. Imagined and executed movements share neural substrates
  2. Mental practice improves motor performance (athletes, musicians, rehabilitation)
  3. "Template for action" created in imagination becomes blueprint for execution
  4. Francis Bacon: "imagination ever precedeth voluntary action"
- **Relation to site tenets**: Strong support for Bidirectional Interaction—conscious imagery (mental) causes motor outcomes (physical)

### Attention-Imagery Interface Hypothesis
- **Proponents**: Liu (2025), consistent with site's attention-as-interface framework
- **Core claim**: Attention determines which imagery becomes conscious; imagery can exist without awareness
- **Key arguments**:
  1. Left prefrontal cortex implicated in awareness of visual experiences
  2. Aphantasics have imagery-generating neural activity but lack attentional access
  3. Explains dissociation between imagery capacity and imagery awareness
- **Relation to site tenets**: Aligns with attention-as-interface hypothesis; consciousness operates through attention to access imagery

## Key Debates

### Is Mental Imagery Essentially Conscious?
- **Sides**: Traditional view (imagery = conscious) vs. Contemporary neuroscience (imagery can be unconscious)
- **Core disagreement**: Whether consciousness is definitional for imagery or merely common accompaniment
- **Current state**: Neuroscience evidence favors unconscious imagery being possible (aphantasia studies, priming effects). However, the *voluntary* component of imagery appears to require consciousness.
- **Significance for site**: Distinguishes between automatic/unconscious imagery (which occurs without phenomenal consciousness) and voluntary/conscious imagery (which involves conscious control). The latter exemplifies consciousness's causal role.

### Aphantasia: Lack of Imagery or Lack of Access?
- **Sides**:
  - Hypothesis (iii): Aphantasics have sub-personal imagery but no personal-level access
  - Hypothesis (iv): Aphantasics lack sub-personal imagery representations entirely
- **Core disagreement**: Whether aphantasia is a failure of consciousness (access) or a failure of imagery generation
- **Current state**: Evidence mixed. Some aphantasics show visual cortex activation suggesting imagery exists; others show reduced activation suggesting absence. Likely heterogeneous condition.
- **Significance for site**: If aphantasia is access failure rather than generation failure, supports distinction between phenomenal processing and conscious awareness—relevant to access/phenomenal consciousness distinction.

### Does Mental Imagery Have Causal Efficacy?
- **Sides**:
  - Causal view: Imagery guides behavior, shapes decisions, enables planning
  - Epiphenomenal view: Imagery accompanies but doesn't cause behavior; neural processes do the work
- **Core disagreement**: Whether conscious imagery adds causal power beyond underlying neural processes
- **Current state**: Strong behavioral evidence that imagery practice improves performance (sports psychology, rehabilitation). But this could be interpreted as neural practice with epiphenomenal conscious accompaniment.
- **Significance for site**: Critical for Bidirectional Interaction tenet. If voluntary imagery causally guides action, consciousness (the voluntary component) has causal efficacy. The dissociation between voluntary (conscious, LPFC-mediated) and involuntary (unconscious, LPFC-independent) imagery suggests the conscious component adds something.

### The Imagery Debate: Pictures vs. Propositions
- **Sides**: Kosslyn (iconic/pictorial representation) vs. Pylyshyn (propositional/language-like)
- **Core disagreement**: Format of mental imagery representations
- **Current state**: Contemporary neuroscience favors iconic format—early visual cortex shows retinotopic activation patterns during imagery, suggesting "representation of magnitudes by magnitudes"
- **Significance for site**: Less directly relevant to consciousness's causal role, but iconic format suggests imagery preserves perceptual structure—not just abstract description.

## Relevance to Site Tenets

### Bidirectional Interaction (Strong Support)
Mental imagery provides paradigm evidence for consciousness causally influencing the physical:
1. **Voluntary imagery is conscious**: Deliberate visualization requires LPFC engagement and phenomenal awareness
2. **Imagery guides action**: Motor simulation theory shows imagined actions become templates for executed actions
3. **Imagery changes brain structure**: Mental practice produces measurable neuroplastic changes (Schwartz's OCD, athlete training studies)
4. **Imagery influences behavior**: Even unconscious imagery biases decisions (racial bias studies, choice prediction)

The critical insight: *voluntary* imagery—generating and manipulating mental representations at will—exemplifies consciousness operating on neural systems. The dissociation from involuntary imagery (dreams, flashbacks) highlights that consciousness adds a control function beyond automatic processing.

### Dualism (Moderate Support)
1. **Cognitive phenomenology**: Aphantasics demonstrate conscious thought without sensory imagery, suggesting non-sensory phenomenal properties exist
2. **Explanatory gap**: Why does cortical activation during imagery produce vivid experience in hyperphantasics but nothing in aphantasics? Same neural activity, different phenomenology
3. **Voluntary control**: The LPFC-mediated voluntary imagery requires explanation—what decides to visualize?

### Minimal Quantum Interaction (Indirect Connection)
Mental imagery could interface with the quantum level through:
1. Attention mechanisms (imagery requires attentional control)
2. Working memory maintenance (holding images requires sustained neural activity that could involve quantum selection)
3. The "effort" of deliberate visualization parallels the phenomenology of mental effort in Stapp's framework

### No Many Worlds (Indirect)
No direct connection, though indexical questions arise: why does *this* consciousness have *this* imagery capacity (aphant vs hyperphant)?

### Occam's Razor Has Limits (Moderate Support)
The aphantasia-hyperphantasia spectrum demonstrates individual variation that simple theories miss. A "simpler" theory treating imagery uniformly fails to capture the heterogeneity.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, articles could explore:

1. **"Mental Imagery as Evidence for Consciousness's Causal Role"** — Focus on voluntary imagery as paradigm case of mind directing brain. Key argument: the voluntary/involuntary distinction maps onto conscious/unconscious; voluntary imagery requires something more than automatic processing. Supports Bidirectional Interaction tenet.

2. **"What Aphantasia Reveals About Consciousness"** — Explore what the absence of voluntary imagery teaches about the relationship between imagery and consciousness. Key insight: aphantasics function effectively, suggesting imagery is modulator not necessity; but they lack something phenomenally real. Connects to access/phenomenal consciousness distinction.

3. **"The Attention-Imagery Interface"** — How attention determines which imagery becomes conscious. Aligns with site's attention-as-interface hypothesis. Key argument: imagery exists sub-personally; attention brings it to consciousness; consciousness then directs it voluntarily.

4. **"Motor Imagery and the Reality of Mental Causation"** — Focus on motor simulation theory and sports psychology evidence. Athletes' mental practice improving performance demonstrates conscious imagery causing physical outcomes. Most directly supports Bidirectional Interaction.

## Gaps in Research

- No direct study of whether quantum effects are involved in imagery generation or control
- Limited understanding of why involuntary imagery (dreams) persists in aphantasics who lack voluntary imagery
- Unclear whether aphantasia affects actual information processing or only conscious access to it
- No resolution to whether imagery's causal effects require consciousness or merely correlate with it
- Limited cross-cultural studies of imagery variation

## Key Insight for Site

The voluntary/involuntary distinction in mental imagery provides powerful support for the Bidirectional Interaction tenet:

1. **Involuntary imagery** (dreams, flashbacks) occurs automatically—LPFC-independent, not under conscious control
2. **Voluntary imagery** (deliberate visualization) requires conscious engagement—LPFC-mediated, effortful
3. This dissociation suggests consciousness adds something: the capacity for top-down voluntary control
4. Motor simulation research shows voluntary imagery guides action: consciousness → imagery → behavior
5. If imagery could be voluntary without consciousness, we'd expect aphantasics to have voluntary imagery they're unaware of—but they report inability to voluntarily generate images, not unawareness of images they generate

The phenomenology of effortful voluntary visualization parallels the phenomenology of mental effort in attention control—both may reflect consciousness working through similar interfaces to influence neural outcomes.
