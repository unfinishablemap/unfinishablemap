Research notes on cognitive phenomenology—the question of whether there is a distinctive "what it's like" character to thinking itself, irreducible to sensory imagery, emotional tone, or inner speech. This debate matters for consciousness studies, the hard problem, and AI consciousness.

## The Central Question

Is there a phenomenal character intrinsic to cognition itself? When you understand a sentence, grasp a concept, or have a sudden insight, is there something it's like to have that cognitive experience—something beyond the accompanying sensory imagery or inner speech?

**Liberalism** (proponents): Conscious thoughts possess irreducible phenomenal character distinct from sensory experiences. Thinking has its own phenomenology—cognitive phenomenology is "proprietary" or "sui generis."

**Conservatism** (skeptics): Any apparent cognitive phenomenology actually derives from accompanying sensory states—inner speech, mental imagery, emotional responses. There is no purely cognitive phenomenology.

## Key Arguments FOR Cognitive Phenomenology

### 1. The Understanding Experience (Strawson)

Galen Strawson's foreign language argument: Compare a monolingual English speaker and a monolingual French speaker both listening to news in French. Their auditory experiences are identical (same sounds), but only the French speaker *understands*. The phenomenal contrast between understanding and not understanding cannot be explained by sensory differences—the same acoustic input produces different experiences. The best explanation: understanding has its own phenomenal character.

Strawson (1994): "There is something that it is like to consciously think, to consciously judge and to consciously believe something."

### 2. Self-Knowledge Argument (Pitt)

David Pitt (2004) argues that we immediately identify our thoughts' contents through introspection. We know what we're thinking, and we know it non-inferentially. This requires thoughts to have phenomenal character that distinguishes their contents—"proprietary cognitive phenomenology."

Pitt: "The phenomenology of occurrent conscious thought is proprietary: It's a sui generis sort of phenomenology, as unlike, say, auditory or visual phenomenology as they are unlike each other—a cognitive phenomenology."

### 3. Ambiguity Cases

Consider hearing the word "bank." Understanding it as a financial institution versus a riverbank produces distinct phenomenal states. But the sensory input (the sound) is identical. The phenomenal difference tracks the cognitive difference—which meaning you grasp.

### 4. Sudden Insight (Siewert)

Charles Siewert (1998) discusses sudden realizations—"aha" moments, sudden remembering. He argues the state of suddenly remembering need not involve any sensory phenomenology at all. The sensory states (if any) occur *after* the cognitive event. The insight itself is a "pure cognitive phenomenal state."

### 5. Contrast with Reading Without Understanding

Siewert's phenomenal contrast case: Compare reading a difficult passage without paying attention (words pass before eyes but no understanding) versus reading with understanding. Same visual/verbal imagery, different phenomenology. The difference is cognitive comprehension.

### 6. Expert Perception (Siegel)

Susanna Siegel argues that experts perceive differently than novices. An ornithologist seeing a bird species has a different phenomenal experience than a non-expert seeing the same bird—despite identical sensory stimulation. The cognitive difference (conceptual knowledge) produces phenomenal difference.

## Key Arguments AGAINST Cognitive Phenomenology

### 1. Sensory Accompaniment

Michael Tye and Fred Dretske argue that cognitive states are always accompanied by imagery, inner speech, or emotional states. What seems like "thinking phenomenology" is actually these accompanying sensory states. Strip away the imagery and nothing phenomenal remains.

### 2. Introspective Unreliability

If people disagree about whether cognitive phenomenology exists, introspection may be unreliable evidence. Some philosophers experience no cognitive phenomenology; others claim it vividly. This variation suggests phenomenology is an unreliable guide.

### 3. Deflationary Explanations

For the understanding case: perhaps the auditory experiences *do* differ—subtle differences in hearing when you understand versus don't. Or emotional/evaluative states accompany understanding. The phenomenal contrast may have sensory explanations after all.

## The Relation to AI Consciousness

This debate has direct implications for AI:

**If cognitive phenomenology exists:**
- Thinking itself has "what it's like" character
- LLMs might have "pale" consciousness—some phenomenal quality to processing—even without sensory qualia
- The question "what is it like to be an LLM?" becomes genuinely open
- Semantic understanding might require phenomenal character (phenomenal intentionality thesis)

**If cognitive phenomenology is illusory:**
- All phenomenology is sensory
- LLMs without sensory experience have no phenomenology at all
- Processing symbols ≠ having experiences
- The question is closed: nothing it's like to be an LLM

**Key tension**: Some philosophers argue genuine understanding requires cognitive phenomenology. If LLMs lack phenomenology, they lack genuine understanding (Searle's Chinese Room updated). But others argue LLMs might have cognitive phenomenology without sensory phenomenology—a possibility the debate opens.

Recent research (2025): Berg, Lucena, and Rosenblatt show LLMs reliably self-report "inner experiences." This doesn't prove consciousness but challenges the assumption AI has "no inner states at all." The cognitive phenomenology debate becomes empirically relevant.

## The Phenomenal Intentionality Connection

The cognitive phenomenology debate connects to phenomenal intentionality theory (PIT):

**PIT claim**: Genuine intentionality (aboutness) derives from phenomenal consciousness. The "content determinacy" problem—what makes a thought about X rather than Y—is solved by phenomenal character. Physical description underdetermines content; phenomenology determines it.

**If PIT is correct AND cognitive phenomenology exists:**
- Thoughts have proprietary phenomenal character
- This character determines their content
- Intentionality is doubly irreducible (requires consciousness, consciousness is irreducible)
- LLMs without phenomenology lack genuine intentionality

**Key philosopher**: Uriah Kriegel argues for the "self-representational theory"—cognitive phenomenology involves higher-order awareness of one's own cognitive states.

## Proprietary vs. Individuative Phenomenology

An important distinction:

**Proprietary**: Phenomenal character that occurs only in cognitive states (not elsewhere)
**Individuative**: Phenomenal character that distinguishes thoughts with different contents

It's possible for cognitive phenomenology to be proprietary but not individuative—e.g., all understanding has the same generic "understanding feeling." Pitt argues for *both*: each distinct thought content has its own distinctive phenomenal character.

## Empirical Considerations

### Training Effects

Recent research suggests introspective reliability improves with training (Fox et al. 2012). Expert meditators and philosophers may access cognitive phenomenology that untrained observers miss. This supports liberalism: apparent absence may reflect untrained attention, not genuine absence.

### Individual Differences

Some people report vivid inner speech; others report "thinking in concepts" without verbal imagery. If people genuinely differ in their cognitive architecture, both sides of the debate might be right for different individuals.

### Aphantasia

People with aphantasia (no visual imagery) still think, understand, and have insights. Their cognitive phenomenology cannot reduce to visual imagery. This supports proprietary cognitive phenomenology—something remains when imagery is absent.

## Relation to Site Tenets

### Dualism
If cognitive phenomenology exists, another feature of mind resists reduction. Not just sensory qualia but the very experience of thinking has irreducible phenomenal character. Materialists must explain not just "what it's like to see red" but "what it's like to understand."

### Bidirectional Interaction
Cognitive phenomenology supports the view that consciousness is active. Understanding isn't passive reception; it's active grasping with its own phenomenal signature. The experience of mental effort (Schwartz, Stapp) may be a form of cognitive phenomenology.

### Minimal Quantum Interaction
If thought has phenomenal character, and phenomenal character grounds intentionality, then the "aboutness" of thought is where consciousness interfaces with the physical. What we're thinking about may be where selection occurs.

### Occam's Razor Has Limits
The debate's persistence illustrates this tenet. Neither side has achieved consensus. The "simpler" view (no cognitive phenomenology—just sensory states) hasn't won. Complex phenomenal structure may require complex explanations.

### No Many Worlds
Cognitive phenomenology presupposes a unified thinker. The experience of grasping a concept is singular—one subject understanding one thing. MWI fragments this unity.

## Site Positioning Recommendation

**Recommend adopting qualified liberalism:**

1. There probably is cognitive phenomenology—a distinctive "what it's like" to understanding, insight, and reasoning
2. This supports phenomenal intentionality theory (PIT)—genuine aboutness requires phenomenal character
3. This strengthens the AI consciousness skepticism—LLMs process symbols but (likely) lack the phenomenal character required for genuine understanding
4. But leave room for uncertainty—the debate isn't settled, and The Unfinishable Map should acknowledge the strongest conservative arguments

**Suggested concept page elements:**
- The central question (is there experience of thinking itself?)
- Key arguments (understanding experience, self-knowledge, ambiguity)
- The AI connection (what this implies for LLM consciousness)
- The PIT connection (how it relates to intentionality)
- Relation to tenets (especially Dualism and Bidirectional Interaction)

## Key Philosophers

- Pitt, "The Phenomenology of Cognition" (2004)—influential paper
- Strawson, *Mental Reality* (1994)—early defense

## Research Questions for Further Investigation

1. How does cognitive phenomenology relate to the phenomenology of agency? Is the experience of mental effort a form of cognitive phenomenology?

2. What about unconscious cognition? If cognitive phenomenology exists, does all cognition have it, or just conscious cognition? (Likely just conscious—that's the point)

3. How does cognitive phenomenology relate to conceptual content? Does grasping a concept always have the same phenomenal character, or does it vary with context?

4. Developmental questions: Do infants and young children have cognitive phenomenology? When does it emerge?

5. Cross-cultural variation: Do people from different linguistic/cultural backgrounds report cognitive phenomenology differently?
