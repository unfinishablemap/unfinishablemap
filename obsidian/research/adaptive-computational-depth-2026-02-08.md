## Executive Summary

The idea of "adaptive computational depth" proposes that a simulated universe need not compute everything at maximum resolution simultaneously. Instead, like adaptive mesh refinement in scientific computing or level-of-detail rendering in video games, the simulation could allocate computational resources where they are needed—specifically, where conscious observers are inspecting reality closely. This concept connects three philosophical threads: (1) the simulation hypothesis and digital physics tradition from Zuse through Bostrom, (2) quantum mechanics' observer-dependent features where detailed states aren't determined until measured, and (3) the information-theoretic view of reality (Wheeler's "it from bit") where observation participates in constituting physical facts. For the Map's dualist framework, the most significant finding is that adaptive computational depth naturally positions consciousness as the driver of computational allocation—aligning with bidirectional interaction—but the standard simulation hypothesis assumes consciousness is computable, which conflicts with the Map's dualism tenet. Penrose's non-computability argument and recent Godel-based impossibility proofs create important tensions.

## Key Sources

### Bostrom, "Are You Living in a Computer Simulation?" (2003)
- **URL**: https://simulation-argument.com/simulation.pdf
- **Type**: Paper (foundational)
- **Key points**:
  - If posthuman civilizations can create ancestor simulations with conscious beings, most conscious beings would statistically be simulated
  - Crucially assumes consciousness is substrate-independent: "it would suffice for the generation of subjective experiences that the computational processes of a human brain are structurally replicated in suitably fine-grained detail"
  - Acknowledges that a low-level physics simulation on a grid with finite resolution would produce observable lattice artefacts, but argues advanced simulations would use "powerful computational shortcuts" and operate "at a much higher level of abstraction"
  - This higher-level-of-abstraction point is directly relevant to adaptive depth: the simulation need not compute quantum-level detail everywhere
- **Tenet alignment**: Conflicts with Dualism (assumes computational consciousness). Neutral on Minimal Quantum Interaction. Compatible with No Many Worlds (simulation selects single outcomes).
- **Quote**: "Even the earliest simulations of systems sufficiently complex to contain observers would make use of powerful computational shortcuts that would eliminate the opportunity to observe any such discrepancies."

### Beane, Davoudi & Savage, "Constraints on the Universe as a Numerical Simulation" (2012)
- **URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.1847
- **Type**: Paper (physics)
- **Key points**:
  - Explored observable consequences of the universe being simulated on a cubic space-time lattice
  - The most stringent bound on the inverse lattice spacing (~10^11 GeV) derives from the high-energy cutoff of the cosmic ray spectrum (the GZK cutoff)
  - If the universe were simulated on a lattice, the highest energy cosmic rays would exhibit rotational symmetry breaking reflecting the lattice structure
  - Demonstrates that fixed-resolution simulation leaves detectable artefacts—motivating the adaptive depth idea as a counter: a sophisticated simulation would vary resolution
- **Tenet alignment**: Neutral (empirical constraints, doesn't address consciousness)
- **Quote**: "The numerical simulation scenario could reveal itself in the distributions of the highest energy cosmic rays exhibiting a degree of rotational symmetry breaking that reflects the structure of the underlying lattice."

### Zuse, *Rechnender Raum* (Calculating Space) (1969)
- **URL**: https://philarchive.org/rec/ZUSRR
- **Type**: Book (foundational)
- **Key points**:
  - First work on digital physics: proposed the universe is computed by cellular automata
  - The universe is a discrete lattice of computational units following simple local rules that collectively generate complex phenomena
  - Challenged the assumption that physical laws are continuous—proposed they are discrete at bottom
  - Key precursor: if reality is discrete computation, it naturally has resolution limits, and adaptive allocation becomes a design question
- **Tenet alignment**: Conflicts with Dualism (purely computational ontology). Conflicts with Occam's Razor Has Limits (claims simple rules suffice).

### Wheeler, "It from Bit" (1989)
- **URL**: https://philpapers.org/archive/WHEIPQ.pdf
- **Type**: Paper (foundational)
- **Key points**:
  - "Every item of the physical world has at bottom an immaterial source and explanation"
  - "All things physical are information-theoretic in origin and this is a participatory universe"
  - Observer-participancy: physics gives rise to observer-participancy; observer-participancy gives rise to information; information gives rise to physics
  - The universe's properties are not fully determined until observed—reality requires observers to constitute it
  - Directly supports adaptive depth: if observation constitutes physical facts, then unobserved regions lack full determination
- **Tenet alignment**: Aligns with Bidirectional Interaction (observers participate in constituting reality). Aligns with Minimal Quantum Interaction (observer participation at quantum level). Neutral on Dualism (Wheeler didn't distinguish physical from non-physical mind).
- **Quote**: "It from bit symbolizes the idea that every item of the physical world has at bottom—at a very deep bottom, in most instances—an immaterial source and explanation."

### Wolfram, Computational Irreducibility (2002)
- **URL**: https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p737--computational-irreducibility/
- **Type**: Book/Theory
- **Key points**:
  - Certain computational processes cannot be simplified; the only way to determine their outcome is to run every step
  - For simulated universe models: even if you simulate a candidate universe for billions of steps, you cannot predict what it will do without actually running the computation
  - The passage of time is significant—computational irreducibility makes it meaningful
  - Implication for adaptive depth: a simulator might need adaptive strategies precisely because irreducibility means you cannot shortcut certain computations
  - Connection to free will: the brain's computational process may be so complex that it cannot be captured in simpler computation
- **Tenet alignment**: Partially aligns with Occam's Razor Has Limits (demonstrates limits of simplification). Partially aligns with Bidirectional Interaction (irreducibility implies consciousness cannot be predicted away).

### Irwin, Amaral & Chester, "The Self-Simulation Hypothesis" (2020)
- **URL**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7516678/
- **Type**: Paper (theoretical physics/philosophy)
- **Key points**:
  - Proposes reality is a "mental self-simulation" rather than a material simulation running on external hardware
  - Distinguishes Emergent Physical (EP) thought from Emergent Consciousness (EC) thought
  - Operates under a "Principle of Efficient Language": the panconsciousness generates maximum meaning using minimal computational resources
  - The efficient language principle is directly analogous to adaptive depth—compute only what is needed for meaning
  - Proposes the informational arrow of time arises from increasing measurement density as conscious observers evolve
- **Tenet alignment**: Partially aligns with Dualism (consciousness is fundamental, not material). Conflicts with Minimal Quantum Interaction (posits consciousness as foundational rather than intervening at quantum level). Aligns with Bidirectional Interaction (consciousness constitutes physical reality).

### Faizal et al., "Universe Cannot Be Simulated" (2025)
- **URL**: https://phys.org/news/2025-10-mathematical-proof-debunks-idea-universe.html
- **Type**: Paper (mathematics/physics)
- **Key points**:
  - Uses Godel's incompleteness theorem to argue that a fully consistent and complete model of reality requires "non-algorithmic understanding"
  - "Some truths exist that cannot be reached by following any sequence of logical operations"—Godelian truths
  - Concludes: "A fully consistent and complete description of reality cannot be achieved through computation alone"
  - If correct, this would rule out conventional simulation but not rule out the philosophical value of adaptive-depth thinking as a framework for understanding observer-dependent reality
  - Note: Godel-based arguments have been controversially applied to many domains; rigor is debated
- **Tenet alignment**: Aligns with Dualism (reality requires non-algorithmic understanding, compatible with non-physical consciousness). Aligns with Occam's Razor Has Limits (computational models are provably incomplete). Conflicts with simulation hypothesis generally.

### Penrose, Orchestrated Objective Reduction
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestrated_objective_reduction
- **Type**: Theory (physics/consciousness)
- **Key points**:
  - Consciousness originates at the quantum level in neural microtubules
  - The process is non-computable: "What they propose cannot be simulated on a computer"
  - If consciousness is non-computable, Bostrom's simulation argument fails because it assumes substrate-independent computable consciousness
  - Creates a fundamental tension: adaptive computational depth requires something doing the computing, but consciousness (which drives the adaptation) may not be computable
- **Tenet alignment**: Aligns strongly with Dualism (consciousness involves non-computational processes). Aligns with Minimal Quantum Interaction (quantum-level mechanism). Aligns with No Many Worlds (objective reduction selects single outcomes). Aligns with Bidirectional Interaction (consciousness selects quantum outcomes).

### Chalmers on Simulation and Dualism
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis
- **Type**: Commentary
- **Key points**:
  - Chalmers argues simulated observers might "find that their thoughts fail to be physically caused"
  - This means Cartesian dualism is "not necessarily as problematic a philosophical view as commonly supposed" within a simulation framework
  - A simulation could have consciousness operating outside the simulation's physics—precisely the kind of outside-the-system causation dualism posits
- **Tenet alignment**: Aligns with Dualism (simulation framework makes dualism more coherent). Aligns with Bidirectional Interaction (non-physical influence on simulated physics).

## Major Positions

### Digital Physics / Computational Universe (Zuse, Fredkin, Wolfram)
- **Proponents**: Konrad Zuse, Edward Fredkin, Stephen Wolfram
- **Core claim**: The universe literally is a computation—physical processes are computational processes running on a discrete substrate (cellular automata, hypergraph rewriting, etc.)
- **Key arguments**: Discrete structure at quantum level; computational rules generate complex emergent behavior; quantum mechanics' finite information content per volume (Bekenstein bound)
- **Relation to site tenets**: Conflicts with Dualism. If reality is purely computational, consciousness must be computational too—reducing it to physical process. However, Wolfram's computational irreducibility creates an opening: even in a computational universe, conscious processes might be irreducible and therefore functionally autonomous.

### Simulation Hypothesis (Bostrom)
- **Proponents**: Nick Bostrom, many technologists (Musk, etc.)
- **Core claim**: We are statistically likely to be living in a computer simulation created by a posthuman civilization
- **Key arguments**: Substrate independence of consciousness; exponential growth of computing power; ancestor simulation motivation
- **Relation to site tenets**: Conflicts with Dualism (assumes computable consciousness). However, the simulation framework actually makes bidirectional interaction *more* coherent—consciousness could be implemented outside the simulation's physics and influence it from the outside, analogous to a player controlling a game character. The Map's existing article on simulation already explores this diagnostic value.

### Observer-Participatory Universe (Wheeler)
- **Proponents**: John Archibald Wheeler
- **Core claim**: Observers don't merely passively detect reality—they participate in constituting it. The universe's properties are not fully determined until observed.
- **Key arguments**: Delayed-choice experiment; "it from bit"; the universe requires observers to become fully real
- **Relation to site tenets**: Strong alignment with Bidirectional Interaction. Wheeler's observers constitute physical facts, which parallels consciousness selecting quantum outcomes. Partially aligns with Dualism if "observation" requires genuine consciousness (not just physical detectors). Tension with Prebiotic Collapse: if observers constitute reality, what happened before observers existed?

### Self-Simulation Hypothesis (Irwin et al.)
- **Proponents**: Klee Irwin, Marcelo Amaral, David Chester
- **Core claim**: Reality is a mental self-simulation—consciousness simulating itself rather than a material computer simulating consciousness
- **Key arguments**: Principle of efficient language; strange-loop self-reference; panconsciousness generating meaning using minimal resources
- **Relation to site tenets**: Interesting middle ground. Agrees consciousness is fundamental (Dualism-adjacent), but merges mind and simulation into one substance (closer to idealism). The "efficient language" principle is the strongest direct formulation of adaptive computational depth in the literature.

### Anti-Simulation Arguments (Faizal 2025, computational constraints)
- **Proponents**: Mir Faizal (2025), various physicists and computer scientists
- **Core claim**: The universe cannot be a simulation due to mathematical impossibility (Godel) and physical resource constraints
- **Key arguments**: Godelian truths require non-algorithmic understanding; energy requirements for full simulation exceed plausible bounds; computational irreducibility prevents shortcuts
- **Relation to site tenets**: Aligns with Dualism (non-algorithmic understanding is compatible with non-physical consciousness). Aligns with Occam's Razor Has Limits (simple computational models provably insufficient). Note: these arguments apply to *literal* simulation but don't diminish the value of adaptive-depth thinking as a philosophical framework.

## Key Debates

### Can consciousness be simulated?
- **Sides**: Bostrom/functionalists (yes, consciousness is substrate-independent computation) vs. Penrose/dualists (no, consciousness involves non-computable or non-physical processes)
- **Core disagreement**: Whether consciousness is identical to the right computational structure or whether it requires something beyond computation
- **Current state**: Unresolved. The hard problem of consciousness remains open. Penrose's Orch OR is empirically testable but not yet confirmed or refuted.

### Is quantum measurement evidence for adaptive depth?
- **Sides**: Simulation theorists (quantum indeterminacy = lazy evaluation, a computational optimization) vs. mainstream physicists (decoherence and standard QM explain measurement without invoking simulation)
- **Core disagreement**: Whether the observer-dependence of quantum states reflects computational resource management or is intrinsic to physics
- **Current state**: The "lazy evaluation" analogy is popular but scientifically contested. Decoherence explains the appearance of collapse without requiring a simulator. However, decoherence does not solve the measurement problem (why one outcome rather than many?)—leaving the door open for observer-dependent interpretations.

### Does computational irreducibility block or support simulation?
- **Sides**: Anti-simulation (irreducibility means no shortcuts, making simulation prohibitively expensive) vs. pro-adaptive-depth (irreducibility is precisely why adaptive allocation is needed—compute in detail only where necessary)
- **Core disagreement**: Whether irreducibility is a bug or a feature for simulation models
- **Current state**: Both sides make valid points. Irreducibility means you cannot compress the computation of detailed physics, but adaptive depth does not require compression—it requires selective allocation of where to run the full computation.

### The Prebiotic Problem for Observer-Dependent Models
- **Sides**: Observer-participatory views (observation constitutes reality) vs. objectors (the universe existed and evolved for billions of years before observers)
- **Core disagreement**: How to account for cosmic history before conscious observers if reality requires observation
- **Current state**: The Map addresses this via objective reduction with consciousness modulation (baseline physical collapse mechanisms existed before consciousness, which later modulated them locally). For adaptive depth, the analogous move is: baseline low-resolution computation everywhere, with consciousness triggering higher resolution where it attends.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, an article could:

1. **Adaptive computational depth as a thought experiment for dualism** — Use the concept not as a literal claim about simulation, but as a framework for understanding how consciousness might drive which aspects of reality become determinate. The Map's existing simulation article already uses the simulation hypothesis as a "diagnostic tool for revealing hidden assumptions." Adaptive depth extends this: if reality computes adaptively, consciousness is the allocator, which mirrors bidirectional interaction. The article would need to clearly distinguish this thought-experiment use from literal simulation claims, especially given the Faizal 2025 impossibility argument. Connects strongly to existing concepts: [[measurement-problem]], [[concepts/consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns]], [[prebiotic-collapse]].

2. **The computational economy of observation** — Focus on the convergence between Wheeler's participatory universe, quantum measurement's observer-dependence, and the adaptive depth idea. The argument: reality has a "computational budget" and consciousness determines where that budget is spent. This isn't necessarily a simulation claim—it's an information-theoretic framing of why physics looks observer-dependent. Would need careful navigation of the lazy-evaluation analogy (popular but misleading if taken literally). Connects to [[quantum-consciousness]], [[bidirectional-interaction]].

3. **Why adaptive depth requires non-computable consciousness** — The strongest alignment with site tenets. Adaptive depth seems to support computational views of reality, but examining it carefully reveals the opposite: if consciousness is what drives computational allocation, and consciousness itself is non-computable (Penrose), then reality cannot be a conventional simulation even though it exhibits adaptive-depth-like features. The adaptivity is real (observer-dependent quantum mechanics), but the mechanism is non-computational consciousness acting on quantum indeterminacy. This would be the most distinctive Map contribution.

When writing the article, follow `obsidian/project/writing-style.md` for:
- Named-anchor summary technique for forward references
- Background vs. novelty decisions: skip the standard simulation hypothesis overview (well-known); focus on the adaptive depth angle and its dualist implications
- Tenet alignment requirements: connect explicitly to all five tenets
- LLM optimization: front-load the novel claim (adaptive depth implies non-computable consciousness)

## Gaps in Research

- No peer-reviewed paper specifically on "adaptive computational depth" as a unified concept—the idea exists scattered across simulation hypothesis discussions, video game analogies, and computational physics
- Limited formal treatment of the connection between adaptive mesh refinement (a well-understood computational technique) and philosophical arguments about observer-dependent reality
- The Faizal 2025 paper's rigor is debated; Godel-based arguments have a history of overreach
- No empirical evidence distinguishes adaptive-depth models from standard quantum mechanics with decoherence
- The Self-Simulation Hypothesis (Irwin et al.) is the closest to a formal treatment of efficient computational allocation in a conscious universe, but it's speculative and not widely cited
- Wheeler's participatory universe was never fully formalized; the connection to adaptive depth is suggestive but not rigorous
