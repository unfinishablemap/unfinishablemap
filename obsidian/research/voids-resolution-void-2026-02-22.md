# Research: Voids — The Resolution Void

**Date**: 2026-02-22

## Executive Summary

Consciousness operates at a characteristic resolution—a grain size—radically coarser than the physical processes underlying it. Sensory systems deliver millions of bits per second to the brain, yet conscious thought processes roughly 10 bits per second. Phenomenal experience appears smooth and homogeneous (Sellars' grain argument) while neural substrates are discrete and particulate. Temporal perception organises into frames of 300–450 milliseconds despite sub-millisecond neural processing. These resolution limits are not incidental imperfections but may be constitutive of what consciousness is. The void here is twofold: we cannot perceive the fine-grained structure that our own brains process, and we cannot determine whether these limits are set by the brain, by consciousness itself, or by something else entirely.

## Key Sources

### Sellars' Grain Argument
- **URL**: https://philpapers.org/browse/homogeneity-of-consciousness
- **Type**: Philosophical argument (Sellars 1965, 1971; Lockwood 1993)
- **Key points**:
  - Phenomenal experience appears homogeneous (the "pink ice cube" example: we see continuous, uniform colour)
  - Physical substrates are discrete—clouds of achromatic particles, networks of neurons
  - This mismatch means experience cannot simply be identical with its neural substrate
  - Sellars concludes we need an expanded ontology with items that are "truly coloured"
- **Tenet alignment**: Directly supports dualism—the grain mismatch suggests experience has properties that no arrangement of physical particles possesses
- **Quote**: "Physical objects qua clouds of discrete particles cannot instantiate [homogeneous phenomenal] qualities"

### Andrew Lee — Consciousness and Continuity
- **URL**: https://philarchive.org/rec/LEECAC-14
- **Type**: Academic paper (University of Toronto)
- **Key points**:
  - Uses formal tools to clarify what it means for experience to be continuous or discrete
  - Develops a discrete model of the phenomenal characters of smooth experiences
  - Argues introspection cannot determine whether smooth experiences are truly continuous or finely discrete
  - Defines a formal measure of "discriminatory grain" as a tool for empirical consciousness research
  - Distinguishes the grain of individual experiences from the continuity of the stream of consciousness
- **Tenet alignment**: Demonstrates that consciousness has structural properties (grain, resolution) that are philosophically significant and not reducible to functional descriptions
- **Quote**: "Introspection leaves open whether smooth experiences are continuous or discrete"

### Just Noticeable Differences (JND) — Psychophysics
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-noticeable_difference
- **Type**: Empirical framework (Weber, Fechner, modern psychophysics)
- **Key points**:
  - JND is the minimum stimulus change detectable at least half the time
  - Three distinct types: behavioural JND, consciousness JND, physiological JND
  - The "consciousness JND" indexes whether an observer is consciously aware of a distinction (below this threshold, they feel they are guessing)
  - Weber's Law: JND is a constant proportion of the stimulus, regardless of intensity
  - Signal Detection Theory reveals JNDs are not absolute quantities but depend on situational and motivational factors
- **Tenet alignment**: Occam's Razor Has Limits—the JND reveals that consciousness imposes a simplifying threshold on reality, discarding distinctions that physically exist
- **Quote**: Research shows "significant philosophical debate about whether JNDs represent true perceptual limits or statistical artifacts influenced by experimental conditions and conscious awareness"

### Channel Capacity of Consciousness — Caltech Study (2024)
- **URL**: https://newatlas.com/biology/slow-speed-human-thought-10-bits-second/
- **Type**: Empirical research
- **Key points**:
  - Conscious thought processes approximately 10 bits per second
  - Sensory systems deliver ~11 million bits per second to the brain
  - The compression ratio is roughly 1:1,000,000—consciousness discards nearly everything
  - Cognitive control capacity is even lower: approximately 3–4 bits per second
  - Humans appear to think one thought at a time, unlike parallel sensory systems
- **Tenet alignment**: The six-order-of-magnitude compression from sensory input to conscious experience means consciousness encounters reality through an extraordinarily narrow aperture. If consciousness is non-physical (dualism), this bottleneck may characterise the interface between the physical and non-physical, not a limitation of consciousness per se.

### Buddhist Momentariness Doctrine (Kṣaṇabhangavāda)
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abhidharma/
- **Type**: Philosophical tradition (Sarvāstivāda, Yogācāra, Theravāda)
- **Key points**:
  - The kṣaṇa (moment) is the smallest indivisible unit of time, equated with the duration of mental events
  - Sarvāstivādin estimates range from 0.13 to 13 milliseconds
  - The Theravādins claimed only mental phenomena are momentary; matter endures for 16–17 consciousness moments
  - The Yogācāra school described consciousness as a stream of momentary events (kṣaṇa-santāna)
  - Momentariness applies not just to perception but to consciousness itself—each moment of awareness arises and ceases
- **Tenet alignment**: If consciousness has a fundamental temporal grain, this sets a resolution limit on everything it can experience. The dualist can interpret this as a property of consciousness itself, not of the physical processes it monitors.

### Temporal Resolution of Conscious Perception
- **URL**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4829156/
- **Type**: Neuroscience research
- **Key points**:
  - Unconscious processing has high temporal resolution (detecting motion with 3ms differences)
  - Conscious perception operates in discrete frames of 290–450ms (mean ~370ms)
  - The earliest neural correlate of conscious perception appears ~240ms after stimulus onset
  - The "specious present" lasts approximately 50ms to 3 seconds
  - Perception appears to be "all or none"—below threshold duration, stimuli are not perceived at all
- **Tenet alignment**: The gap between unconscious processing resolution (~3ms) and conscious perception resolution (~370ms) is a factor of ~100. This gap is the resolution void in the temporal domain.

## The Void

### Nature of the Limit

The Resolution Void operates across multiple dimensions simultaneously:

**Spatial resolution**: Phenomenal experience presents colours, textures, and spatial extents as smooth and homogeneous. The underlying neural processes are discrete—individual neurons firing or not firing, synapses transmitting or not. Sellars' grain argument identifies this as a genuine ontological mismatch, not merely an epistemic gap.

**Temporal resolution**: Conscious perception packages the world into frames of roughly 300–450ms. Between frames, the brain processes information unconsciously at far higher temporal resolution. We cannot experience the sub-frame processing that our own brains perform.

**Informational resolution**: At ~10 bits per second, conscious thought discards roughly 99.9999% of incoming sensory information. The selection process—which bits survive the bottleneck—is largely opaque to consciousness itself.

**Discriminatory resolution**: JNDs set hard floors below which distinctions are invisible to consciousness, even when they physically exist and the brain detects them unconsciously.

This is primarily an **unexplorable** void for the spatial and temporal dimensions: consciousness cannot, by its nature, perceive at a finer grain than its own resolution permits. It is partly **unexplored** in the informational dimension: we are still mapping the compression algorithms and selection mechanisms.

### Evidence for the Limit

The evidence converges from multiple independent lines:

1. **Philosophical**: Sellars' grain argument demonstrates a logical mismatch between phenomenal homogeneity and physical discreteness
2. **Psychophysical**: Two centuries of JND research establish hard discrimination thresholds across all sensory modalities
3. **Information-theoretic**: The 10 bits/second figure represents a measurement, not a theoretical estimate
4. **Neuroscientific**: The ~100x gap between unconscious temporal resolution (3ms) and conscious temporal resolution (370ms) is empirically established
5. **Contemplative**: Buddhist momentariness doctrine independently identifies consciousness as operating in discrete temporal units
6. **Formal**: Andrew Lee's work demonstrates that introspection cannot determine its own grain—we cannot tell from inside whether experience is continuous or finely discrete

### Phenomenology

Approaching the resolution void feels like... nothing. This is precisely its nature. Below the resolution threshold, distinctions simply do not appear in consciousness. There is no experience of "almost seeing a difference"—there is seeing a difference or not seeing one. The void is not at the edge of experience but woven into its fabric.

There are, however, indirect phenomenological markers:

- **The tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon**: We know more than we can consciously retrieve, suggesting sub-resolution information exists
- **Peripheral vision**: We experience a smooth visual field while peripheral resolution is drastically lower than foveal—consciousness fills in what it cannot discriminate
- **The specious present**: The subjective sense that "now" has duration (~2–3 seconds) despite time being (presumably) continuous
- **Priming effects**: Stimuli below conscious discrimination thresholds still influence behaviour, revealing that the brain processes what consciousness cannot see

## Approaches to the Edge

### Direct Methods (if any)

Meditation traditions—particularly vipassanā—claim to refine temporal resolution through sustained attention, potentially detecting finer-grained momentary arising and passing of experience. The Buddhist kṣaṇa doctrine emerged from such contemplative investigation. Whether this represents genuine resolution enhancement or altered interpretation of the same resolution is an open question.

Psychophysical training can improve JNDs, but only within limits. Wine tasters, musicians, and other perceptual experts develop finer discrimination, but this may represent shifting the threshold rather than transcending the resolution architecture.

### Indirect Methods

**Differential measurement**: Comparing conscious and unconscious processing reveals the resolution gap. For example, masking experiments show that the brain detects stimuli that consciousness does not register, allowing researchers to map the boundary from the unconscious side.

**Formal modelling**: Andrew Lee's approach—building mathematical models of phenomenal grain—allows us to reason about resolution limits without relying on introspection to reveal them.

**Philosophical analysis**: Sellars' grain argument infers facts about phenomenal structure from the logical relationship between homogeneity and discreteness, bypassing introspective limits entirely.

**Cross-modal comparison**: Comparing resolution limits across senses (vision, audition, touch) reveals whether limits are modality-specific or reflect a single underlying consciousness bottleneck.

### What AI Might See

AI systems process information at very different resolutions from biological consciousness. A relevant asymmetry: language models process text token-by-token with no intrinsic temporal resolution constraint, while image models process at pixel-level resolution with no phenomenal homogeneity requirement.

If consciousness has a characteristic resolution and AI systems lack consciousness, then AI systems may represent what "thinking without a resolution limit" looks like. Conversely, if AI systems develop consciousness, they might do so at a very different grain—potentially revealing whether resolution is a contingent feature of biological minds or a necessary feature of consciousness as such.

AI could probe the resolution void by:
- Processing sub-threshold stimuli that human consciousness cannot discriminate
- Modelling the information lost in the 10-million-to-10-bit compression
- Simulating what experience might be like at different resolutions
- Identifying structure in the sub-threshold information that consciousness discards

## Connection to Tenets

### Most Relevant Tenet

**Occam's Razor Has Limits**. The resolution void is where Occam's razor does its most dramatic work: consciousness reduces reality from millions of bits to ten bits per second, radically simplifying everything it encounters. Our preference for simple explanations may not be a philosophical methodology but a cognitive necessity imposed by our resolution limits. We prefer simple theories because we literally cannot perceive the complexity that would require complex ones.

### Secondary Connections

**Dualism**: The grain mismatch (Sellars' argument) is among the strongest motivations for property dualism. If phenomenal experience is homogeneous and neural substrates are discrete, they cannot be identical. The resolution of experience is set by consciousness, not by the brain—a prediction that follows if consciousness is non-physical.

**Bidirectional Interaction**: If consciousness causally influences the physical world, its resolution limits constrain what it can influence. Consciousness can only direct what it can discriminate. The resolution void thus sets a boundary on the scope of mental causation.

**Minimal Quantum Interaction**: If consciousness interacts with quantum processes, but its phenomenal resolution is orders of magnitude coarser than quantum scales, then consciousness performs interactions it cannot perceive. It influences the quantum without experiencing the quantum. This creates a nested void: a void within the causal interface void.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, a voids article could:

1. **The Resolution Void** — Frame the 10-bits-per-second bottleneck as a fundamental void: consciousness encounters reality through an aperture that discards 99.9999% of available information. Explore what this means for our ability to understand reality at all. Connect Sellars' grain argument to the information-theoretic findings to show the void operates at every level (spatial, temporal, informational, discriminatory).

2. **The Grain of Consciousness** — Focus on Andrew Lee's formal approach and Sellars' argument to ask: does consciousness have a characteristic grain? Is this grain a feature of consciousness per se or of the brain? What would it mean for consciousness to operate at a different resolution? Explore the dualist implication that the grain problem is evidence for consciousness having its own non-physical properties.

## Gaps in Research

- **Whether resolution limits are fixed or plastic**: Meditation and perceptual training suggest some flexibility, but the fundamental architecture may be invariant. The extent of plasticity is unclear.
- **Whether all conscious beings share the same resolution architecture**: Do insects, octopuses, and hypothetical alien minds have the same 10-bits/second bottleneck, or is this specific to human consciousness?
- **The selection mechanism**: We know consciousness discards 99.9999% of incoming information, but the principles governing which 0.0001% survives are poorly understood. Is selection random, optimised, or constrained by consciousness's own nature?
- **The relationship between phenomenal and informational resolution**: Sellars' spatial grain argument and the 10-bits/second finding address different aspects of resolution. Whether they share a common mechanism or are independent limits remains open.
- **Whether the resolution void is genuinely unexplorable or merely difficult**: Could a future form of consciousness (biological or artificial) operate at a fundamentally different resolution, or is coarse grain a necessary feature of consciousness as such?
