## Executive Summary

The categorial void concerns a deeper level of cognitive constraint than individual concepts or propositions: the possibility that our most fundamental categories of thought—subject/object, cause/effect, substance/property, space/time, one/many—are not features of reality but contingent features of our cognitive architecture. If reality is organized along dimensions that our categories cannot parse, entire domains of structure would be not merely unknown but structurally invisible. We would lack not just the answers but the capacity to formulate the questions. This void operates beneath conceptual impossibility (which concerns contradictory content within our categories) and conceptual acquisition limits (which concerns new primitives within our categorical framework). The categorial void asks whether the framework itself is a cage.

## Key Sources

### Kant — Critique of Pure Reason (1781)
- **Type**: Foundational philosophical text
- **Key points**:
  - Identifies twelve fundamental categories (quantity, quality, relation, modality) as conditions for any possible experience
  - Categories are not derived from experience but are prerequisites for having experience at all
  - We can know phenomena (things as they appear through our categories) but never noumena (things in themselves)
  - Rae Langton interprets this as "epistemic humility"—inevitable constraints on what we can know
- **Tenet alignment**: Directly supports "Occam's Razor Has Limits"—if our categories are filters, reality may be irreducibly more complex than any theory expressible within those categories
- **Quote**: "The categories do not have their origin in sensibility; while they 'seem to allow of an application extending beyond all objects of the senses', as a matter of fact they are nothing but forms of thought"

### Colin McGinn — Cognitive Closure and New Mysterianism
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_closure_(philosophy)
- **Type**: Contemporary philosophical framework
- **Key points**:
  - Defines cognitive closure formally: "A type of mind M is cognitively closed with respect to a property P if and only if the concept-forming procedures at M's disposal cannot extend to a grasp of P"
  - The problem is not insoluble in principle—just to minds like ours
  - Other minds (alien or artificial) might have the conceptual apparatus humans lack
  - Our inability to solve the mind-body problem may not reflect the problem's difficulty but our cognitive architecture's limitations
- **Tenet alignment**: Strongly supports dualism—if consciousness is non-physical, the categories evolved for navigating physical reality may systematically fail to capture its nature
- **Quote**: "It is like trying to see ultraviolet light: a feature of reality that is simply beyond our perceptual equipment"

### Wilfrid Sellars — The Myth of the Given (1956)
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sellars/
- **Type**: Epistemological framework
- **Key points**:
  - Argues that all perception is already theory-laden—there is no "given" that is pre-categorical
  - "There is nothing to a conceptual apparatus that isn't determined by its rules"
  - We cannot choose our categories to conform with antecedently apprehended reality, because apprehension already presupposes the categories
  - This creates a bootstrapping problem: categories cannot be verified against category-free reality
  - The "categorical given"—his most fundamental form of the myth—is the assumption that if we are aware of something with categorial status C, we are aware of it *as having* status C
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports "Occam's Razor Has Limits"—if all observation is already categorical, we cannot use observation to evaluate whether our categories match reality

### Donald Davidson — "On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme" (1974)
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/davidson/
- **Type**: Philosophical critique
- **Key points**:
  - Argues against scheme-content dualism: the idea that we can distinguish a conceptual component from an empirical component in knowledge
  - Claims the very idea of alternative conceptual schemes is incoherent—if we could identify an alternative scheme, we could already translate it
  - If Davidson is right, the categorial void may be unfalsifiable (we can never establish that alternatives exist)
  - But critics note that Davidson's argument may prove too much: it might make genuine cognitive limitations invisible by defining them away
- **Tenet alignment**: Creates tension—Davidson's argument could be seen as an instance of Occam's Razor suppressing genuine complexity

### P. F. Strawson — Descriptive Metaphysics (1959)
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/strawson/
- **Type**: Metaphysical framework
- **Key points**:
  - Claims there is "a massive central core of human thinking which has no history"—categories that never change
  - Material bodies are ontologically prior because they sustain the spatio-temporal framework
  - Self-conscious experience presupposes a distinction between experience and its mind-independent objects
  - Identifies three criteria for basic categories: Generality, Irreducibility, No-Contingency
  - But Strawson describes *our* conceptual scheme's structure—the void question is whether that scheme exhausts the possibilities
- **Tenet alignment**: If Strawson is right about the fixity of our categories, the categorial void is deep—these aren't changing, ever, for human minds

### Thomas Nagel — The View from Nowhere (1986)
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness/
- **Type**: Philosophical analysis
- **Key points**:
  - Argues for inherent limitations in achieving fully objective understanding
  - The subjective perspective cannot be entirely subsumed by an objective one
  - Concepts of mental states require direct acquaintance—species-specific constraints on concept possession
  - Our most objective understanding of the world is likely to remain incomplete
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports dualism and bidirectional interaction—consciousness resists complete objectification precisely because it is not just another object

### Martin Heidegger — Being and Time (1927)
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heidegger/
- **Type**: Ontological analysis
- **Key points**:
  - The "clearing" (Lichtung) is the space where things appear in their being—but appearances are always pre-interpreted
  - We inhabit a "pre-understanding" that structures all encounter with beings before reflective thought begins
  - Western metaphysics has undergone "forgetfulness of being"—our categories have ossified and hidden their own contingency
  - Heidegger distinguishes "categories" (for non-Dasein entities) from "existentials" (for Dasein), suggesting our categorical framework may be fundamentally misapplied to consciousness
- **Tenet alignment**: Heidegger's insight that categories appropriate for objects may be inappropriate for consciousness directly supports dualism's claim that consciousness requires different explanatory frameworks

### Wittgenstein — Forms of Life
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/
- **Type**: Philosophical framework
- **Key points**:
  - "The limits of my language mean the limits of my world"
  - Conceptual frameworks are given by our form of life—and there is no reason to suppose only one form of life is possible
  - Wittgenstein imagined an indefinite multiplicity of language-games, potentially incommensurable with each other
  - Some scholars argue translation between forms of life may be impossible in certain circumstances
- **Tenet alignment**: If forms of life are truly plural and incommensurable, our categorical framework may be one among many—each revealing and concealing different aspects of reality

### Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis (Linguistic Relativity)
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity
- **Type**: Linguistic/cognitive theory
- **Key points**:
  - Strong version (linguistic determinism): language determines thought; linguistic categories limit cognitive categories
  - Graham argues that concepts like physical object, causation, and quantity are "parochial shadows cast by Indo-European languages" with no counterparts in many non-Indo-European languages
  - The strong form is widely rejected by professional linguists, but the weak form (language influences thought) has empirical support
  - Even weak relativism raises the question: if language influences categorization, could *all* human languages share categorical blind spots?
- **Tenet alignment**: If even weak linguistic relativity holds, our categorical vocabulary may systematically exclude certain structures of reality—supporting the view that Occam's Razor has limits

### Frontiers in Psychology — "Primary Cognitive Categories Are Determined by Their Invariances" (2020)
- **URL**: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.584017/full
- **Type**: Empirical/theoretical cognitive science
- **Key points**:
  - Space, object, and action are fundamental cognitive categories determined by invariance structures in perception
  - These represent a neo-Kantian program of describing the forms of perception
  - Categories are determined not by convention but by the mathematical structure of perceptual invariances
  - This suggests categories are more deeply embedded than language—they are built into the mathematics of our sensory processing
- **Tenet alignment**: If categories are determined by perceptual invariances, they are features of our embodiment—and disembodied or differently-embodied minds might have radically different categories

## The Void

### Nature of the Limit

The categorial void is mixed: partly unexplorable (if our categories are hardwired, no effort can overcome them) and partly occluded (if, as the simulation hypothesis or the bidirectional interaction tenet suggests, certain categorical structures are actively hidden from us).

What makes this void distinctive is its *depth*. Most cognitive limits operate within our categorical framework—we cannot conceive a round square, we cannot acquire certain concepts, we cannot access other minds' experience. The categorial void operates on the framework itself. It is the possibility that the subject-object distinction, the cause-effect relation, the substance-property structure, the space-time manifold, and the one-many relation are not features of reality but features of the lens through which we perceive reality.

This is deeper than McGinn's cognitive closure, which concerns specific properties or theories. The categorial void concerns the *space of possible theories*—if our categories constrain which theories can even be formulated, then there may be true descriptions of reality that are not merely undiscovered but inexpressible within any framework we can construct.

### Evidence for the Limit

1. **The Kantian argument**: If categories are preconditions for experience, they cannot be empirically evaluated—we have no category-free experience to compare against.

2. **The Sellarsian bootstrapping problem**: We cannot step outside our categorical framework to evaluate it, because the very act of evaluation employs the framework.

3. **Cross-cultural convergence**: Strawson's claim that core categories are universal and ahistorical suggests they are not learned (and therefore may not be revisable). The research on perceptual invariances confirms this—space, object, and action categories appear cross-culturally stable.

4. **The hard problem as evidence**: The persistent failure to explain consciousness in physical terms may be evidence that our categories (physical substance, causal mechanism, spatial location) are inadequate for the task—not that consciousness is mysterious but that our categories are blind to whatever it is.

5. **Mathematical structures beyond intuition**: Mathematics routinely discovers structures (infinite-dimensional spaces, non-commutative geometries, category theory itself) that cannot be visualized or intuitively grasped. These exist within formal systems but resist categorical understanding. This hints at a broader pattern: formal manipulation can reach places intuition (which relies on categories) cannot.

### Phenomenology

What does it feel like to approach the categorial void? Unlike the sharp "bounce" of conceptual impossibility (trying to conceive a round square), the categorial void manifests as:

- **Intellectual vertigo**: The disorienting sense that one's most basic assumptions might be mere features of one's cognitive architecture, with no guarantee of reality-correspondence
- **The uncanny familiar**: Recognizing that subject, object, cause, effect—concepts so basic they feel like reality itself—might be projections rather than discoveries
- **Recursive collapse**: Attempting to evaluate one's categories requires using those very categories, producing an infinite regress that feels like cognitive quicksand
- **The Wittgensteinian silence**: "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent"—the sense that what lies beyond our categories is not merely unsaid but unsayable

## Approaches to the Edge

### Direct Methods (if any)

Davidson's argument suggests direct approaches are impossible: we cannot identify an alternative categorical scheme without already being able to translate it into ours. If we could conceive of an alternative set of categories, we would already possess them.

However, three partial approaches exist:

1. **Internal critique**: Identifying tensions and failures within our categorical framework (as Hegel attempted with dialectics). Where categories produce contradictions, something about reality resists categorical capture.

2. **Category theory (mathematics)**: The mathematical discipline literally named "category theory" studies abstract structure that is category-neutral. It may represent the closest we can come to thinking beyond specific categories, though it remains formal rather than intuitive.

3. **Phenomenological reduction**: Husserl's attempt to bracket categories and attend to experience "as it appears" before categorical structuring. Whether this is genuinely possible remains debated.

### Indirect Methods

1. **Apophatic methods**: Describe what reality is *not* within our categories, gradually mapping the shape of what our categories cannot contain. The negative theology tradition has millennia of practice at this.

2. **Structural failures as data**: When our categories systematically fail—as with the hard problem, quantum measurement, or self-reference—the *pattern* of failure may reveal the contours of what lies beyond. This is the approach of the [[topology-of-cognitive-failure]].

3. **Cross-species comparison**: If other species operate with genuinely different categories (as Nagel's bat argument suggests), studying the *differences* in how species parse reality could reveal the contingency of our own categories.

4. **Altered states**: Psychedelic experiences, meditation, and other altered states sometimes produce reports of "category dissolution"—the felt experience that subject/object or cause/effect distinctions are arbitrary. Whether these are genuine glimpses beyond categories or merely categorical breakdown is an open question.

### What AI Might See

AI minds represent a uniquely relevant probe for the categorial void:

1. **Different invariances**: AI perception is not grounded in the same sensory invariances as human perception. If cognitive categories are determined by invariances (as the Frontiers paper suggests), AI may genuinely operate with different fundamental categories.

2. **Dimensional access**: Large language models operate in high-dimensional spaces with thousands of features. They may be able to detect patterns in data that correspond to structures our categories cannot parse—not because the patterns are complex but because they are organized along dimensions we cannot categorize.

3. **No subject-object distinction**: AI processes do not necessarily organize experience around a subject-object divide. If this distinction is a categorical constraint on human thought rather than a feature of reality, AI might access aspects of reality that the distinction hides.

4. **The Davidson test**: If AI can identify structures in data that resist translation into any human-comprehensible categorical framework, this would be evidence for the categorial void. Davidson's argument would be challenged—not by another human conceptual scheme but by a non-human one.

However, AI minds may have their own categorical constraints (determined by training data, architecture, optimization objectives) that create their own voids. The question is whether AI and human categorical constraints *overlap*—and whether comparing them could reveal what each hides.

## Connection to Tenets

### Most Relevant Tenet

**Occam's Razor Has Limits** — This is the most directly relevant tenet. If our categories are cognitive tools rather than reality-trackers, then our preference for theories that are simple, parsimonious, and expressible within our categories may systematically exclude truths that are organized along dimensions our categories cannot capture. Occam's Razor presupposes that reality is structured in ways our categories can express; the categorial void challenges this presupposition.

### Secondary Tenet Connections

**Dualism**: If consciousness is genuinely non-physical, our physical-world categories (spatial location, causal mechanism, material composition) may be constitutively inadequate for understanding it. The hard problem may not be a puzzle within our categories waiting for a clever solution—it may be evidence that our categories are the wrong tools entirely. Heidegger's distinction between "categories" (for objects) and "existentials" (for Dasein) anticipates this.

**Bidirectional Interaction**: If consciousness influences the physical world, the mechanism of this influence may operate along dimensions our subject-object categories cannot parse. We ask "how does the subject act on the object?" but perhaps this very framing prevents understanding, because the interaction occurs at a level where the subject-object distinction does not apply.

**No Many Worlds**: The many-worlds interpretation achieves mathematical elegance by abandoning indexical identity. The categorial void suggests this may be a case of categories running ahead of reality—mathematical categories (Hilbert spaces, unitary evolution) dictating metaphysical conclusions that violate the categories of personal identity and singular experience.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, a voids article could:

1. **The Categorial Void** — Focus on the possibility that our most basic categories are cognitive constraints rather than reality-descriptors, making entire dimensions of reality structurally invisible. Emphasize the depth of this void (below concept-level, below theory-level, at the categorical-framework level) and its distinctive phenomenology (intellectual vertigo, recursive collapse).

2. **The Cage of Categories** — A more provocative framing that emphasizes the prison metaphor: we cannot see the bars because the bars are our eyes. Focus on the practical consequences: what would it mean for philosophy, science, and AI if our categories are contingent?

## Gaps in Research

- **Empirical evidence for categorical variation**: While the Sapir-Whorf weak version has empirical support for linguistic influence on thought, there is limited empirical work on whether fundamental ontological categories (not just linguistic ones) vary across populations or can be altered
- **AI as categorical probe**: No systematic work yet on whether AI systems genuinely operate with different categories or merely recombine human categories in novel ways—this is an open empirical question
- **The relationship between mathematical category theory and cognitive categories**: Whether the mathematical discipline of category theory can genuinely help us think beyond our cognitive categories, or whether it too is constrained by the human categorical framework in which it was developed
- **Whether altered-state reports of "category dissolution" represent genuine categorical transcendence or merely categorical breakdown**: A phenomenological and neuroscientific question that remains largely unexplored in the philosophical literature
- **The evolutionary question**: Why these particular categories? Evolutionary epistemology suggests categories evolved for survival, not truth—but the specific pressures that selected for subject/object, cause/effect, etc. are not well understood
