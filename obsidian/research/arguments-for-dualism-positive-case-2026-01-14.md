## Executive Summary

While the project extensively argues against materialism, this research strengthens the *positive* case for dualism. Contemporary philosophers have developed several powerful arguments beyond the classic objections to physicalism. The main arguments cluster around: (1) conceivability (zombies), (2) knowledge (Mary's Room), (3) qualia and phenomenal consciousness, (4) unity of consciousness, and (5) intentionality. Key contemporary defenders include David Chalmers (property dualism/naturalistic dualism), Richard Swinburne (substance dualism), William Hasker (emergent dualism), E.J. Lowe (non-Cartesian substance dualism), and more recently Rickabaugh & Moreland (comprehensive substance dualism defense, 2023). The 2020 PhilPapers survey shows 22% of professional philosophers accept or lean toward dualism—second only to materialism (51%).

## The Major Arguments

### 1. The Conceivability Argument (Zombie Argument)

**Chalmers' formulation (1996)**:
1. It is conceivable that a physical duplicate of a conscious human exists without consciousness (zombies are conceivable)
2. If zombies are conceivable, then zombies are metaphysically possible
3. If zombies are possible, then consciousness is not reducible to physical properties
4. Therefore, dualism is true (property or substance)

**Strength**: The argument bridges epistemology and metaphysics via two-dimensional semantics. Chalmers argues there's no gap between conceivability and possibility for consciousness because necessary a posteriori truths (like "water = H2O") don't apply—we have direct epistemic access to phenomenal concepts.

**Survey results (2020)**: Philosophers are divided—37% say "conceivable but impossible," 24% say "metaphysically possible," 16% say "inconceivable," 23% other. The argument remains influential.

### 2. The Knowledge Argument (Mary's Room)

**Jackson's formulation (1982/1986)**:
1. Mary knows all physical facts about color vision while in a black-and-white room
2. When Mary leaves and sees red for the first time, she learns something new
3. What she learns (what it's like to see red) cannot be deduced from physical facts
4. Therefore, there are non-physical facts about consciousness

**Jackson's own trajectory**: Jackson later rejected dualism, calling himself a "latter day physicalist." He stated in 2023: "I no longer accept the argument" but maintains it should be "addressed really seriously if you are a physicalist."

**Site connection**: The [[knowledge-argument]] article covers this in detail. The fact that Jackson himself became a physicalist doesn't refute the argument—it shows how difficult it is to abandon the intuition even for its creator.

### 3. Arguments from Qualia

Multiple arguments converge on qualia as evidence for dualism:

**The explanatory gap (Levine)**: Even complete physical knowledge leaves unexplained *why* neural processes are accompanied by qualitative experience.

**Inverted qualia**: Functional duplicates could differ in qualia, suggesting qualia aren't fixed by function.

**Absent qualia**: A physically/functionally identical system could lack qualia entirely (zombie variation).

**The intrinsic nature argument**: Physical science describes only relational/dispositional properties. Qualia reveal intrinsic properties of reality that physics misses.

### 4. The Unity of Consciousness Argument

**Historical roots**: Descartes and Leibniz argued that unified consciousness cannot emerge from extended matter composed of parts.

**Hasker's contemporary version**:
1. Conscious experience is unified—there is a single subject of experience
2. Physical systems are composed of discrete parts (neurons, molecules)
3. No physical mechanism explains how parts compose a unified experiential subject
4. Therefore, the subject is a simple, non-composite substance (the soul)

**The binding problem connection**: The [[binding-problem]] article notes that no neural mechanism explains phenomenal unity. This supports dualism: unity isn't *produced* by the brain but is an intrinsic feature of non-physical consciousness.

**Hasker's emergent dualism**: The soul is "generated by the functioning of a physical object" but is itself non-physical—an emergent substance rather than Cartesian soul.

### 5. Arguments from Intentionality

**Brentano's thesis**: Mental states exhibit intentionality (aboutness) that physical states lack.

**The naturalization failure**: Decades of attempts to reduce intentionality to physical relations (Dretske, Millikan) have failed. the project's [[intentionality]] article covers this.

**The Chinese Room**: Syntax (physical symbol manipulation) cannot produce genuine semantics (meaning, understanding).

### 6. The Modal Argument (Swinburne)

**Structure**:
1. It is logically possible for me to exist without my body
2. If I can exist without my body, I am not identical to my body
3. Therefore, I am a non-physical substance (soul)

**Swinburne's thisness**: What makes me *me* is not any qualitative property but the "thisness" of my soul—its individual identity distinct from everything else.

### 7. The Argument from Personal Identity

**Madell's version**: Mental identity conditions differ from bodily identity conditions. There's no sense to "partial overlap" of subjects the way there is for bodies. This suggests minds are mereologically simple substances.

**Connection to site**: The [[personal-identity]] article's rejection of Parfit's reductionism aligns with this—indexical identity matters in a way that defies physical reduction.

## Contemporary Defenders

### Property Dualists

**David Chalmers**: Developed "naturalistic dualism"—consciousness is a fundamental feature of reality alongside mass and charge, but need not require immaterial substances. Has recently expressed preference for substance dualism (2016).

### Substance Dualists

**Richard Swinburne** (*The Evolution of the Soul*, 1986; *Mind, Brain, & Free Will*, 2013): Defends traditional soul-body dualism. Persons are "pure mental substances" who can "exist logically independently of physical substances."

**E.J. Lowe** (*Subjects of Experience*, 1996): Non-Cartesian substance dualism. Persons and bodies are distinct substances, but persons aren't purely mental—they're embodied agents with both mental and physical aspects.

**William Hasker** (*The Emergent Self*, 1999): Emergent substance dualism. The soul emerges from brain function but is itself a non-physical substance. Not Cartesian—spatially located and generated by matter.

**Rickabaugh & Moreland** (*The Substance of Consciousness*, 2023): Comprehensive contemporary defense. "The human person is an embodied fundamental, immaterial, and unifying substance."

### The Dualist Revival

From the SEP: "The most influential arguments for dualism in contemporary philosophy focus on consciousness." Key works in the last decades have revived dualism from its mid-20th-century eclipse:
- Chalmers's *The Conscious Mind* (1996)
- Swinburne's *Mind, Brain, & Free Will* (2013)
- Lowe's *Personal Agency* (2008)
- Hasker's *The Emergent Self* (1999)
- Rickabaugh & Moreland's *The Substance of Consciousness* (2023)

## Parsimony Reconsidered

A common objection: dualism is less parsimonious than physicalism.

**Response** (supporting site's Occam's Razor Has Limits tenet):

1. **Quantitative vs. qualitative parsimony**: Dualism posits one additional category (consciousness) but physicalism posits none that explain the data. A theory that explains more with slightly more ontology may be preferable to one that explains less with less.

2. **Hidden complexity**: Physicalist theories often smuggle in consciousness-like concepts (information, function, representation) while claiming parsimony.

3. **Explanatory adequacy trumps parsimony**: A "simpler" theory that doesn't explain the phenomenon isn't superior—it's inadequate.

4. **Historical precedent**: Atomic theory was less parsimonious than continuous matter; quantum mechanics less than determinism. Parsimony alone doesn't track truth.

## Implications for Site Framework

### Strengthening the Tenets

The positive case for dualism goes beyond "materialism fails":

1. **Conceivability**: Zombies reveal a gap between physical and phenomenal
2. **Knowledge**: Mary learns something physical science can't teach
3. **Unity**: Phenomenal binding requires non-composite subject
4. **Intentionality**: Aboutness resists naturalization
5. **Identity**: Personal identity is simpler than bodily identity

### Avoiding Epiphenomenalism

A key challenge: if consciousness is non-physical, how does it interact with the physical?

the project's answer (Bidirectional Interaction + Minimal Quantum Interaction) addresses this:
- Quantum indeterminacy provides an "opening" for non-physical causation
- Consciousness selects among superposed states
- No energy injection; no violation of conservation laws

This distinguishes the project's position from epiphenomenal property dualism.

### Property vs. Substance Dualism

the project remains neutral between these, per the [[substance-property-dualism]] article. Both support the core claim: consciousness is irreducible.

- **Property dualism**: Physical systems have non-physical properties
- **Substance dualism**: Conscious beings are non-physical substances

The interactionist framework works for either: consciousness (whether property or substance) influences physical outcomes at quantum indeterminacies.

## Key Quotes

**Chalmers** (1996): "Consciousness poses the most baffling problems in the science of the mind. There is nothing that we know more intimately than conscious experience, but there is nothing that is harder to explain."

**Swinburne** (2013): "What makes me me is not any of my qualitative properties—not my mental life, and not my bodily life."

**Hasker** (1999): "The self of emergent dualism is not a Cartesian soul: it is generated by the functioning of a physical object and is itself spatially located."

**Jackson** (2023): "I no longer accept the argument... [but] it should be addressed really seriously if you are a physicalist."

**Survey (2020)**: 22% of professional philosophers accept or lean toward dualism—the second most popular position.

## Future Article Considerations

An "arguments for dualism" article should:

1. Present the positive case, not just objections to materialism
2. Cover conceivability, knowledge, qualia, unity, intentionality
3. Distinguish property from substance dualism
4. Address parsimony objection (connecting to Occam's Razor Has Limits)
5. Show how the project's quantum interactionism avoids epiphenomenalism
6. Note the ongoing philosophical debate and dualism's revival
