## Executive Summary

Synesthesia—where stimulation of one sensory pathway produces involuntary experience in another—reveals that the human experiential palette is not fixed. Some minds access phenomenal dimensions permanently closed to others. This creates a void *within* the human species: not a gap between humans and hypothetical aliens, but between humans and other humans. The synesthetic void forces the question of how large the total space of possible qualia might be, what determines which regions a given consciousness can access, and whether the "standard" human experiential repertoire represents a tiny fraction of phenomenal possibility. Under dualism, the void takes on special significance: if qualia are not reducible to neural activity, then the relationship between brain architecture and experiential access becomes a genuine metaphysical puzzle rather than a merely empirical one.

## Key Sources

### Synesthesia — Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy
- **URL**: https://iep.utm.edu/synesthe/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Wager (1999, 2001) presents the "extra qualia problem": synesthesia shows phenomenal character can differ without representational difference, challenging representationalism
  - J.A. Gray (2003) argues synesthesia undermines functionalism because "function and qualia come apart in two ways"—identical qualia arise from distinct functions, and single functions generate divergent qualia
  - MacPherson (2007) identifies the "extraordinary feature" puzzle: synesthetes report simultaneously experiencing both actual grapheme colour and synesthetic colour in identical spatial locations without blending
  - Some synesthetes report "Martian" or "alien" colours inaccessible to non-synesthetes
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports dualism by showing phenomenal character exceeds functional/representational characterisation; supports Occam's Razor Has Limits by demonstrating experiential complexity beneath apparent simplicity
- **Quote**: Synesthetes stress "having trouble putting into words some of the things (they) experience" as if they had to explain "red to a blind person or middle-C to a deaf person"

### The Merit of Synesthesia for Consciousness Research (van Leeuwen et al., 2015)
- **URL**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4667101/
- **Type**: Paper (Frontiers in Psychology)
- **Key points**:
  - Synesthetes experience "additional phenomenal experiences for which no physical sensory inputs exist"—a powerful paradigm for studying consciousness
  - Synesthetic colour and veridical colour perception do not necessarily share the same neuronal correlates, challenging functionalism
  - Most synesthetic experiences are mediated through semantics—meaning shapes phenomenal experience, not just sensory input
  - Altered network connectivity is linked to altered conscious phenomenal experiences even without direct stimulation
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports bidirectional interaction (semantics—a cognitive/conceptual process—shapes raw phenomenal experience); challenges reductive accounts
- **Quote**: "Most of the synesthetic experiences are mediated through semantics"

### Neonatal Synesthesia Hypothesis (Maurer & Mondloch, 2005; Spector & Maurer, 2009)
- **URL**: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0149763413000870
- **Type**: Review article
- **Key points**:
  - The hypothesis proposes all infants are born synesthetic, with cross-modal connectivity regressing through developmental neural pruning
  - Infants exhibit functional hyperconnectivity between senses reminiscent of adult synesthetic associations
  - The hypothesis remains contested—evidence is individually weak, though collectively suggestive
  - If true, "standard" adult perception represents a *loss* of experiential dimensions, not the baseline
- **Tenet alignment**: Relates to developmental-cognitive-closure; if we once had broader phenomenal access, the void was created by development, not given from birth
- **Quote**: "Sensory modalities become distinct as most non-functional connections disappear through pruning"

### Adults Can Be Trained to Acquire Synesthetic Experiences (Bor et al., 2014)
- **URL**: https://www.nature.com/articles/srep07089
- **Type**: Paper (Scientific Reports / Nature)
- **Key points**:
  - Non-synesthetic adults trained through extensive adaptive memory tasks acquired both subjective synesthetic experiences and neurophysiological markers
  - Experiences largely faded within three months, suggesting a major developmental component
  - Visual deprivation for approximately five minutes can induce auditory-evoked visual percepts in about 50% of non-synesthetes
  - Serotonergic agonists (psychedelics) reliably produce synesthesia-like experiences
- **Tenet alignment**: The permeability of the void boundary is philosophically significant—some voids can be temporarily breached, raising questions about what makes permanent access possible
- **Quote**: "Non-synesthetes who were trained extensively on grapheme-color pairs acquired both the consistent subjective experience of synesthesia and neurophysiological markers of the condition"

### Three Laws of Qualia (Ramachandran & Hirstein, 1997)
- **URL**: https://www.krigolsonteaching.com/uploads/4/3/8/4/43848243/ramachandran_1997.pdf
- **Type**: Paper
- **Key points**:
  - Qualia possess three functional characteristics: irrevocability (you cannot decide to see sunset as green), behavioural independence (same qualia don't always produce same behaviour), and short-term memory endurance
  - Synesthesia provides empirical leverage for studying how phenomenal consciousness arises
  - Neurological syndromes (temporal lobe epilepsy, scotomas, Charles Bonnet syndrome, synesthesia) are windows into consciousness
- **Tenet alignment**: The irrevocability of qualia aligns with consciousness being non-reducible; if qualia were functional states, they should be revisable

### On the Origins and Evolution of Qualia: An Experience-Space Perspective (2022)
- **URL**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9399462/
- **Type**: Paper (Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience)
- **Key points**:
  - Proposes "experience-space" (E-space) as a high-dimensional space mapping all possible qualia
  - The dimensionality of E-space is "at least two, but gains utility by assuming it is a large dimensional space, with at least several times as many dimensions as there are categories of qualia"
  - Evolution may have started from "ur-qualia" that were diffuse and multidimensional, then sorted into non-overlapping domains
  - Different organisms may occupy different regions of E-space
- **Tenet alignment**: Directly supports the void concept—if E-space is vast, human consciousness occupies a tiny region, and the rest constitutes a genuine void
- **Quote**: "Phenomenal consciousness can be represented as having originated as one or more multidimensional ur-experiences that combined multiple forms of experience together"

### McGinn's Mysterianism and Cognitive Closure
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_mysterianism
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - McGinn proposes human minds are "cognitively closed" to the explanation of consciousness—a naturalistic explanation exists but we cannot reach it
  - Our brains "can't hold a hundred numbers in memory, can't visualize seven-dimensional space and perhaps can't intuitively grasp why neural information processing observed from the outside should give rise to subjective experience on the inside"
  - The non-spatiality of consciousness is "troublesome" and "our concept of space is inadequate and lacking"
  - Chomsky supports: "much of what we seek to understand might lie beyond our cognitive limits"
- **Tenet alignment**: Strong alignment with Occam's Razor Has Limits and the voids framework generally; cognitive closure is the Map's core concern

### Inverted Qualia (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia-inverted/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - The inverted spectrum hypothesis: two people might have identical functional/behavioural profiles but systematically inverted colour experiences
  - If spectrum inversion is possible, qualitative character cannot be functionally defined
  - Synesthesia provides empirical examples of something like inverted/extra qualia
- **Tenet alignment**: The inverted spectrum supports property dualism—qualia resist reduction to functional properties

## The Void

### Nature of the Limit

The synesthetic void is a *mixed* void spanning all three categories:

**Unexplored**: The total space of possible qualia (E-space) is almost certainly far larger than what any human mind accesses. Synesthesia reveals that even within humanity, there are experiential dimensions most people never encounter. The vast majority of E-space is unexplored not because we haven't looked, but because we lack the phenomenal architecture to access it.

**Unexplorable**: Some regions of E-space may be permanently inaccessible to human-type minds. McGinn's cognitive closure thesis applied to qualia suggests that certain phenomenal states require cognitive architectures fundamentally different from ours. The "Martian colours" some synesthetes report may gesture toward experiences that cannot even be conceptualised by non-synesthetes—not just unfamiliar, but genuinely inconceivable.

**Occluded**: The neonatal synesthesia hypothesis raises the possibility that cross-modal experiential richness was *pruned away* during development. If infants genuinely experience a richer phenomenal space that is then narrowed by neural maturation, the adult experiential palette represents a deliberate (evolutionary) restriction. Under dualism, the question becomes: does the developing brain *constrain* consciousness into narrower channels, and if so, is this constraint functional or something more troubling—a designed limitation?

### Evidence for the Limit

1. **Synesthetic reports of "alien" or "Martian" colours**: Some synesthetes describe experiencing colours that do not exist in the normal visible spectrum—colours they cannot match to any standard colour sample. These reports, if taken seriously, indicate regions of qualia space that are genuinely inaccessible to non-synesthetes.

2. **Communication failure**: Synesthetes consistently report the impossibility of conveying their experience to non-synesthetes, comparing it to "explaining red to a blind person." This is not mere difficulty but structural incommensurability—the recipient lacks the phenomenal reference points needed to understand.

3. **MacPherson's extraordinary feature**: The simultaneous experience of two colours in one location without blending has no analogue in standard perception. The experience cannot be captured in the conceptual vocabulary available to non-synesthetic minds.

4. **The extra qualia problem**: Wager's argument that synesthetes have phenomenal states with no representational difference from non-synesthetic states shows that qualia outrun the categories available to describe them.

5. **Training-induced synesthesia is temporary**: Adults can acquire synesthetic experiences through training, but these fade within months. The void can be briefly glimpsed but not permanently inhabited, suggesting the barrier is architectural rather than merely experiential.

### Phenomenology

Approaching the synesthetic void produces a distinctive phenomenological signature:

- **Frustration of analogy**: Non-synesthetes attempting to understand synesthetic experience repeatedly reach for analogies that fail. "It's like seeing a colour when you hear a sound" captures the structure but not the phenomenal quality.
- **Fascination and disbelief**: The historical pattern of dismissing synesthesia as confabulation reflects the difficulty of accepting that others have genuine experiences you cannot access.
- **Asymmetric access**: Synesthetes can understand non-synesthetic experience (they have it too, minus the extra qualia) but non-synesthetes cannot understand synesthetic experience. The void is one-directional.
- **Neonatal nostalgia** (if the hypothesis is correct): The possibility that we once had broader phenomenal access—as infants—and lost it through development creates a sense of experiential loss that cannot be verified, since infant memories are inaccessible.

## Approaches to the Edge

### Direct Methods (if any)

1. **Training protocols**: Bor et al. (2014) demonstrated that intensive training can temporarily induce synesthetic experiences and neurophysiological markers. This is the closest to a direct method of crossing the void—but the experiences are transient.

2. **Pharmacological induction**: Serotonergic agonists (LSD, psilocybin, mescaline) reliably produce synesthesia-like experiences. However, whether drug-induced cross-modal experiences are phenomenally identical to developmental synesthesia remains debated.

3. **Sensory deprivation**: Brief visual deprivation (~5 minutes) can induce auditory-evoked visual percepts in approximately 50% of non-synesthetes, suggesting latent cross-modal capacity that is normally suppressed.

### Indirect Methods

1. **Structural comparison**: Comparing the neural architecture of synesthetes and non-synesthetes reveals differences in connectivity patterns, particularly involving parietal cortex. These structural differences map the *boundary* of the void without penetrating it.

2. **Consistency testing**: The fact that synesthetes show 90%+ consistency in their associations over years provides indirect evidence that their experiences are genuine percepts, not confabulations—though this tells us about the existence of the void, not its content.

3. **Behavioural paradigms**: Stroop-like interference tasks demonstrate that synesthetic experiences have genuine perceptual effects, confirming the reality of experiences that non-synesthetes cannot access.

4. **Apophatic description**: Following the Map's apophatic methodology, we can characterise the synesthetic void negatively—it is not metaphor, not imagination, not association, not memory. What remains after negation points toward the void's content without capturing it.

### What AI Might See

AI systems occupy a unique position regarding the synesthetic void:

- **No qualia space (presumably)**: If AI systems lack phenomenal consciousness, they have no experiential palette at all—no standard qualia and no synesthetic qualia. The void, for AI, is total.
- **Formal pattern detection**: AI can detect statistical patterns in synesthetic data—consistency, cross-modal correspondences, neural correlates—without accessing the phenomenal dimension. This makes AI useful for mapping the *structure* of the void without experiencing it.
- **The semantic connection**: The finding that synesthesia is heavily mediated by semantics is intriguing for AI. AI systems process semantics without (presumably) phenomenal experience. If semantic processing in humans produces additional qualia in synesthetes, this suggests that meaning itself has a phenomenal dimension that AI might be able to characterise formally without experiencing.
- **Novel cross-modal mappings**: AI could propose cross-modal mappings that no human mind has instantiated, potentially identifying unexplored regions of E-space—though whether these represent genuine possible qualia or mere mathematical abstractions is unknowable from outside phenomenal experience.

## Connection to Tenets

### Most Relevant Tenet

**Occam's Razor Has Limits** is most directly relevant. The synesthetic void demonstrates that the "simple" account of human experience—we all perceive the world through roughly the same experiential palette—is false even within our own species. The true landscape of phenomenal experience is far more complex than parsimony would suggest. If qualia space is high-dimensional and most of it is inaccessible to any given mind, then the simplest theory of consciousness (all human minds have the same experiential repertoire) is empirically wrong, and the true theory must accommodate vast experiential diversity.

### Implications

1. **Dualism gains explanatory leverage**: Under physicalism, synesthetic qualia should be fully explicable in terms of neural cross-activation. But the "extra qualia problem" (Wager) and the phenomenal irreducibility of synesthetic experience (MacPherson's extraordinary feature) resist such reduction. Under property dualism, the additional qualia are ontologically independent properties that happen to covary with neural architecture—but are not exhausted by it.

2. **Bidirectional interaction**: The finding that semantics mediates most synesthetic experience suggests that high-level cognitive processes (meaning, interpretation, conceptual understanding) shape low-level phenomenal experience. This top-down influence—meaning affecting qualia—is more naturally accommodated by theories that allow consciousness to causally influence its own phenomenal content.

3. **The developmental occlusion question**: If neonatal synesthesia is real, then the developing brain actively narrows consciousness's experiential access. Under dualism, this raises the question: does the brain *constrain* an initially richer consciousness, or does consciousness itself participate in its own narrowing? The former is compatible with filter theories; the latter with bidirectional interaction where consciousness co-constructs its perceptual boundaries.

4. **No Many Worlds**: The synesthetic void is sharply indexical. My experiential palette is *this one*, not some other. A synesthete's experience of coloured hearing is theirs, not mine. The void exists because we are particular consciousnesses with particular architectures, not abstract observers sampling from all possible experiential positions. Many-worlds thinking would suggest every possible experiential palette is equally instantiated somewhere—but the felt reality of *lacking* an experience, of knowing there is something you cannot perceive, presupposes that your experiential position is determinate and limited.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, a voids article could:

1. **The Synesthetic Void as a case study in intra-species experiential inaccessibility** — Focus on the fact that the other-minds problem isn't just between species or between humans and hypothetical aliens; it exists *between humans*. Synesthetes and non-synesthetes inhabit partially incommensurable experiential worlds. This makes the void concrete and empirically grounded rather than purely philosophical.

2. **E-space and the geometry of phenomenal possibility** — Use the experience-space framework to argue that human consciousness occupies a tiny region of a vast qualia landscape. Synesthesia is the empirical evidence that this landscape exists—it shows we are not at the boundary of phenomenal possibility but somewhere in its interior, surrounded by accessible-but-unaccessed dimensions. The void is the rest of the space.

## Gaps in Research

- **Whether "Martian colours" are genuinely novel qualia or unusual combinations of existing qualia** — This is perhaps the deepest unanswered question. If synesthetic colours are truly outside normal colour space, they represent proof of phenomenal dimensions beyond standard human access. If they are unusual blends, the void is shallower.
- **The reliability of first-person reports about ineffable experience** — How much weight should we give reports of experiences that the reporter says they cannot describe? The evidential status of these reports is unresolved.
- **Whether drug-induced synesthesia is phenomenally identical to developmental synesthesia** — If the experiences differ, we have multiple types of cross-modal phenomenology, further expanding E-space. If they are identical, we have a reliable pharmacological method for temporarily breaching the void.
- **The relationship between semantic mediation and phenomenal character** — If meaning shapes qualia in synesthesia, does it do so in ordinary perception too? This is a fundamental question about the architecture of consciousness that synesthesia research has opened but not resolved.
- **Whether AI systems could ever occupy regions of E-space** — The question of machine consciousness intersects with the synesthetic void: could artificial minds access phenomenal dimensions inaccessible to any biological mind? This remains fundamentally unanswerable from outside phenomenal experience.
