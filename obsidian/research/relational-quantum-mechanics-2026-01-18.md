## Executive Summary

Relational Quantum Mechanics (RQM), developed by Carlo Rovelli since 1996, proposes that quantum states are not absolute properties of systems but relations between systems. There is no "view from nowhere"—all facts are relative to specific observers (where "observer" means any physical system, not necessarily conscious). This research explores whether RQM resolves the multi-observer collapse problem raised in The Unfinishable Map's framework, and evaluates its implications for consciousness-causes-collapse approaches like Stapp's. The key finding: RQM explicitly removes any special role for consciousness, treating measurement as ordinary physical interaction. This conflicts directly with the Map's tenets. However, RQM's treatment of locality and multi-observer scenarios reveals important considerations for any quantum-consciousness framework dealing with multiple minds.

## Key Sources

### Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Relational Quantum Mechanics
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-relational/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Central claim: "different observers can give different accounts of the same set of events"
  - Physical variables have values only relative to other systems
  - Rejects ontic construal of wave function—it's a calculational tool, not reality
  - Discrete events ("flashes") where variables actualize through interactions constitute the ontology
  - Inspired by special relativity's lesson that reference frames matter
- **Tenet alignment**: **Conflicts with Bidirectional Interaction**—RQM explicitly states "there is nothing subjective, idealistic, or mentalistic" in the interpretation
- **Quote**: "RQM does not preserve certain classical relativistic intuitions about relations: it extends them and makes them more radical ('facts are relative')."

### Adlam & Rovelli (2023) - "Information is Physical: Cross-Perspective Links"
- **URL**: https://philosophyofphysics.lse.ac.uk/articles/10.31389/pop.8
- **Type**: Journal article (Philosophy of Physics)
- **Key points**:
  - Addresses the intersubjectivity problem in RQM
  - Proposes "Cross-Perspective Link" (CPL) postulate: measurement of a system's pointer reveals the outcome that system registered earlier
  - Strong interpretation: absolute facts about relations between perspectives
  - Weak interpretation: what third-party observers can verify, preserving perspectivalism
  - Introduces discrete quantum events ("flashes") as observer-independent
- **Tenet alignment**: Neutral—CPL revision moves RQM toward event realism, but still no role for consciousness
- **Quote**: "All of the information possessed by a certain observer is stored in physical variables of that observer and thus accessible by measurement to other observers."

### Martin-Dussaud, Rovelli & Zalamea (2019) - "The Notion of Locality in RQM"
- **URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08150
- **Type**: Journal article (Foundations of Physics)
- **Key points**:
  - Claims RQM is local despite Bell violations
  - "Failure of locality in the sense of Bell reduces to existence of common cause in indeterministic context"
  - No need for "mysterious space-like influence"
  - EPR correlations explained by relational properties, not superluminal causation
- **Tenet alignment**: Relevant to site's locality concerns, but controversial claim
- **Quote**: "Neither causes nor effects travel faster than light whatsoever."

### Laudisa (2019) - "Open Problems in Relational Quantum Mechanics"
- **URL**: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10838-019-09450-0
- **Type**: Journal article (Journal for General Philosophy of Science)
- **Key points**:
  - Argues RQM's relativization of states to observers is unclear about what it achieves
  - Questions whether RQM truly preserves locality
  - Identifies "third person problem" as unresolved
- **Tenet alignment**: Critical perspective useful for evaluating RQM
- **Quote**: "It is far from clear what a relativization of states to observers exactly achieves."

### Lewis (2024) - "A Dilemma for Relational Quantum Mechanics"
- **URL**: https://arxiv.org/html/2410.20012
- **Type**: Preprint
- **Key points**:
  - RQM suffers from "epistemic solipsism"—observer can't know anything beyond immediate experience
  - This is self-undermining: removes evidence for quantum mechanics itself
  - Dilemma: reject shared facts → solipsism/island universes; reject observer-relative comparisons → lose RQM's distinctiveness
- **Tenet alignment**: Raises problems relevant to site's concern with other minds
- **Quote**: "An observer can't in principle know anything beyond their immediate present experience."

## Major Positions

### Relational Quantum Mechanics (Rovelli)
- **Proponents**: Carlo Rovelli, Francesca Vidotto, Matteo Smerlak
- **Core claim**: Quantum states are relations between physical systems, not intrinsic properties. There is no observer-independent reality. Facts are relative to perspectives.
- **Key arguments**:
  1. Inspired by special relativity—velocity is always relative, why not quantum states?
  2. Dissolves measurement problem by relativizing collapse to each observer
  3. Any physical system can be an "observer"—no special role for consciousness
  4. Ontology consists of discrete events (interactions) where variables actualize
- **Relation to site tenets**: **Direct conflict**. RQM explicitly rejects consciousness as special. Rovelli: "There is nothing subjective, idealistic, or mentalistic, in RQM." The interpretation succeeds specifically by *removing* any role for mind in measurement. This contradicts [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]].

### Consciousness-Causes-Collapse (von Neumann-Wigner)
- **Proponents**: John von Neumann (partially), Eugene Wigner (initially), Henry Stapp (currently)
- **Core claim**: Consciousness plays a special role in wave function collapse—mental observation causes reduction.
- **Key arguments**:
  1. Measurement problem requires something to select outcomes
  2. Von Neumann's infinite regress requires a final non-physical observer
  3. Intentionality and subjective experience are fundamental features of observation
- **Relation to site tenets**: **Aligns with** Bidirectional Interaction and Minimal Quantum Interaction. the Map's framework follows this tradition via Stapp's quantum Zeno approach.

### QBism (Quantum Bayesianism)
- **Proponents**: Christopher Fuchs, Ruediger Schack, David Mermin
- **Core claim**: Quantum states are degrees of belief, not descriptions of reality. Subjective, agent-centered.
- **Key arguments**:
  1. Wave function represents agent's information/expectations
  2. Measurement updates beliefs, not external reality
  3. Avoids measurement problem by denying objective states exist
- **Relation to site tenets**: Mixed. Shares RQM's rejection of observer-independent states but explicitly agent-centered. Still doesn't give consciousness a *causal* role.

## Key Debates

### The Multi-Observer Collapse Problem

**This is the central problem that motivated the research request.**

- **The problem**: If consciousness causes collapse, and there are multiple conscious minds, how are their selections reconciled? When two minds observe the same quantum system, do they each cause collapse independently? Does one collapse affect all minds (nonlocality)? Or can multiple independent collapses coexist?
- **RQM's answer**: There is no problem because there is no absolute collapse. Each observer has their own relative state. When observer A measures a system, it collapses *relative to A*. When observer B measures, it collapses *relative to B*. The two need not agree until they interact.
- **Core disagreement**: RQM dissolves the problem by relativizing facts; consciousness-causes-collapse must explain how multiple minds coordinate.
- **Current state**: RQM claims resolution via perspectivalism. Consciousness-causes-collapse theories (like Stapp's) don't fully address this. the Map's framework inherits this open problem.

### Wigner's Friend
- **Sides**: RQM (consistent via relativization) vs. objective collapse views (paradoxical)
- **Core disagreement**: Does the friend have a definite experience before Wigner observes? RQM: yes, relative to friend; no, relative to Wigner—both true. Objective views: must resolve this as genuine paradox.
- **Current state**: Extended Wigner's friend experiments (Frauchiger-Renner 2018) sharpen the paradox. RQM claims resolution; consciousness theorists must address it.

### Locality and Bell's Theorem
- **Sides**: RQM (claims locality via common cause) vs. critics (says this empties locality of meaning)
- **Core disagreement**: Martin-Dussaud et al. argue Bell violations reduce to "common cause in indeterministic context." Pienaar responds this "deprives locality of meaningful definition."
- **Current state**: Controversial. If RQM truly preserves locality, it has advantage over consciousness-causes-collapse approaches that may require nonlocal coordination between minds.

### Intersubjectivity and Solipsism
- **Sides**: RQM proponents (shared facts emerge through interaction) vs. critics (leads to epistemic solipsism)
- **Core disagreement**: If facts are relative, how can science work? How can we trust reports from other observers?
- **Current state**: The 2023 Cross-Perspective Links postulate attempts to address this, but critics argue it abandons RQM's distinctiveness. Lewis's dilemma claims both horns are unacceptable.

## The Multi-Mind Collapse Problem: Detailed Analysis

The user's request specifically asked: "If consciousness causes collapse AND there are other minds, multiple minds are selecting from neural firing patterns via collapse. How are these selections reconciled?"

### Option 1: Nonlocal Coordination
If collapse is absolute and one mind's collapse affects the universal wave function, then:
- One collapse creates facts for all observers instantaneously
- This requires nonlocal correlation between minds
- Conflicts with relativity unless collapse is outside spacetime
- **Problem**: Whose collapse "wins"? First in time? Most attention? Arbitrary?

### Option 2: Relational Resolution (RQM's Answer)
Multiple independent perspectives can coexist:
- Each mind has relative facts that need not agree
- Agreement emerges only through interaction
- No coordination problem because no absolute facts
- **Problem**: Explicitly removes consciousness's special role—contradicts site tenets

### Option 3: Interface Locality (Potential Site Position)
The Map's [[interface-locality]] concept may help:
- Each consciousness interfaces only with "its" brain
- Collapses are local to specific neural systems
- No mind can affect distant systems without physical mediation
- **Problem**: Still unclear how two minds observing the *same* quantum system coordinate

### Option 4: Objective Collapse with Consciousness Modulation
Compatible with site's [[prebiotic-collapse]] resolution:
- Physical mechanisms provide baseline collapse everywhere
- Consciousness modulates (biases) collapse in brains
- Each mind only modulates its own neural collapse
- External systems collapse physically, not mentally
- **Advantage**: Dissolves multi-mind problem for external observations; each mind only controls its own interface

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, an article could:

1. **"Against Relational Quantum Mechanics from Dualism"**: Argue that RQM fails because it explicitly removes the role of consciousness that the Map's tenets require. While RQM elegantly dissolves measurement problems, it does so by denying what the Map affirms: that consciousness is special. The price is too high for dualists.

2. **"The Multi-Mind Collapse Problem"**: Develop the problem of coordinating multiple conscious observers in consciousness-causes-collapse frameworks. Survey options: nonlocal coordination, interface locality, objective-collapse-plus-modulation. Argue that the Map's framework (consciousness modulates collapse locally) resolves the problem better than pure consciousness-causes-collapse.

3. **"Lessons from Relational Quantum Mechanics"**: Even rejecting RQM's core claim, extract useful insights: (a) the legitimacy of multiple perspectives prior to interaction, (b) the analogy with special relativity's reference frames, (c) the common-cause treatment of EPR correlations. These might inform how a consciousness-based framework handles multi-observer scenarios.

4. **"Relational vs. Consciousness Interpretations: A Comparative Analysis"**: Neutral comparison article laying out the trade-offs. RQM: dissolves measurement problem but eliminates consciousness. Consciousness-causes-collapse: preserves mental causation but faces multi-observer problem. Neither approach is problem-free.

**Recommended angle for article**: Option 2 or 4—the multi-mind problem deserves dedicated treatment, and the comparison with RQM highlights what's at stake.

When writing the article, follow `obsidian/project/writing-style.md` for:
- Named-anchor summary technique for forward references
- Background vs. novelty decisions (RQM is well-documented; focus on novel connections to site framework)
- Tenet alignment requirements (explicit engagement with how RQM conflicts with tenets)
- LLM optimization (front-load the key finding: RQM removes consciousness)

## Gaps in Research

- **QBism comparison**: QBism shares perspectivalism with RQM but is explicitly agent-centered. Deeper comparison would clarify how "subjective" interpretations handle consciousness differently.
- **Penrose's objective reduction**: How does Orch OR handle multi-observer scenarios? If collapse is gravitational, it's presumably observer-independent.
- **Stapp on multiple minds**: Has Stapp explicitly addressed the multi-mind coordination problem?
- **Empirical tests**: Are there proposed experiments that distinguish RQM from consciousness-causes-collapse?
- **Buddhist philosophy**: the Map's existing Buddhist content might connect to RQM's "no view from nowhere" claim.
