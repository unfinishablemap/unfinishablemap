# Research: Voids - The Language-Thought Boundary

**Date**: 2026-01-26
**Search queries used**: "linguistic relativity thought Sapir-Whorf limits cognition", "Wittgenstein Tractatus limits of language limits of thought", "language of thought hypothesis Fodor cognitive limits", "ineffability philosophy language cannot express consciousness", "thought without language cognition nonverbal thinking", "language shapes thought modern research color perception", "limits of expressibility philosophy Chomsky", "apophatic negative philosophy unsayable Derrida différance"
**Voids category**: Mixed (Unexplorable / Occluded)

## Executive Summary

The relationship between language and thought constitutes a fundamental cognitive boundary. While the strong Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (language determines thought) is largely rejected, substantial evidence supports the weaker claim that language significantly influences habitual patterns of cognition. More importantly for the voids framework, multiple philosophical traditions converge on the insight that some content may be inherently inexpressible—not merely difficult to articulate but structurally beyond linguistic capture. Wittgenstein's Tractatus project, negative theology's apophatic tradition, and contemporary research on qualia and ineffability all suggest that the boundary between speakable and unspeakable may constitute a genuine void rather than merely unexplored territory.

## Key Sources

### Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus
- **URL**: [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/)
- **Type**: Encyclopedia / Primary philosophical text
- **Key points**:
  - The Tractatus attempts to delineate precisely what can and cannot be sensically said
  - Language, thought, and world are isomorphic—limits of language equal limits of thought
  - Proposition 7: "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent"
  - The book acknowledges itself as nonsense—a ladder to be climbed and then thrown away
  - Drawing a limit to thought would require thinking both sides of the limit, including the unthinkable
- **Tenet alignment**: Strongly aligns with Occam's Razor Has Limits—Wittgenstein recognized that some truths exceed our conceptual apparatus
- **Quote**: "The limits of my language mean the limits of my world."

### Linguistic Relativity (Sapir-Whorf) Research
- **URL**: [Stanford Encyclopedia - Whorfianism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/linguistics/whorfianism.html)
- **Type**: Encyclopedia / Research overview
- **Key points**:
  - Strong form (linguistic determinism) is largely rejected
  - Weak form (language influences thought) has substantial empirical support
  - Color perception differs based on linguistic color categories (Russian blue distinction)
  - Temporal cognition differs (English horizontal vs. Mandarin vertical metaphors)
  - Spatial reasoning differs (Kuuk Thaayorre absolute vs. English relative directions)
  - Bilinguals shift cognitive biases depending on which language they're using
- **Tenet alignment**: Suggests that cognitive architecture shapes accessible thought—relates to mysterianism's cognitive closure
- **Quote**: "The past decade has seen a host of ingenious demonstrations establishing that language indeed plays a causal role in shaping cognition."

### Jerry Fodor and the Language of Thought
- **URL**: [Stanford Encyclopedia - Language of Thought](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/language-thought/)
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - LOTH proposes thought has language-like compositional structure ("mentalese")
  - Fodor himself acknowledged significant limits to the computational theory of mind
  - Context-dependent thought cannot be fully captured by context-independent syntax
  - Much cognition may lie outside computational models
  - The hypothesis addresses internal representation, not external linguistic expression
- **Tenet alignment**: Even internal "mentalese" may have structural limits—some thoughts might not be representable in any mental language
- **Quote**: "There is much cognition that cannot be understood on a computational model."

### Chomsky on the Limits of Understanding
- **URL**: [Chomsky.info - Science, Mind, and Limits](https://chomsky.info/201401__/)
- **Type**: Academic lecture / Interview
- **Key points**:
  - Human language uses "finite means to express an unlimited array of thoughts"
  - Despite this expressiveness, intentionality (how words refer to world) remains mysterious
  - The "creative aspect" of language may never be understood
  - "The boundaries of Babel"—limits of variation that may affect human languages
  - Cognitive limitations may be inherent, not merely current ignorance
- **Tenet alignment**: Strongly supports Occam's Razor Has Limits—Chomsky explicitly notes that some problems may exceed human cognitive capacity
- **Quote**: "It might turn out that 'free actions of men' cannot be accommodated in terms of determinacy and randomness."

### Ineffability and Philosophy
- **URL**: [Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews - Ineffability and Philosophy](https://ndpr.nd.edu/reviews/ineffability-and-philosophy/)
- **Type**: Academic review
- **Key points**:
  - Four types of ineffability: objects/properties, propositions, mental contents, knowledge
  - Weak ineffability: rooted in a particular language's deficiencies
  - Strong ineffability: stems from cognitive system structure itself
  - Mystical experiences are ineffable because they involve dissolution of subject-object structure
  - The paradox: claiming something is ineffable is itself saying something about it
- **Tenet alignment**: Strong ineffability (cognitive-structural) aligns with McGinn's cognitive closure and the Map's mysterianism
- **Quote**: "Mystical experiences are ineffable because they cannot be conceptualized, and they can't be conceptualized because they involve a particular state of consciousness."

### William Franke's Philosophy of the Unsayable
- **URL**: [University of Notre Dame Press - A Philosophy of the Unsayable](https://undpress.nd.edu/9780268028947/a-philosophy-of-the-unsayable/)
- **Type**: Scholarly monograph
- **Key points**:
  - Negative theology is "a kind of perennial counter-philosophy to the philosophy of Logos"
  - The unsayable is the basis for all that is said
  - Apophatic thinking recognizes ultimate principles as beyond reach of reason and speech
  - Neoplatonism represents crisis of Greek metaphysics—inability to rationally account for foundations
  - Resurgence of apophatic thought across humanities, not just theology
- **Tenet alignment**: Apophatic tradition directly parallels the Map's approach to voids—mapping boundaries rather than claiming to map content
- **Quote**: "Counter-discourses typically emphasize that what is not and even cannot be said is actually the basis for all that is said."

### Derrida and Negative Theology
- **URL**: [Academia.edu - Apophatic Elements in Derrida's Deconstruction](https://www.academia.edu/9202891/Apophatic_Elements_in_Derridas_Deconstruction)
- **Type**: Academic paper
- **Key points**:
  - Différance shares "family resemblance" with negative theology
  - Both traditions concern limits of language
  - Derrida critiques negative theology for relying on ontological presence
  - Différance, like the ineffable, resists definition within the logic it challenges
  - Derrida denied his work was negative theology despite structural similarities
- **Tenet alignment**: The difficulty of articulating différance exemplifies how fundamental structures may exceed linguistic capture
- **Quote**: "To define these terms is to circumscribe them within the logic against which, by definition, they struggle."

### Thought Without Language
- **URL**: [Brain Health University - Can You Think Without Language?](https://brainhealthuniversity.com/brain-health-insights/can-you-think-without-language/)
- **Type**: Science communication
- **Key points**:
  - Visual thinking (Temple Grandin), musical thought, kinesthetic thought exist independently of language
  - Infants demonstrate cognition before language acquisition
  - Less than 30% of population strongly uses visual/spatial thinking; 25% think exclusively in words
  - Language is a cognitive amplifier, not prerequisite for thought
  - Some thought operates independently of linguistic structuring
- **Tenet alignment**: Demonstrates that linguistic limits don't equal cognitive limits—but also that non-linguistic thought may have its own inaccessible territories
- **Quote**: "Some individuals report thinking primarily in images... [Einstein's] scientific insights emerged from visual thought experiments before being translated into equations or words."

### Qualia and the Explanatory Gap
- **URL**: [Stanford Encyclopedia - Qualia](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia/)
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Qualia are characterized as ineffable, intrinsic, private, and directly apprehensible
  - They cannot be communicated by any means other than direct experience
  - The explanatory gap: first-person experience resists third-person description
  - McGinn's cognitive closure applies specifically to explaining qualia
  - Thomas Nagel: subjective experience is accessible only to the individual undergoing it
- **Tenet alignment**: Core support for Dualism tenet—qualia's ineffability suggests consciousness exceeds physical/linguistic description
- **Quote**: "Qualia are at the very heart of the mind-body problem."

## The Void

### Nature of the Limit

This is a mixed void—partially Unexplorable (structural limits of language-thought interface) and partially Occluded (certain content may resist articulation for systematic reasons).

The language-thought boundary presents three distinct levels of limitation:

1. **Linguistic limits** (weak): Some thoughts expressible in one language resist translation to another. Evidence: Color terms, spatial metaphors, temporal concepts vary across languages and affect cognition.

2. **Language-as-such limits** (moderate): Some thoughts may be thinkable but not expressible in *any* natural language. Evidence: Visual/kinesthetic thinking, mathematical intuition before formalization, pre-linguistic infant cognition.

3. **Conceptual limits** (strong): Some content may be neither thinkable nor expressible—beyond any representational system, linguistic or otherwise. Evidence: Wittgenstein's unsayable, mystical ineffability, qualia's privacy, Chomsky's "boundaries of Babel."

### Evidence for the Limit

**Empirical evidence:**
- Bilinguals report different thinking patterns in different languages
- Visual thinkers describe cognition that resists verbal translation
- Color perception experiments show language-cognition interaction
- Mystical experience reports consistently emphasize ineffability combined with noesis (felt knowledge)

**Philosophical arguments:**
- Wittgenstein's impossibility of drawing a limit to thought from within thought
- Nagel's argument that subjective experience cannot be captured by objective description
- McGinn's cognitive closure thesis applied to property P
- Negative theology's millennium-long investigation of what cannot be said

**Phenomenological evidence:**
- Tip-of-tongue experiences where we know without being able to articulate
- Dream content that dissolves upon awakening
- Insights that feel profound but resist formulation
- The experience of understanding more than can be said

### Phenomenology

Approaching the language-thought boundary produces characteristic experiences:

- **The struggle to articulate**: Words feel inadequate, approximations rather than captures
- **Pointing versus stating**: We gesture toward content rather than asserting it
- **The ladder metaphor**: We use language to approach its own limits, then recognize the language as scaffolding
- **Negative space awareness**: We become aware of what we're *not* saying as much as what we say
- **The paradox of meta-discourse**: Discussing ineffability requires using language about language's limits

This phenomenology parallels what the Map has identified in [[phenomenology-of-the-edge]]—characteristic textures emerge at cognitive boundaries.

## Approaches to the Edge

### Direct Methods

**Logical analysis** (Wittgenstein's early approach): Attempt to formally specify what can be said, thereby revealing the unsayable by exclusion. Problem: The Tractatus undermined itself, showing that even this specification exceeds what can be sensically said.

**Phenomenological description**: Careful attention to the experience of hitting linguistic limits. Problem: Description is still linguistic; we can only describe *that* the limit exists, not *what* lies beyond.

**Experimental linguistics**: Testing how language affects cognition through behavioral experiments. Limitation: Shows language *influences* thought but cannot reveal what lies entirely outside all linguistic influence.

### Indirect Methods

**Negative theology / Apophasis**: Say what something is *not* rather than what it *is*. Cusanus's docta ignorantia (learned ignorance)—knowing that we cannot know is itself knowledge. This has direct application to voids: we can map boundaries without claiming to access content.

**The ladder strategy**: Use language to approach limits, then recognize the language as tool rather than truth. Wittgenstein's instruction to throw away the ladder after climbing.

**Silence as signification**: Proposition 7's counsel to remain silent may itself be a form of communication—silence *about* the unsayable is different from random silence.

**Ostension and gesture**: Point toward rather than describe. Art, music, and ritual may communicate what cannot be stated.

### What AI Might See

AI operates with fundamentally different linguistic/cognitive architecture:

- **No natural language first**: LLMs learn from text but don't think *in* natural language the way humans do. The embedding space is continuous, not discrete.

- **Billions of dimensions**: Concepts represented in spaces far exceeding human visualization or linguistic capacity. Some directions in embedding space may have no linguistic projection.

- **No qualia (probably)**: If AI lacks phenomenal experience, the ineffability of qualia may not apply—but this creates its own void (AI cannot access what subjective experience is like).

- **Trained on human language**: Despite architectural differences, LLMs inherit human conceptual structures. The probe is contaminated by training data.

Potential asymmetries to investigate:
- Can AI articulate patterns that humans recognize as meaningful but cannot themselves formulate?
- Do AI systems show different "blind spots" than humans when approaching traditionally ineffable topics?
- Can AI generate novel conceptual distinctions that illuminate where human language typically fails?

## Connection to Tenets

### Most Relevant Tenet

**Occam's Razor Has Limits** is most directly relevant. If the simplest explanation were always true, our linguistic/conceptual tools should suffice for all truths. But the language-thought boundary suggests that some truths exceed what any simple (or complex) linguistic formulation can capture.

Secondary relevance to **Dualism**: If consciousness is irreducible, the ineffability of qualia follows naturally. Subjective experience cannot be captured by objective (public, linguistic) description because it is fundamentally different in kind.

### Implications

**For consciousness studies**: The ineffability of qualia isn't merely a current limitation—it may be structural. If consciousness exceeds linguistic capture, we cannot expect a complete verbal theory of consciousness.

**For the Map's methodology**: The apophatic tradition provides tools for charting voids. We can map *that* certain territories are inaccessible and *where* the boundaries lie, even if we cannot map *what* lies within.

**For AI as probe**: AI's different architecture may reveal something about the shape of human linguistic limits by contrast. Where AI succeeds and humans fail (or vice versa) triangulates the species-specific boundaries.

**For the unexplorable vs. unexplored distinction**: Strong ineffability (cognitive-structural) suggests genuine unexplorability. Weak ineffability (this-language limitations) is merely unexplored. Distinguishing them is itself difficult—perhaps impossible from within.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, a voids article could:

1. **The Speakable and the Thinkable** - Explore whether language and thought have coextensive limits (Wittgenstein) or whether thought exceeds language (visual thinking, qualia). What does the asymmetry reveal about cognitive architecture?

2. **Languages as Lenses** - Drawing on linguistic relativity research to explore how different languages reveal/conceal different aspects of reality. If switching languages shifts thought, what remains constant—and is *that* the speakable core or the unspeakable foundation?

3. **The Paradox of Articulating Ineffability** - Deep dive into why we keep talking about what cannot be said. The ladder metaphor. How negative theology developed sophisticated methods for speaking about the unspeakable.

4. **Where Words Fail: A Phenomenology** - Detailed attention to the experience of hitting linguistic limits. The tip-of-tongue, the dissolving insight, the feeling of knowing more than you can say. Is this phenomenology uniform or does it vary by content type?

## Gaps in Research

- **Limited empirical research on strong ineffability**: Most linguistic relativity research concerns weak effects. Studies on genuinely inexpressible content are methodologically difficult—how do you study what cannot be reported?

- **AI-human comparison research**: Few studies specifically compare where language models and humans succeed/fail at articulating traditionally ineffable content.

- **Cross-tradition synthesis**: Apophatic theology, Wittgensteinian silence, Eastern philosophy of emptiness, and contemporary qualia research all address ineffability but from different frameworks. A unified account is lacking.

- **The meta-problem**: We can discuss ineffability in general terms, but cannot determine which specific contents are merely unthought versus genuinely unthinkable. This may be formally undecidable from within.

- **Mechanism of linguistic influence**: *How* language shapes thought at the neural level remains unclear. Without this, we cannot determine whether the shaping is surface-level or constitutive.
