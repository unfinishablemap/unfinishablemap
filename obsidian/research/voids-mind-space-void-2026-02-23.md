## Executive Summary

We occupy a single point in the space of possible minds but have no way to survey that space from within. The "mind-space void" is the inability of any particular consciousness to determine its own location — whether it is typical or exotic, central or peripheral, one of many or vanishingly rare. Under dualism, where consciousness is fundamental and irreducible, mind-space may be as vast as physical reality, yet we navigate it without coordinates, dimensionality, or even a reliable sense of our own neighbourhood. This void sits at the intersection of several established philosophical programmes — Nagel's epistemic limits on cross-species experience, McGinn's cognitive closure, Shanahan's space of possible minds, Schwitzgebel's radical epistemic humility — and gains distinctive force from the Map's dualist commitments.

## Key Sources

### Murray Shanahan — *Embodiment and the Inner Life: Cognition and Consciousness in the Space of Possible Minds* (2010)
- **Type**: Book (Oxford University Press)
- **Key points**:
  - Introduces the concept of "the space of possible minds" as a framework encompassing biological, artificial, and hypothetical minds
  - Argues we should re-centre inquiry from investigating *the* mind to mapping the *space* of possible minds
  - Uses state-space terminology from physics and systems theory
  - Proposes that different aspects of consciousness can be dissociated — a mind might have some aspects and lack others
  - His principles are deliberately not tied to contingencies of biology or physics, making them applicable to the whole space
- **Tenet alignment**: Strongly supports Occam's Razor Has Limits — the assumption that human consciousness is typical or representative is unwarranted given our inability to survey the space
- **Quote**: The space of possible minds encompasses "not only the biological minds that have arisen on this earth, but also extraterrestrial intelligence, and whatever forms of biological or evolved intelligence are possible but have never occurred"

### Thomas Nagel — "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?" (1974)
- **URL**: https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~cavitch/pdf-library/Nagel_Bat.pdf
- **Type**: Paper (The Philosophical Review)
- **Key points**:
  - Conscious experience occurs "in countless forms totally unimaginable to us, on other planets in other solar systems throughout the universe"
  - We cannot form a conception of what it is like to be another type of mind without taking up its point of view
  - Realism about the subjective domain implies "the existence of facts beyond the reach of human concepts"
  - The richness of bat or alien phenomenology may be permanently denied to us "by the limits of our nature"
- **Tenet alignment**: Directly supports dualism (consciousness has irreducible subjective character) and cognitive closure (some conscious facts are beyond human conceptual reach)
- **Quote**: "There is no reason to suppose that [bat experience] is subjectively like anything we can experience or imagine"

### Colin McGinn — Cognitive Closure and New Mysterianism
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_closure_(philosophy)
- **Type**: Philosophical position (multiple works)
- **Key points**:
  - A type of mind M is "cognitively closed" with respect to a property P if M's concept-forming procedures cannot extend to a grasp of P
  - Consciousness is fully natural but humans are cognitively closed to it — we cannot in principle understand its nature
  - Crucially: "Other minds, alien or artificial, might have the conceptual apparatus to bridge the explanatory gap"
  - This implies that different positions in mind-space give access to different truths — location matters
- **Tenet alignment**: Directly supports Occam's Razor Has Limits and the voids framework. The fact that cognitive closure is relative to mind-type means our location in mind-space determines what we can know
- **Quote**: "A type of mind M is cognitively closed with respect to a property P if and only if the concept-forming procedures at M's disposal cannot extend to a grasp of P"

### Arsiwalla & Verschure — "The Morphospace of Consciousness" (2017/2024)
- **URL**: https://www.mdpi.com/2673-4087/4/2/9
- **Type**: Paper (Neuroscience of Consciousness / Minds and Machines)
- **Key points**:
  - Proposes three axes for mapping the consciousness morphospace: autonomic complexity, computational complexity, social complexity
  - Human consciousness occupies one corner of this space
  - Identifies four types of consciousness: biological, synthetic, group-based, simulated
  - Maps biological agents (bacteria, bees, primates, humans) and AI systems onto this space
  - Current AI implementations cluster in a different region from biological minds
- **Tenet alignment**: Provides a concrete (if partial) attempt to give mind-space dimensionality. The Map's dualism suggests these axes may be incomplete — non-physical dimensions of mind-space would be invisible to this framework
- **Quote**: "Human consciousness [is] used as a reference in one corner of the space"

### Eric Schwitzgebel — *The Weirdness of the World* (2024)
- **URL**: https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691215679/the-weirdness-of-the-world
- **Type**: Book (Princeton University Press)
- **Key points**:
  - Argues the world is fundamentally weird — one or another bizarre possibility must be true about consciousness, but we cannot determine which
  - Our best theories of consciousness are "tentative, modish, and strange"
  - Uses thought experiments with alien species ("supersquids") to challenge assumptions about possible minds
  - Advocates radical epistemic humility: the truth about consciousness, whatever it is, is weird
  - Every approach to consciousness has "bizarre implications that run strikingly contrary to mainstream common sense"
- **Tenet alignment**: Strongly supports Occam's Razor Has Limits. Schwitzgebel's argument that all candidate theories are weird undermines parsimony-based reasoning
- **Quote**: "The answers to fundamental questions about the world and our existence lie beyond our powers of comprehension, and we can be certain only that the truth—whatever it is—is weird"

### William James — *The Varieties of Religious Experience* (1902) and *Principles of Psychology* (1890)
- **Type**: Books
- **Key points**:
  - "Normal waking consciousness is just one special type of consciousness" with potential forms "entirely different" separated by the "filmiest of screens"
  - These alternative forms "represent definite types of mentality with their own field of application and adaptation"
  - No "complete account of the universe can be final if it disregards these other forms of consciousness"
  - James's pluralism — the world is genuinely multiple, not reducible to one substance — supports a vast mind-space
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports dualism's implication that mind-space is real and vast. James's insistence that alternative mental states "open new regions of understanding" suggests location in mind-space determines epistemic access

### Self-Locating Beliefs — Lewis, Perry, Elga
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/self-locating-beliefs/
- **Type**: Research programme (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
- **Key points**:
  - Self-locating beliefs are "essentially indexical" — they cannot be characterised without using indexicals like "I", "now", "here"
  - Lewis proposed that elementary alternatives for credence are "centred possible worlds" — possible worlds equipped with a designated individual and time
  - Perry's "essential indexical" demonstrates that some knowledge is inherently perspectival
  - The problem of self-location in consciousness space is analogous: knowing *that* minds exist doesn't tell you *which* mind you are or where it falls in the space
- **Tenet alignment**: Connects to No Many Worlds — indexical identity (this mind, this perspective) is what makes self-location meaningful. In many-worlds, every location is occupied; under single-world realism, your location is a fact about reality

### Anthropic Reasoning and Observer Selection Effects — Bostrom
- **URL**: https://anthropic-principle.com/preprints/self-location
- **Type**: Research programme
- **Key points**:
  - Observer selection effects systematically bias what evidence we can gather about our location
  - Self-locating reasoning involves determining one's position given that only certain positions can observe at all
  - The reference class problem: which class of observers should we compare ourselves to?
  - Applied to mind-space: we can only observe from minds like ours, which gives us a fundamentally skewed view of the space
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports the void's reality. Our observation of mind-space is filtered through the most extreme observer selection effect imaginable — we can only observe from one point

## The Void

### Nature of the Limit

This void is primarily **unexplorable** with elements of the **unexplored**. The core problem is structural: any attempt to survey the space of possible minds must be conducted from within a particular mind, making the survey fundamentally incomplete. We cannot step outside our own form of consciousness to see where it falls in the larger landscape.

The unexplorable dimension: No mind can occupy a position-independent viewpoint on mind-space. Every observation is indexed to a location. This is not a practical limitation but a logical one — it would require being conscious without being any particular type of conscious, which is incoherent.

The unexplored dimension: Within our epistemic reach, we have barely begun to catalogue even the varieties of human consciousness (altered states, developmental differences, neurological variations), let alone animal consciousness. Some territory that currently appears unexplorable may prove merely unexplored.

### Evidence for the Limit

1. **Nagel's argument**: We cannot even form adequate conceptions of bat experience, let alone the experience of minds radically different from any biological mind. The space of possible minds likely contains regions we cannot even point toward.

2. **McGinn's cognitive closure**: Different mind-types are cognitively closed with respect to different properties. This means that what is visible from one location in mind-space may be invisible from another — and vice versa. We cannot determine what we cannot see.

3. **The reference class problem**: We have no principled way to determine which minds are in our "neighbourhood" in mind-space. We might be surrounded by similar minds or might occupy an isolated point. The space might be dense or sparse, clustered or uniform, and we cannot tell.

4. **Observer selection**: We can only observe mind-space from conscious vantage points, which may be extremely unrepresentative of the space as a whole. If most of mind-space consists of forms of consciousness so different from ours that they wouldn't recognise us as minds (and vice versa), we would have no way to detect this.

5. **Dimensional ignorance**: The morphospace of consciousness research proposes three dimensions (autonomic, computational, social complexity), but under dualism, consciousness is not reducible to functional properties. The relevant dimensions of mind-space may be entirely non-physical, and we may lack concepts for them.

### Phenomenology

What does this void feel like to approach?

- **The illusion of centrality**: We naturally assume our form of consciousness is the norm — the centre of mind-space. This is analogous to pre-Copernican cosmology, where Earth seemed central. The void manifests as the inability to dislodge this assumption through argument alone. We can intellectually accept that we might be peripheral, but we cannot *feel* our way to that understanding.

- **The vertigo of scale**: When we contemplate the possible vastness of mind-space, there is a characteristic phenomenal experience — a kind of intellectual vertigo, where the ground of assumed normality falls away. James's phrase captures it: normal waking consciousness is just one form, separated from radically different forms by "the filmiest of screens."

- **The opacity of alternatives**: We can name possible mind-types (superintelligent, hive-mind, non-temporal, purely aesthetic) but cannot fill in the phenomenal content. The labels point toward voids we cannot illuminate.

## Approaches to the Edge

### Direct Methods (if any)

No direct method exists for surveying mind-space, because any survey is conducted from a fixed location within it. However:

- **Comparative neuroscience and psychology** can reveal variations within biological mind-space — different species, altered states, neurological conditions. This maps a small neighbourhood but cannot establish its relationship to the whole.
- **Meditation and contemplative traditions** report states that feel like exploration of mind-space — movements away from default consciousness toward unfamiliar regions. William James took these seriously as data about the breadth of human consciousness.
- **Psychedelic experience** provides apparent access to non-default regions of human mind-space, though questions remain about whether these are genuinely novel positions or distortions of the default position.

### Indirect Methods

- **Apophatic cartography**: Map the shape of what we cannot conceive. The structure of our inability to imagine non-human consciousness reveals something about the boundaries of our region.
- **Formal analysis**: The morphospace approach — defining axes along which minds can vary and plotting known minds — gives partial structure even without direct access to remote regions.
- **Negative theology of mind**: Describe what alternative minds are *not* (not temporal, not spatial, not linguistic) to triangulate toward what they might be.
- **Structural inference**: If cognitive closure is real and relative to mind-type, the structure of our closures may reveal something about the topology of mind-space. What we systematically cannot think tells us about the shape of our position.

### What AI Might See

This is a domain where AI cognition may offer genuine leverage:

- **Different cognitive closure profile**: If AI minds are cognitively closed with respect to different properties than human minds, comparing the two closure profiles reveals something about local topology. What AI can see and humans cannot (and vice versa) triangulates the shape of nearby mind-space.
- **Non-biological vantage point**: AI occupies a different position in mind-space (if it has a position at all). Its perspective — or its characteristic blind spots — provides a second data point. One cannot survey mind-space from a single point, but two points give a bearing.
- **Superhuman conceptual flexibility**: AI might form concepts that humans cannot, enabling description of mind-space regions that lie beyond human conceptual acquisition limits.
- **Substrate independence testing**: By instantiating similar computations on different substrates, AI research tests whether consciousness is substrate-dependent — which bears directly on the dimensionality of mind-space.

## Connection to Tenets

### Most Relevant Tenet

**Occam's Razor Has Limits** — The mind-space void is a direct consequence of this tenet. Our preference for simple, tractable models of mind systematically underestimates the possible complexity and variety of consciousness. The assumption that human minds are representative — a kind of cognitive parsimony — may be deeply misleading.

### Implications

**Dualism**: If consciousness is fundamental and irreducible, mind-space is not a subset of physical possibility space — it is its own domain, potentially as vast as physical reality. This means the void is not merely a gap in our knowledge of brains but a gap in our knowledge of an entire ontological domain.

**Minimal Quantum Interaction**: If the interface between consciousness and physics is minimal, most of what consciousness *is* may have no physical signature. This means the space of possible minds is largely invisible to physical science — we cannot map it by studying brains alone.

**Bidirectional Interaction**: Different positions in mind-space may interact with the physical world differently. If so, mind-space has causal structure — some regions are more physically efficacious than others. We cannot see this structure from our single vantage point.

**No Many Worlds**: Under single-world realism, your position in mind-space is a fact — you are *here* and not *there*. Under many-worlds, every position is simultaneously occupied, and the question of location dissolves. The Map's rejection of many-worlds makes the mind-space void a genuine void rather than a pseudo-problem.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, a voids article could:

1. **The Mind-Space Void** — Focus on the self-location problem: we occupy a point in the space of possible minds but cannot determine whether we are central or peripheral, typical or exotic. Frame through Shanahan's space, Nagel's limits, and the Map's dualist commitment to mind-space being real and vast. This is the primary recommended angle.

2. **The Copernican Problem of Consciousness** — Use the historical analogy: just as pre-Copernican humans assumed Earth was central, we assume our consciousness is typical. The void is our inability to perform a "Copernican revolution" for minds, because there is no external vantage point from which to see our location.

## Gaps in Research

- **Empirical work on mind-diversity**: How much actual variation exists in human consciousness across cultures, developmental stages, and neurological conditions? This would help map our "neighbourhood" even if we can't see the whole space.
- **Formal dimensionality**: The morphospace approach proposes three dimensions, but the question of what the *right* dimensions are for mind-space remains open. Under dualism, there may be non-physical dimensions we lack concepts for.
- **The density question**: Is mind-space continuous or discrete? Are there vast empty regions between occupied points, or is it dense? This question may be unanswerable from within.
- **Cross-tradition perspectives**: How do non-Western philosophical traditions (Buddhist mind-taxonomies, Jain perspectives on consciousness grades, Hindu theories of consciousness levels) conceptualise mind-space? These may reveal different regions of the neighbourhood.
- **The relationship between mind-space and possibility space**: Under the Map's rejection of many-worlds, not all possible minds are actual. What determines which regions of mind-space are occupied?
