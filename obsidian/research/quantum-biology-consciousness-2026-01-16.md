## Quantum Biology Overview

Quantum biology investigates non-trivial quantum effects in biological systems. While classical physics governs most biological processes, several phenomena appear to require quantum mechanical explanations. This research explores the major examples and their implications for the project's framework.

## Established Quantum Biological Effects

### 1. Photosynthesis and Energy Transfer

The Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex in green sulfur bacteria sparked the quantum biology revolution:

- **Fleming et al. (2007)**: First observed quantum coherence in photosynthetic energy transfer
- **Energy transfer efficiency**: Near-unity quantum efficiency in initial photon capture
- **Mechanism**: Superpositions enable simultaneous sampling of multiple energy pathways

**Recent reassessment (2020-2025)**:
- Duan et al. found electronic coherence lifetime of ~60 femtoseconds at room temperature
- Long-lived oscillations now attributed to vibrational modes rather than electronic coherence
- Current consensus: quantum coherence probably doesn't enhance photosynthetic efficiency

**Key insight**: Even in this favorable system, decoherence is faster than initially hoped. But photosynthesis doesn't require consciousness-like selection—it just needs efficient energy transfer. The relevance to consciousness is as proof-of-concept that quantum effects can operate in biological systems.

### 2. Avian Magnetoreception

Migratory birds detect Earth's magnetic field through the radical pair mechanism in cryptochrome proteins:

- **Mechanism**: Light triggers electron transfer in cryptochrome-4a, creating radical pairs
- **Quantum feature**: Singlet-triplet interconversion depends on external magnetic field
- **Coherence time**: Spin coherence persists for microseconds (μs)
- **Precision**: Birds detect magnetic field direction to better than 5°
- **Key cryptochrome**: Cry4, expressed at constant levels (necessary for navigation)

**January 2026 Princeton breakthrough** (published in JACS):
- Computational simulations confirmed the radical pair mechanism
- Identified electron transfer pathway (>18 angstroms from flavin to final radical pair)
- Showed how protein reorganisation stabilises the radical pair for magnetic sensing

**Significance for site's framework**: This is the strongest evidence that evolution can optimise quantum effects for biological function. If quantum coherence serves navigation, the claim that it cannot serve consciousness requires explanation.

### 3. Enzyme Quantum Tunneling

Quantum tunneling explains how enzymes catalyse reactions faster than classical models predict:

**The catalysis problem**:
- Many biochemical reactions should require millions of years uncatalysed
- Enzymes accelerate reactions by 10¹²–10¹⁷ times
- Classical transition state theory cannot fully explain these rates

**Tunneling mechanism**:
- Protons, hydrogen atoms, and electrons don't follow classical "over-the-barrier" pathways
- Instead, they tunnel through energy barriers
- The small mass of hydrogen facilitates quantum mechanical penetration
- Kinetic isotope effects (H vs D) provide experimental evidence

**Key examples**:
- Soybean lipoxygenase-1 shows large kinetic isotope effects
- Aromatic amine dehydrogenase shows complex pressure/temperature dependence
- QM/MM simulations now provide quantitative predictions matching experiment

**Protein dynamics connection**:
- Quantum tunneling coupled to enzyme dynamics in flavoproteins and quinoproteins
- Thermodynamically equilibrated motions control H-donor/acceptor distance
- Creates conformational ensemble suitable for H-tunneling

**2025 advances**:
- September 2025 study in Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics: quantum dynamics in Ni+-mediated C–H activation
- Integration of quantum and classical mechanics revolutionising computational enzymology

### 4. Quantum Olfaction (Controversial)

Luca Turin's vibration theory of olfaction proposes that smell detection involves quantum tunneling:

**The theory**:
- Odorant molecules fit into receptor binding sites (shape recognition)
- Then molecular vibrations are detected via inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS)
- Different vibrational frequencies produce different smells
- "Swipe card" model vs. pure "lock and key" shape theory

**Evidence and controversy**:
- Biophysical simulations (Physical Review Letters, 2006) suggest mechanism is physically viable
- Deuterium experiments show discrimination between isotopes in some cases
- Block et al. (PNAS, 2015) argued electron transfer mechanism could be suppressed by quantum effects of non-odorant vibrational modes
- Experimental proof complicated by trace contaminant issues

**2024 developments**:
- Deep learning analysis of 3018 molecular vibrational spectra
- Systematic validation supports vibrational theory predictions
- Suggests both shape and vibration may contribute

**Current status**: Unsolved question whether recognition is by shape, vibration, or combination. More experimental work needed.

## Quantum Effects in the Brain

### Orch OR Theory (Penrose-Hameroff)

The orchestrated objective reduction theory proposes quantum computation in neural microtubules:

- **Location**: Microtubules within neurons
- **Mechanism**: Quantum vibrations are "orchestrated" by synaptic inputs
- **Collapse**: Penrose objective reduction terminates quantum computation
- **Consciousness**: Emerges from orchestrated collapses

**2025 experimental support** (Neuroscience of Consciousness, Oxford Academic):
- Room-temperature quantum effects observed in microtubules
- Direct MRI evidence of macroscopic quantum state correlated with consciousness
- Anesthetics disrupt entangled collective quantum state of many neural microtubules
- Explains why anesthetic effect is specific to consciousness

### QBIT Theory (2025)

A newer competing theory proposes spintronic coherence:

- **Mechanism**: Microtubules as nanoscale spintronic oscillators with memristive properties
- **Location**: Axon initial segment (AIS) provides unique conditions
- **Advantage**: Spintronic coherence more stable at physiological temperatures than electronic or vibrational coherence
- **Claim**: Spontaneous coherence emergence is necessary and sufficient for generating qualia

**Key difference from Orch OR**: QBIT argues spintronic properties allow coherence to persist longer in warm, noisy brain environment.

### Macroscopic Quantum Effects (2025)

Frontiers in Human Neuroscience (2025) reported new insights into macroscopic quantum effects in the brain:

- Evidence challenges the "warm, wet, and noisy" objection
- Warm quantum coherence demonstrated in:
  - Plant photosynthesis
  - Bird brain navigation
  - Olfaction
  - Brain microtubules

## Implications for the project's Framework

### Strengthening the Minimal Quantum Interaction Tenet

1. **Biological precedent**: Avian magnetoreception proves evolution can harness quantum coherence for function. Dismissing neural quantum effects as impossible requires explaining why navigation succeeds but consciousness cannot.

2. **Enzyme tunneling analogy**: If enzymes routinely use quantum tunneling to accelerate reactions by factors of 10¹⁷, the claim that quantum effects cannot influence neural processing is weakened.

3. **Decoherence is not the end**: Even when coherence is short-lived (as in photosynthesis), quantum effects can still be functional. the project's framework requires only that consciousness bias outcomes at measurement—not that it maintain long-lived superpositions.

### The Measurement Problem Remains Open

All quantum biological effects ultimately involve the measurement problem:

- Photosynthesis: Which pathway does the exciton take?
- Magnetoreception: Which spin state is measured?
- Enzyme catalysis: Does the particle tunnel or not?

In each case, physics provides probabilities but not definite outcomes. The role for consciousness at this point remains conceptually open.

### What Quantum Biology Does NOT Show

1. **Proof of consciousness causing collapse**: None of these biological examples require consciousness. They work fine with standard quantum mechanics.

2. **Long-lived neural coherence**: The jury is still out on whether coherence persists long enough for neural computation.

3. **Specific mechanism for consciousness**: Neither Orch OR nor QBIT has been definitively confirmed.

### What Quantum Biology DOES Show

1. **Quantum effects operate in warm, wet biology**: The "warm, wet, and noisy" objection is less decisive than critics claimed.

2. **Evolution optimises quantum effects**: Natural selection can harness quantum phenomena for biological advantage.

3. **The measurement problem is biologically relevant**: Every quantum biological effect involves outcome selection that standard physics leaves undetermined.
