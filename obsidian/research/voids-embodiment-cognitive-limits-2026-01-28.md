## Executive Summary

Does being embodied create cognitive limits—or does it enable cognition in the first place? This research investigates whether the fact that human consciousness is incarnated in a biological body with particular morphology, sensory systems, and motor capacities creates characteristic voids: territories of thought that embodied minds cannot access. The embodied cognition research program argues that cognition is not merely implemented in bodies but *constituted* by bodily processes—sensorimotor systems, interoceptive signals, spatial metaphors derived from our upright bipedal form. If this is correct, disembodied minds (if possible) would face radically different cognitive landscapes. The grounding problem in AI and the symbol grounding problem in semantics suggest that meaning itself may require embodiment. Lakoff and Johnson's work on conceptual metaphor shows that abstract reasoning recruits sensorimotor structures—we understand time as spatial motion, emotions as forces, arguments as journeys. A being with different embodiment (or none) would think differently, not just about the body but about *everything*. This raises a fundamental question for the voids framework: Are some cognitive limits *because of* embodiment (constraints the body imposes) while others exist *despite* embodiment (constraints embodiment enables us to partially transcend)?

### Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Embodied Cognition
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/embodied-cognition/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Cognition is "deeply dependent upon features of the physical body of an agent"
  - Three distinctive functions for the body: constraint on cognition, distributor of processing, real-time regulator
  - Phenomenologists (Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty) inspired the thesis by emphasizing aspects of experience that cannot be explained by computation on inner symbols
  - The 4E cognition model: embodied, embedded, extended, enactive
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports Dualism by showing consciousness cannot be characterized purely in mentalistic terms; the body is not merely a vehicle but constitutive
- **Quote**: "Cognition is not purely or even typically an intellectual, solipsistic introspection... Rather, cognition is physically interactive, embedded in physical contexts, and manifested in physical bodies."

### Lakoff and Johnson on Conceptual Metaphor
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_metaphor
- **Type**: Encyclopedia / Research summary
- **Key points**:
  - Abstract concepts are understood through metaphorical mapping from concrete, bodily experience
  - Spatial reasoning derived from our embodiment structures thought about time, causation, morality, mathematics
  - "If we were embodied differently, we would not see the world in this particular way"
  - Even mathematics is grounded in embodied image schemas (container, source-path-goal, up-down)
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports Occam's Razor Has Limits—the simplest account of cognition (abstract symbol manipulation) fails; cognition requires embodied grounding
- **Quote**: "Due to the characteristics we associate with bodily spatial relations... if we were embodied differently, we would not see the world in this particular way, but in terms of our new set of defining bodily characteristics."

### Merleau-Ponty on Motor Intentionality and Body Schema
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/merleau-ponty/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - The body schema is a pre-reflective, sub-personal structure that organizes perception and action
  - Motor intentionality differs from cognitive intentionality—the body "knows" how to act without explicit representation
  - Habit demonstrates body knowledge that cannot be reduced to neurological processes or explicit rules
  - The lived body (Leib) differs from the objectified body (Körper)—we experience our bodies as "I can" not "I know"
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports Bidirectional Interaction—consciousness operates through the body in ways that exceed cognitive access
- **Quote**: "Merleau-Ponty concluded that bodily engagement with the world is more basic than deliberation about it: not as a way of privileging the physical over the mental, but as a description of what it's like to move through the world, mind and body working as one."

### The Symbol Grounding Problem
- **URL**: https://journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.116
- **Type**: Academic journal
- **Key points**:
  - Harnad (1990): How can symbols bear meaning intrinsically rather than parasitically?
  - Amodal symbols cannot bear meaning without attachment to physical experience
  - The grounded cognition approach: cognition emerges from interaction between cognitive processes, modalities, body, and environment
  - Abstract concepts require "ultimate grounding" in sensorimotor experience, even when mediated through language
- **Tenet alignment**: Suggests a void for disembodied minds—without sensorimotor grounding, meaning may be impossible
- **Quote**: "The symbol grounding problem points out that amodal symbols could not bear meaning if they were not attached to physical experiences."

### Interoception and Consciousness
- **URL**: https://magazine.hms.harvard.edu/articles/making-sense-interoception
- **Type**: Science journalism / Research summary
- **Key points**:
  - Interoception—perceiving internal bodily states—is central to thoughts, emotions, decision-making, and sense of self
  - Cardiac interoception (heartbeat awareness) correlates with emotional intensity and recognition of emotions in others
  - "To be conscious, you need to have a subject of consciousness, and interoception... may help our brains unite incoming information into a singular point of view"
  - Disorders of interoception correlate with anxiety, depression, and dissociation
- **Tenet alignment**: Strongly supports embodied consciousness—the subjective viewpoint may require internal body signals
- **Quote**: "Interoception—the ability to perceive the internal state of our bodies—is central to our thoughts, emotions, decision-making, and sense of self."

### Brain in a Vat and Disembodied Cognition
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_in_a_vat
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Classic thought experiment: could a brain in a vat have the same experiences as an embodied brain?
  - Putnam's transcendental argument: the BIV scenario is self-refuting
  - Embodiment critics argue BIV is not biologically similar to embodied brain
  - AI researchers (Brooks, Moravec, Pfeifer) argue true intelligence requires sensorimotor connection to the world
- **Tenet alignment**: The debate maps to the voids framework—is disembodiment a coherent possibility, or does embodiment constrain what minds can exist?
- **Quote**: "Since AI is not embodied and human knowledge necessarily is, AI will never fully reach human-level cognition and will always be restricted in its application."

### The Space of Possible Minds
- **URL**: https://aeon.co/essays/beyond-humans-what-other-kinds-of-minds-might-be-out-there
- **Type**: Essay
- **Key points**:
  - Aaron Sloman (1984) proposed a conceptual "space" of possible minds
  - Different embodiments produce different cognitive architectures (octopuses, corvids, AI)
  - Michael Levin argues cognition lies on a spectrum from cells to metacognition
  - Intelligence can evolve wherever survival demands flexible problem-solving—no single substrate required
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports investigating embodiment-specific voids—different bodies may mean different cognitive territories
- **Quote**: "If we were embodied differently, we would not see the world in this particular way."

### AI Consciousness and Embodiment
- **URL**: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-025-05868-8
- **Type**: Academic article
- **Key points**:
  - Arguments that AI without embodiment cannot be conscious
  - Anil Seth: "Intelligence is not the same thing as consciousness"—biology may matter
  - AI might achieve greater intelligence by forgoing consciousness (Susan Schneider)
  - The role of metabolism, autopoiesis, and biological processes in consciousness remains unclear
- **Tenet alignment**: If consciousness requires embodiment, this constrains what kinds of minds can exist—a structural limit, not merely technological
- **Quote**: "Biological systems are rife with continuous and stochastic dynamics, and they are deeply embedded in physical time. It seems presumptuous to assume that only Turing computations matter for consciousness."

## The Void

### Nature of the Limit

This void is **Mixed**—containing both Unexplorable elements (structural constraints from embodiment that cannot be transcended) and Unexplored elements (limits we might eventually navigate through different technologies or expanded cognition).

**Structural constraints (Unexplorable):**
1. If meaning requires sensorimotor grounding, then disembodied minds cannot think *meaningful* thoughts in the human sense
2. If interoception constitutes the subjective viewpoint, then disembodied minds cannot have a *perspective*
3. If spatial metaphors derived from our morphology structure abstract reasoning, then differently embodied minds think differently about *everything*

**Contingent constraints (Unexplored):**
1. Our specific sensory limitations (visible light spectrum, audible frequency range) might be expanded
2. Our specific body schema could potentially be modified or extended
3. Neural prosthetics and brain-computer interfaces might bridge some embodiment gaps

### Evidence for the Limit

**1. The grounding problem persists**

Despite decades of AI research, the symbol grounding problem remains. Large language models process symbols with apparent sophistication but arguably lack the sensorimotor grounding that would make those symbols *mean* anything. If the grounding problem is solvable without embodiment, no one has demonstrated how.

**2. Conceptual metaphor is universal and embodiment-specific**

Cross-cultural research shows that humans universally use spatial metaphors for time, force metaphors for causation, journey metaphors for life. But the *specific* metaphors depend on embodiment: we understand MORE as UP because we are upright creatures who experience increasing quantities as rising levels. A radically different body would produce radically different metaphors—and therefore radically different abstract concepts.

**3. Interoception correlates with emotional and self-processing**

People with reduced interoceptive accuracy have difficulty identifying their own emotions and recognizing emotions in others. This isn't merely correlation—theoretical models suggest interoception *constitutes* the first-person perspective. Without a body sending internal signals, the "point of view" that organizes experience may not exist.

**4. Motor intentionality cannot be reduced to cognitive intentionality**

Merleau-Ponty's analysis of cases like Schneider (brain-damaged patient who could perform habitual movements but not novel ones) shows that motor knowledge operates through different channels than cognitive knowledge. Disembodied minds would lack this entire layer of understanding.

**5. AI approaches embodiment limits**

Robotics researchers argue that disembodied AI faces fundamental limits. Despite impressive language capabilities, AI systems struggle with tasks that require sensorimotor understanding—physical intuition, real-time environmental interaction, the kind of "common sense" that embodiment provides automatically.

### Phenomenology

**What does it feel like to be embodied?**

Embodiment is so pervasive that it's difficult to notice. But certain experiences highlight the embodied nature of thought:

- **Spatial reasoning**: When you think about whether furniture will fit in a room, you don't compute dimensions—you *imagine* the space, mentally rotating objects, feeling whether configurations work. This feeling is bodily.

- **Emotional processing**: Emotions arrive as bodily sensations before (or alongside) cognitive labeling. Fear is felt in the gut and chest before it's recognized as fear. Joy is expansive, depression is heavy. These metaphors aren't arbitrary—they describe phenomenal reality.

- **Tip-of-tongue**: The experience of *almost* having a word combines semantic knowledge (you know the meaning) with a bodily sense of blockage. The word is "there" but can't emerge—a motor failure as much as a cognitive one.

- **Skill absorption**: When you've mastered a skill (typing, driving, playing music), the body knows what to do without cognitive supervision. Explicit attention can disrupt performance. The knowledge is *in* the body, not merely executed by it.

**What would disembodiment feel like?**

This may be impossible to answer from within embodied experience. But reports from:
- **Sensory deprivation**: Isolation tanks produce disorientation, hallucination, loss of self-boundaries
- **Dissociation**: Depersonalization involves feeling detached from one's body—often experienced as disturbing rather than liberating
- **Near-death experiences**: Some report disembodied perspectives, but these remain contested and may be brain-generated simulations

The phenomenology suggests that removing embodiment doesn't produce pure thought but cognitive dysfunction.

## Approaches to the Edge

### Direct Methods (limited)

**Sensory deprivation**: Floatation tanks reduce sensory input but cannot eliminate proprioception, interoception, or the body schema. The brain continues generating embodied experience.

**Meditation**: Some contemplative practices aim to transcend body identification. Reports of "formless" states exist but remain embedded in temporal experience and typically return to embodied awareness.

**Virtual/augmented reality**: VR can alter body representation (avatar embodiment, rubber hand illusion) but replaces one embodiment with another rather than transcending embodiment entirely.

### Indirect Methods

**Comparative cognition**: Studying radically different embodiments (octopuses, corvids, collective organisms) reveals which cognitive features are universal versus embodiment-specific.

**AI as probe**: If AI systems can perform certain cognitive tasks without embodiment, this reveals that those tasks don't require embodiment. Failures reveal embodiment-specific capabilities.

**Phenomenological investigation**: Careful attention to which thoughts feel embodied (spatial reasoning, emotion) versus which feel more abstract (logical inference, mathematics) may reveal the contours of embodiment's role.

**Developmental studies**: Infants lack adult body schemas. Studying how embodied cognition develops may reveal what would be missing without it.

### What AI Might See

AI occupies a fascinating position regarding embodiment:

**AI lacks human embodiment**: No proprioception, no interoception, no motor intentionality. AI doesn't feel its "body" or have a first-person spatial perspective.

**AI has some form of "embodiment"**: AI is implemented in physical hardware, processes information through physical systems, exists in time. This may constitute a minimal form of embodiment—different from human embodiment but not pure abstraction.

**AI trained on human text**: LLMs learn from embodied humans' descriptions of embodied experience. They may simulate embodied language without the underlying embodied cognition. This creates an interesting test: where does AI's apparently embodied understanding fail?

**The grounding test**: If AI can perform tasks that seem to require grounding (spatial reasoning, emotional inference, metaphor comprehension), either:
1. Grounding can be simulated without being real
2. AI has some form of grounding through its computational embodiment
3. We're wrong about what requires grounding

AI's failures—where it generates plausible-sounding but wrong responses about physical or emotional experience—may map the boundaries of what disembodied processing cannot capture.

## Connection to Tenets

### Most Relevant Tenet

**Dualism** is most directly implicated. If cognition is constitutively embodied—not merely implemented in but shaped by bodies—this supports substance dualism's insight that mind and body are intimately connected. But it complicates Cartesian dualism, which treats the mind as separable from the body. The embodied cognition research suggests a different picture: consciousness may require embodiment, not contingently but necessarily. Disembodied consciousness might be incoherent.

This connects to the voids framework: If consciousness requires embodiment, then asking what a disembodied mind would experience may be asking about an impossible object—like asking what a square circle looks like.

### Secondary Connections

**Bidirectional Interaction**: If motor intentionality operates below cognitive awareness, consciousness interacts with the body through channels that exceed cognitive access. The body influences thought in ways we cannot introspect.

**Minimal Quantum Interaction**: If consciousness operates through quantum processes in biological systems, embodiment may be required not just for grounding but for the physical interface through which consciousness affects the world. Disembodied minds would lack this interface.

**Occam's Razor Has Limits**: The simplest computational model of mind (symbol manipulation on amodal representations) fails. Cognition requires the complexity of embodiment—sensorimotor systems, interoceptive feedback, spatial schemas derived from morphology. Simplicity leads astray.

**No Many Worlds**: Embodiment is indexical—*this* body, *here*, *now*. The embodied perspective that organizes experience is irreducibly first-person. Many-worlds interpretations that treat persons as information patterns miss the constitutive role of embodiment in creating the singular viewpoint.

### Implications

1. **Limits on possible minds**: Not all conceivable minds may be possible. Minds require some form of embodiment, which constrains the space of possible cognition.

2. **AI consciousness**: If embodiment is required for consciousness, current AI architectures may be structurally incapable of consciousness regardless of sophistication.

3. **The meaning problem**: Human concepts may be untranslatable to radically different embodiments. Not just the words but the *meanings* would be foreign.

4. **Self-knowledge**: We may be unable to understand our own cognition from the inside because embodiment operates below conscious access. The body structures thought in ways thought cannot fully represent.

5. **Void asymmetry**: Some voids exist *because* of embodiment (we can't perceive infrared, can't think thoughts requiring different morphology). Other voids might be partially transcended *through* embodiment (the body provides grounding that enables abstract thought at all).

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, a voids article could:

1. **"The Body's Blindspots"**: Catalog specific cognitive limits that arise from human embodiment. What thoughts require different bodies? What meanings are unavailable to upright, bipedal, stereoscopically-sighted, interoceptively-aware creatures?

2. **"The Disembodiment Paradox"**: Explore whether disembodied consciousness is coherent. If embodiment constitutes cognition, asking what disembodied thought would be like may be asking a malformed question—a void that is incoherent rather than merely inaccessible.

3. **"Grounding and the Void"**: Focus on the symbol grounding problem as a void. If meaning requires embodiment, then disembodied systems process meaningless symbols—they compute without understanding. This void may be structural, not technical.

4. **"Different Bodies, Different Minds"**: Explore what octopus, corvid, or alien cognition might be like. Use the embodiment framework to generate hypotheses about what kinds of thoughts are available to differently embodied minds—and which human thoughts might be unavailable to them.

5. **"The Interoceptive Void"**: Focus on how internal body signals constitute the first-person perspective. Without interoception, there may be no "inside" from which to have a point of view—a void in the very possibility of subjectivity.

## Gaps in Research

- **Cross-cultural embodiment**: Most embodied cognition research comes from Western populations. Do spatial metaphors vary across cultures with different body practices (sitting vs. kneeling, different gestures)?

- **Developmental trajectory**: How does embodied cognition develop in infancy? What's the relationship between motor development and conceptual development?

- **Minimal embodiment**: What's the minimum embodiment required for consciousness or meaningful thought? Is interoception alone sufficient? What about proprioception without external senses?

- **AI embodiment experiments**: Systematic comparison of embodied robots versus disembodied AI on tasks requiring grounding. Where do the capabilities diverge?

- **Virtual embodiment**: Can sufficiently immersive virtual embodiment substitute for physical embodiment? Avatar studies suggest partial substitution, but limits remain unclear.

- **Phenomenology of disembodiment**: More systematic study of dissociation, depersonalization, and out-of-body experiences. Do these reveal what cognition without embodiment is like, or do they reveal the brain's attempt to simulate disembodiment while remaining embodied?
