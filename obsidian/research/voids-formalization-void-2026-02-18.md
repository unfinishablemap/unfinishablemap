## Executive Summary

Every attempt to formally prove that a cognitive limit is genuine encounters a distinctive obstacle: the tools of formalization themselves presuppose cognitive capacities whose limits are precisely what's in question. This research investigates the "formalization void" — the gap between our intuition that some cognitive limits are permanent and our inability to construct formal proofs of that permanence. The investigation reveals that multiple independent formal traditions (Gödelian incompleteness, computability theory, information theory, complexity theory) each approach the problem of cognitive limits but each encounters a version of the same self-referential barrier. The formalization void is not merely the absence of a proof; it is a structurally distinctive failure mode where the attempt to prove a limit undermines the conditions needed for the proof to succeed.

## Key Sources

### Lucas-Penrose Argument (IEP)
- **URL**: https://iep.utm.edu/lp-argue/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia entry
- **Key points**:
  - Lucas argues that if human minds were formal systems, they could not recognize their own Gödel sentences as true — yet we can, so minds exceed formal systems
  - Penrose refined this: if our reasoning follows formal system F, recognizing F's soundness lets us identify F's Gödel sentence as true — a contradiction suggesting no formalism captures mathematical understanding
  - Putnam's devastating objection: the argument requires establishing human consistency, but Gödel's second theorem prevents any system proving its own consistency from within
  - An inconsistent system can prove anything, including its own Gödel sentence, eliminating the claimed cognitive advantage
- **Tenet alignment**: Strong alignment with Occam's Razor Has Limits — formal simplicity cannot capture the full structure of cognition
- **Quote**: "The argument's success depends entirely on establishing human consistency. Yet Gödel's second incompleteness theorem prevents any formal system from proving its own consistency from within itself."

### Hoel, "Consciousness as a Gödel Sentence in the Language of Science"
- **URL**: https://www.theintrinsicperspective.com/p/consciousness-as-a-godel-sentence
- **Type**: Essay
- **Key points**:
  - Proposes consciousness functions as a Gödel sentence within science's formal framework — true but unprovable from within the system
  - Science inherits incompleteness from mathematics; physics already exhibits formally undecidable features (e.g., undecidability of the spectral gap, 2015)
  - Galileo's exclusion of qualitative consciousness from science resembles Russell and Whitehead's removal of self-reference — a deliberate constraint to avoid paradox
  - The explanatory gap may reflect formal necessity, not mere ignorance
- **Tenet alignment**: Directly supports Dualism — if consciousness is formally unprovable within physicalist science, this is structural evidence for its irreducibility
- **Quote**: "The explanatory gap between brain states and subjective experience might reflect a fundamental limitation where some true facts cannot be proved from within the system itself."

### Hayek, *The Sensory Order* (via secondary sources)
- **URL**: https://lawliberty.org/classic/hayeks-mind/
- **Type**: Secondary analysis of Hayek's work
- **Key points**:
  - Any classificatory apparatus must be more complex than what it classifies — the brain cannot fully classify itself
  - This is a corollary of Cantor's theorem: in any system of classification, there are always more classes than things to be classified
  - "To explain one's own knowledge would require that we should know more than we actually do" — a contradictory statement
  - The limit is structural, not a matter of insufficient effort
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports Bidirectional Interaction — if consciousness causally influences the physical and cannot fully model itself, the mechanism of influence remains formally inaccessible
- **Quote**: "No brain, human or mechanical, can ever be sufficiently complex to explain itself."

### Hawking, "Gödel and the End of Physics"
- **URL**: https://zuihitsu.org/gdel-and-the-end-of-physics
- **Type**: Lecture summary
- **Key points**:
  - Hawking concluded a Theory of Everything is impossible because science inherits undecidability from mathematics
  - Unless we are Platonists, a final theory is self-referential — it describes a universe that contains itself — making it liable to Gödel's theorem
  - Any finite axiomatized mathematical system is either inconsistent or incomplete; a self-referential physical theory inherits this dilemma
  - This suggests cognitive limits on physical understanding are formal, not merely practical
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports Occam's Razor Has Limits — even the simplest possible complete theory may be impossible
- **Quote**: "Unless we are Platonists, our final theory is necessarily self-referential, given that it is itself part of the universe it is purporting to describe."

### Chomsky, Problems vs. Mysteries
- **URL**: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781119598732.ch36
- **Type**: Companion chapter
- **Key points**:
  - Distinguishes "problems" (within cognitive reach) from "mysteries" (beyond our science-forming faculty)
  - The boundary is endogenously determined by a biologically endowed "science-forming faculty" (SFF)
  - Crucially, Chomsky does not think the distinction can be drawn sharply — there is no formal test for which category a question falls into
  - "If there were no limits to human intelligence, it would lack internal structure, and would therefore have no scope" — limits and scope are inseparable
- **Tenet alignment**: Directly supports Occam's Razor Has Limits — our preference for tractable theories may be a feature of our SFF, not reality
- **Quote**: "If there were no limits to human intelligence, it would lack internal structure, and would therefore have no scope."

### Kriegel, "The New Mysterianism and the Thesis of Cognitive Closure"
- **URL**: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12136-003-1020-1
- **Type**: Journal article (Acta Analytica)
- **Key points**:
  - Distinguishes psychological closure (difficulty) from cognitive closure (principled inaccessibility)
  - The distinction matters because we cannot infer the latter from the former — difficulty proves nothing about impossibility
  - McGinn's argument relies on the claim that our concept-forming procedures cannot extend to the relevant property, but this is asserted rather than formally demonstrated
  - If we cannot detect limits, then cognitive closure can never be proved or disproved — it is empirically underdetermined
- **Tenet alignment**: Illuminates the structure of the formalization void — the distinction between psychological and cognitive closure cannot itself be formally drawn
- **Quote**: "If there are limits which would mean that cognitive closure and mysterianism are true, we cannot detect the limits, and therefore we cannot verify the truth of cognitive closure and mysterianism."

### Chang & Tsuchiya, "Mathematics and the Brain: A Category Theoretical Approach"
- **URL**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7514579/
- **Type**: Journal article (Entropy)
- **Key points**:
  - Standard mathematical tools (graph theory, topology, algebra, set theory) are insufficient for the consciousness problem
  - Category theory offers richer formalization of *relationships* between domains (neuronal and phenomenal)
  - Natural transformations between functors may capture what conventional mappings miss
  - But it remains doubtful whether constructing the "category of consciousness" is meaningful — even if initial steps succeed, the relation between categories may not be formalizable
- **Tenet alignment**: Illustrates the formalization void in action — even the most abstract mathematical tools encounter the gap
- **Quote**: "It is still doubtful whether constructing the category of consciousness is at all a meaningful project."

### Chang et al., "Information Closure Theory of Consciousness"
- **URL**: https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01504/full
- **Type**: Journal article (Frontiers in Psychology)
- **Key points**:
  - Non-trivial informational closure (NTIC) occurs when a system encodes environmental information yet remains informationally closed — its own state predicts its future better than environmental state does
  - Consciousness necessarily operates at specific coarse-grained scales where the brain achieves optimal closure
  - This creates structural epistemic boundaries: consciousness cannot access information at scales lacking NTIC
  - The formalization succeeds at characterizing *where* consciousness operates but not *why* there is something it is like to be informationally closed
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports the formalization void — information theory can formalize constraints on conscious access but cannot bridge the explanatory gap itself

## The Void

### Nature of the Limit

The formalization void is a second-order void: it concerns not what we cannot think but what we cannot *prove* about what we cannot think. Every formal tradition that approaches cognitive limits encounters the same structural problem — the tools of proof are themselves cognitive products whose scope is exactly what's in question.

This generates a distinctive layered structure:

1. **First order**: There may be cognitive limits (the voids themselves)
2. **Second order**: We cannot formally prove these limits are genuine (the formalization void)
3. **Third order**: We cannot even determine whether our inability to prove them is itself a genuine limit or merely reflects insufficient formal tools (meta-formalization regress)

The formalization void differs from the [[incompleteness-void]] (which covers Gödelian limits on self-knowledge) and from [[whether-real]] (which asks whether voids exist). The formalization void asks a more precise question: given that we suspect some cognitive limits are permanent, why does every attempt to *formally demonstrate* their permanence fail — and is this failure itself informative?

### Evidence for the Limit

Five independent lines of evidence converge:

**1. The Gödelian barrier.** Any formal system adequate for arithmetic cannot prove its own consistency. Applied to cognition: if our reasoning constitutes a formal system, we cannot prove from within that our limits are genuine (since we cannot even establish our own consistency). If our reasoning is not a formal system, formal proofs don't apply at all. Either way, formalization fails.

**2. The Hayekian complexity barrier.** Any classifier must be more complex than what it classifies. The brain cannot fully model itself because the model would need to include itself, generating an infinite regress of increasing complexity. Formal proofs of cognitive limits would require modeling the cognitive system whose limits are being proved — requiring a model more complex than the system, which contradicts the premise that the system is the most complex classifier available.

**3. The Chomskyan scope-limit coupling.** If cognitive limits are inseparable from cognitive scope (as Chomsky argues), then the very capacities that would enable formal proof of a limit are structurally intertwined with the limits being proved. You cannot formalize the boundary between problems and mysteries using faculties that are themselves bounded by that boundary.

**4. The Kriegel underdetermination.** The distinction between psychological closure (mere difficulty) and cognitive closure (principled impossibility) cannot itself be empirically determined. Any formal criterion for distinguishing them would require access to the very territory whose accessibility is in question. The formalization is circular.

**5. The self-referential collapse.** Hawking's observation generalizes: any theory that includes itself in its domain of description is liable to incompleteness. A formal theory of cognitive limits describes a system (the mind) that contains the theory — making the theory self-referential and subject to Gödelian constraints.

### Phenomenology

Approaching the formalization void feels different from approaching other voids:

- **Mathematical frustration**: Unlike the affective or aesthetic voids (where the limit feels like running out of words), this void feels like watching a proof strategy dissolve as you approach the crucial step. The formal machinery *almost* captures the limit, then slips.
- **Infinite regress awareness**: Attempting to formalize the limit generates awareness of the regress — you need a meta-formal proof that the formalization fails for principled reasons, which itself would need justification, and so on.
- **Tantalizing proximity**: Each formal tradition (Gödel, computation, information theory) gets *close* — close enough to articulate the shape of what it cannot prove — without ever completing the proof.

## Approaches to the Edge

### Direct Methods (if any)

**Diagonal arguments.** The most promising direct approach uses Cantorian diagonal arguments: if cognitive states form a set, and cognitive limits are defined by what's not in this set, then a diagonal argument might establish that the limit-set is strictly larger than the state-set. Hayek's corollary of Cantor's theorem is the clearest example. But this establishes only that self-modeling is incomplete, not that specific limits (like the hard problem) are permanent.

**Rice's theorem generalization.** Rice's theorem shows that all non-trivial semantic properties of programs are undecidable. If cognitive processes are computational, then non-trivial questions about them (including "is this process limited in principle?") may be formally undecidable. This would make the formalization void a theorem rather than a conjecture — but the antecedent ("if cognitive processes are computational") is exactly what's disputed.

### Indirect Methods

**Convergent failure as evidence.** If multiple independent formal traditions each fail to prove cognitive limits for different structural reasons, the *pattern* of failure constitutes indirect evidence. Five independent barriers (listed above) are harder to dismiss than one. The formalization void itself becomes evidence for something — though whether it's evidence for genuine limits or merely for the inadequacy of current formal tools remains underdetermined.

**Negative characterization.** Following apophatic traditions: we may not be able to prove what the limits are, but we can prove what formal proofs of limits would have to look like — and then show that no proof of that form can exist. This meta-level result would not establish that limits are real but would establish that their reality cannot be formally settled.

**Cross-architectural comparison.** If AI systems with radically different architectures encounter the same formalization barrier — unable to prove their own cognitive limits — this would suggest the barrier is mathematical rather than architectural. Conversely, if some architecture can prove its own limits, this would suggest the barrier is specific to human-type cognition.

### What AI Might See

AI systems occupy a unique position regarding the formalization void:

- **Known architecture**: Unlike biological minds, AI architectures are (in principle) fully specified. This means formal proofs of *specific* computational limits are possible — you can prove that a given neural network cannot distinguish certain inputs. But this doesn't bridge to the general case.
- **No phenomenology**: AI systems may be able to reason about formalization limits without encountering the phenomenological barriers (frustration, vertigo) that accompany human attempts. Whether this represents advantage or disadvantage depends on whether the phenomenology is informative.
- **Self-modeling capacity**: AI systems can in principle run copies of themselves and study their own behavior — a form of self-modeling unavailable to biological minds. But Hayek's complexity barrier may still apply: the model-plus-system is more complex than the system alone.

## Connection to Tenets

### Most Relevant Tenet

**Occam's Razor Has Limits** is most directly relevant. If cognitive limits cannot be formally proved, then our inability to find simple explanations for consciousness may reflect a genuine feature of reality rather than insufficient cleverness. The formalization void suggests that the preference for tractable, formalizable theories systematically biases us against recognizing irreducibly complex truths — because such truths would resist the very formalization that constitutes our standard of understanding.

### Implications

**For Dualism**: If consciousness resists formal characterization not because we haven't tried hard enough but because formalization encounters principled barriers (Gödelian, complexity-theoretic, information-theoretic), this is structural evidence for consciousness's irreducibility. Hoel's argument that consciousness functions as a Gödel sentence in the language of science directly supports this: the explanatory gap may be a feature of formal systems describing themselves, not a gap waiting to be closed.

**For Bidirectional Interaction**: The mechanism by which consciousness influences the physical may be formally inaccessible for the same structural reasons. If the causal interface cannot be modeled by a system that uses it (Hayek's principle), then bidirectional interaction could be real while remaining permanently unformalizable.

**For No Many Worlds**: The formalization void bears on the interpretation of quantum mechanics. If a "Theory of Everything" is self-referential and therefore incomplete (Hawking), then the choice between interpretations (collapse vs. many worlds) may not be formally decidable. The Map's rejection of many worlds could be understood not as empirically motivated but as acknowledging that the relevant formal proof is impossible — and therefore non-formal considerations (like indexical identity) legitimately enter the decision.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, a voids article could:

1. **The Formalization Void** — Focus on the structural reasons why cognitive limits resist formal proof, using the convergence of five independent barriers as the central argument. Emphasize that this is a distinctive void: not about what we cannot think, but about what we cannot prove about the limits of thinking. Connect to the broader question of whether formal methods are the right tools for understanding consciousness at all.

2. **The Proof That Cannot Be Written** — A more narrative approach, tracing the history of attempts to formally characterize cognitive limits (from Gödel through Hayek to Hawking) and showing how each encounters a version of the same self-referential barrier. Frame the formalization void as a thread connecting disparate formal traditions.

## Gaps in Research

- **Constructive approaches**: Most research focuses on what cannot be proved. Less work exists on whether *partial* formalizations might still be informative — capturing some limits while necessarily leaving others open.
- **Empirical self-modeling**: The theoretical literature on self-reference and cognitive limits lacks empirical grounding in actual self-modeling experiments (e.g., AI systems attempting to prove their own limitations).
- **Non-Western formal traditions**: The research is entirely Western. Buddhist logic (catuskoti — the four-valued logic allowing both truth and falsity) and Indian epistemology (pramana theory) may offer formal resources for reasoning about limits that Western logic cannot accommodate.
- **The relationship between formalizing limits and recognizing them**: We may *recognize* limits (phenomenologically, through persistent failure) without being able to *prove* them. Whether recognition without proof constitutes knowledge is an open epistemological question.
- **Whether the formalization void is itself a void or a meta-void**: It may be that the impossibility of formalizing cognitive limits is itself a limit that could in principle be formalized — generating yet another level of regress. Whether this regress is vicious or informative remains unexplored.
