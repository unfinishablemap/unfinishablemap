## Executive Summary

Integrated Information Theory (IIT), developed by neuroscientist Giulio Tononi since 2004, proposes that consciousness is identical to integrated information (measured by phi/Φ). The theory starts from phenomenology—what experience is like—and derives physical requirements for any substrate that could support it. IIT has panpsychist implications (any system with non-zero phi has some consciousness) and has been called a form of property dualism. The theory is controversial: a 2023 letter signed by 124 scholars labeled it unfalsifiable pseudoscience, though defenders disagree. A major Templeton-funded empirical test in 2023 gave IIT a slight edge over its rival Global Neuronal Workspace Theory, but results were inconclusive. For The Unfinishable Map's tenets, IIT offers a mixed picture: it takes consciousness seriously as irreducible (aligning with Dualism) but identifies it with physical properties rather than non-physical substance.

## Key Sources

### Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy - IIT Entry
- **URL**: [iep.utm.edu](https://iep.utm.edu/integrated-information-theory-of-consciousness/)
- **Type**: Encyclopedia article
- **Key points**:
  - IIT identifies consciousness with maximally irreducible conceptual structure (MICS)
  - Five axioms: existence, composition, information, integration, exclusion
  - Phi measures integrated information; only the local maximum (MICS) is conscious
  - Rejects pure functionalism—physical substrate matters, not just function
  - Against traditional dualism but toward a form of property dualism
- **Tenet alignment**: Partially aligns with Dualism (takes consciousness seriously as irreducible) but conflicts by identifying consciousness with physical properties
- **Quote**: "IIT remains naturalistic, identifying consciousness with physical properties (like mass or charge), not separate mental substances."

### Wikipedia - IIT
- **URL**: [wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_information_theory)
- **Type**: Encyclopedia article
- **Key points**:
  - IIT 4.0 published 2023 with refined formalism
  - Tononi openly accepts panpsychist implications
  - 2023 pseudoscience controversy—124 scholars signed letter
  - 2025 Nature publication of Templeton adversarial collaboration results
- **Tenet alignment**: Neutral on quantum interaction, conflicts with substance dualism
- **Quote**: "The idea that even simple matter has some degree of consciousness is known as panpsychism. Panpsychism runs deeply counter to common sense, and many dismiss it as unscientific. Yet, Tononi openly stands by it insofar as it follows from IIT."

### IIT 4.0 Paper (PMC)
- **URL**: [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10581496/)

  - IIT 4.0 formulates phenomenal existence in physical terms
  - Introduces "the great divide of being" between consciousness and physical substrate
  - Aims to account for free will in dualist rather than panpsychist manner
  - Structure integrated information (Φ) corresponds to quantity of consciousness
- **Tenet alignment**: Interesting development—IIT 4.0 moves toward dualist framing
- **Quote**: "IIT 4.0 faces this challenge more straightforwardly by introducing 'the great divide of being' between consciousness and its physical substrate."

### Scott Aaronson's Critique
- **URL**: [scottaaronson.blog](https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=1799)
- **Type**: Blog post / critique
- **Key points**:
  - Expander graphs could have higher phi than human brains
  - Tononi accepts this implication—XOR gates in grid are conscious
  - Accuses IIT of "heads I win, tails you lose" reasoning
  - Argues theory is unfalsifiable
- **Tenet alignment**: This critique doesn't directly bear on site tenets but highlights IIT's counterintuitive implications
- **Quote**: "You can't count it as a 'success' for IIT if it predicts that the cerebellum is unconscious, while at the same time denying that it's a 'failure' for IIT if it predicts that a square mesh of XOR gates is conscious."

- **Quote**: "Three judges tasked with reviewing the experimental results concluded that IIT fared slightly better than GNWT in the agreed-upon trials."

### Stanford Encyclopedia - Neuroscience of Consciousness
- **URL**: [plato.stanford.edu](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-neuroscience/)

  - Axioms: consciousness exists, is intrinsic, specific, unitary, definite, structured
  - David Chalmers: IIT is "a development in the right direction, whether or not it is correct"
- **Tenet alignment**: Starting from phenomenology aligns with taking consciousness seriously (Dualism tenet)
- **Quote**: "These axioms, obtained by drawing on introspection and reason, are that consciousness exists, and that it is intrinsic, specific, unitary, definite, and structured."

## Major Positions

### Position 1: IIT (Tononi, Koch, et al.)
- **Proponents**: Giulio Tononi, Christof Koch, Melanie Boly
- **Core claim**: Consciousness IS integrated information; any system with non-zero phi has some consciousness; phi can be calculated from physical architecture
- **Key arguments**:
  - Starts from undeniable phenomenology (that experience exists)
  - Derives physical postulates from phenomenological axioms
  - Explains why some systems (brains) are conscious and others (feed-forward networks) aren't
  - Provides quantitative measure (phi) for degree of consciousness
- **Relation to site tenets**: Partially compatible. IIT takes consciousness seriously as fundamental (aligns with Dualism), but identifies it with physical properties rather than non-physical substance. Does not require quantum effects (conflicts with Minimal Quantum Interaction). Does not make consciousness causally efficacious in the way Bidirectional Interaction requires—consciousness IS the physical structure, not something acting on it.

### Position 2: Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT)
- **Proponents**: Stanislas Dehaene, Bernard Baars, Jean-Pierre Changeux
- **Core claim**: Consciousness arises when information is broadcast globally across a "workspace" of interconnected cortical neurons, making it available for report, memory, and action
- **Key arguments**:
  - Explains why some processes are conscious (globally broadcast) and others aren't (local)
  - Maps to specific neural architectures (prefrontal cortex involvement)
  - Better fits with functionalism—substrate doesn't matter, only information processing
- **Relation to site tenets**: Less compatible than IIT. GNWT is more functionalist/materialist. Treats consciousness as emergent from information processing rather than fundamental.

### Position 3: Critics (Aaronson, Searle, et al.)
- **Proponents**: Scott Aaronson, John Searle, 124 signatories of 2023 letter
- **Core claim**: IIT is either unfalsifiable (Aaronson) or meaningless (Searle's critique of panpsychism)
- **Key arguments**:
  - Expander graphs would be "unboundedly more conscious than humans" by IIT's math
  - IIT selectively appeals to intuition (cerebellum unconscious = success) while ignoring counterintuitive implications (XOR gates conscious)
  - Panpsychism doesn't explain anything—"consciousness" becomes too broad to be useful
  - Information is observer-relative (Searle)—can't be intrinsic to systems
- **Relation to site tenets**: The methodological critique (unfalsifiability) is neutral to tenets. Searle's observer-relativity objection would also apply to any theory treating information as fundamental.

## Key Debates

### Debate 1: Is IIT Falsifiable/Scientific?
- **Sides**:
  - IIT defenders: Theory makes testable predictions; extrapolations beyond testability are inevitable for any comprehensive theory
  - Critics (2023 letter): Core claims are unfalsifiable; until empirically testable, should be labeled pseudoscience
- **Core disagreement**: Whether IIT's predictions about systems we can't test (e.g., simple physical systems having consciousness) undermine its scientific status
- **Current state**: Ongoing. The 2023 Templeton results were inconclusive but gave IIT a slight empirical edge. More experiments underway.

### Debate 2: Does Phi Actually Measure Consciousness?
- **Sides**:
  - IIT: Phi follows necessarily from the axioms; it's not just a correlate but an identity
  - Critics: Phi is an arbitrary measure; expander graphs having high phi shows the measure is wrong
- **Core disagreement**: Whether integrated information IS consciousness or merely correlates with it in some systems
- **Current state**: No resolution. Tononi accepts counterintuitive implications; critics see this as reductio ad absurdum.

### Debate 3: Is IIT Dualist, Panpsychist, or Physicalist?
- **Sides**:
  - Some: IIT is a form of property dualism (mental properties not reduced to physical states but assigned to physical arrangements)
  - Some: IIT is panpsychist (consciousness fundamental like space/time)
  - Some: IIT is physicalist (consciousness IS certain physical properties)
- **Core disagreement**: What ontological category IIT falls into
- **Current state**: IIT 4.0 explicitly introduces "the great divide of being" and aims for dualist framing. But most still see it as panpsychist.

### Debate 4: Relation to Quantum Theories
- **Sides**:
  - IIT proponents: No need for quantum mechanics; classical physics sufficient
  - Penrose-Hameroff (Orch OR): Quantum collapse in microtubules is source of consciousness
- **Core disagreement**: Whether consciousness requires quantum effects
- **Current state**: Separate research programs. Some speculate quantum coherence might be involved in integration, but this isn't mainstream IIT.

## Connection to Site Tenets

### Dualism Tenet
IIT takes consciousness seriously as something that cannot be eliminated or explained away. This partially aligns with the Dualism tenet. However, IIT identifies consciousness WITH certain physical properties (integrated information) rather than treating it as a separate non-physical substance. This is closer to property dualism or neutral monism than substance dualism.

**Tension**: the Map's dualism is stronger—consciousness is "not reducible to physical processes." IIT says consciousness IS a physical property (like mass or charge). The Map would likely find this too reductive, even though IIT claims to take phenomenology as fundamental.

### Minimal Quantum Interaction Tenet
IIT does not require quantum effects. It works entirely at the level of classical information processing and physical architecture. This neither supports nor contradicts the Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet directly—IIT is simply silent on quantum mechanics.

**Potential integration**: One could speculate that quantum effects might be relevant to *how* integration occurs, but this isn't part of standard IIT.

### Bidirectional Interaction Tenet
This is where IIT most conflicts with the Map's tenets. IIT identifies consciousness with integrated information—it doesn't give consciousness causal powers over and above the physical. The phi-structure IS the consciousness; it doesn't causally influence the physical because it IS the physical (in a certain configuration).

**Tension**: the Map holds that "consciousness selects among superposed neural states, collapsing quantum indeterminacy." IIT has no mechanism for this. If consciousness just IS integrated information, it doesn't "do" anything—it simply exists as a property of certain physical arrangements.

### No Many Worlds Tenet
IIT is neutral on quantum interpretations. Since it doesn't rely on quantum mechanics, it doesn't take a position on Many Worlds vs. collapse theories.

### Occam's Razor Has Limits Tenet
IIT is itself an example of a theory that adds ontological complexity (panpsychism) rather than reducing consciousness to simpler physical processes. In this sense, it aligns with the tenet that simplicity isn't always the right guide.

**However**: IIT's critics would say it fails Occam's Razor by attributing consciousness to systems (expander graphs) where it seems absurd. The Map might respond that this shows the limits of intuition, not the failure of the theory.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, an article on IIT could:

1. **IIT as a Serious Competitor**: Present IIT as one of the most developed mathematical theories of consciousness, taking phenomenology seriously. Note where it aligns with site tenets (consciousness as fundamental) and where it diverges (no causal role for consciousness).

2. **The Empirical Turn**: Focus on the Templeton adversarial collaboration as a model for consciousness science. Discuss what the inconclusive results mean and what further tests might show.

3. **Critique from Site Perspective**: Argue that IIT's identification of consciousness with integrated information fails to capture what matters—the causal efficacy of consciousness. If consciousness just IS phi, it doesn't explain why we discuss qualia (the Bidirectional Interaction argument).

4. **Panpsychism as a Feature, Not a Bug**: Take IIT's panpsychism seriously as a possible truth, exploring whether simple systems might have minimal experience. This could lead into discussions of the combination problem and how micro-experiences might combine.

## Gaps in Research

- Detailed technical analysis of IIT 4.0's mathematical formalism
- How exactly IIT 4.0's "great divide of being" differs from earlier versions
- Specific responses to Aaronson's expander graph objection from IIT proponents
- Whether IIT could be modified to include causal efficacy (bridging to site tenets)
- Relationship between IIT's phi and quantum information theory
- Full results and analysis of the 2025 Nature publication on Templeton collaboration

## Suggested Follow-up Tasks

1. **P2: Write concept page on IIT** - Use this research to create a concept page explaining IIT and its relation to site tenets
2. **P3: Research combination problem** - How do micro-experiences combine into unified consciousness? Relevant to IIT's panpsychism and site's view
3. **P3: Compare consciousness theories** - IIT, GNWT, Higher-Order Theories, Orch OR—how do they stack up against site tenets?
