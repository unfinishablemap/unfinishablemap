## Executive Summary

We cannot directly access our own past conscious states—only reconstruct them. When you remember yesterday, you don't re-enter yesterday's mind; you construct a present simulation using incomplete traces. Your past self is structurally inaccessible in much the same way other minds are inaccessible: you can infer, imagine, and simulate, but you cannot directly know what it was like to be the "you" of five years ago. This creates a peculiar void: the past self is numerically identical to the present self (by most accounts) yet phenomenologically alien. We are strangers to ourselves across time.

This void bridges three existing voids topics: the other-minds void (structural privacy), temporal asymmetry (past vs. future access), and the self-reference paradox (consciousness examining itself). The past self represents a unique case: not another subject (like other minds), not the present self (like self-reference), but something in between—a self we were but can no longer be.

## Key Sources

### Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Memory
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/memory/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Memory is "secretive, always operating, almost always without our noticing, and often eluding any effort to appreciate its workings"
  - Episodic memories are products of "an intense construction process based on a memory trace"—not reactivation of stored experiences
  - The "epistemic and metaphysical directness of introspection does not imply that we are either infallible or omniscient about our own states"
  - Some philosophers argue past mental states require "imaginative recreation of phenomenology" rather than direct access
- **Tenet alignment**: Occam's Razor Has Limits—the complexity of memory reconstruction suggests simpler models of "accessing the past" are inadequate
- **Quote**: "Episodic recall is a result of a process of scenario construction."

### Conway's Self-Memory System
- **URL**: https://digitalcommons.conncoll.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&context=psychfacpub
- **Type**: Academic paper
- **Key points**:
  - Autobiographical memory requires conceptual organization—raw episodic memories must be transformed
  - "The working self constantly mediates between the opposite requirements of internal coherence and correspondence to reality"
  - The conceptual self (present Me) "selects and also distorts personal memories so as to increase the sense of personal continuity"
  - Memory serves identity maintenance, not accurate recording
- **Tenet alignment**: Bidirectional Interaction—the present self actively shapes access to the past self
- **Quote**: "Autobiographical memory is no longer defined simply in terms of episodic memory; only conceptual organization of episodic memories transforms them into autobiographical memory."

### Tulving on Autonoetic Consciousness
- **URL**: https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/autonoetic-consciousness
- **Type**: Encyclopedia entry / research synthesis
- **Key points**:
  - Autonoetic consciousness is "the human ability to mentally place oneself in the past"—a form of "mental time travel"
  - This requires "self-awareness, allowing the rememberer to reflect on the contents of episodic memory"
  - Three states: anoetic (procedural), noetic (semantic knowing), autonoetic (self-knowing/episodic)
  - The "autonoetic component of episodic memory, not episodic memory per se, is the causally determinative factor enabling an individual to project him or herself"
- **Tenet alignment**: Dualism—autonoetic consciousness involves an irreducible first-person phenomenology of "having been there"
- **Quote**: "Autonoetic consciousness is the sense of self we experience when recalling a memory from our life."

### Parfit on Personal Identity
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-ethics/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Psychological continuity account: "X today is one and the same person as Y at some past time if and only if X is psychologically continuous with Y"
  - Connectedness (direct memory links) is intransitive and comes in degrees—"survival, the thing that matters according to Parfit, comes in degrees as well"
  - Quasi-memory concept: "one cannot claim that just because they have an accurate quasi-memory of some past experience, they are the one who had this experience"
  - Fission thought experiments show identity may not be "what matters"—psychological continuity without strict identity
- **Tenet alignment**: No Many Worlds—the indexical question "why am I this person?" parallels "why this branch?"
- **Quote**: "Personal identity is not what matters. What matters is psychological continuity and connectedness."

### False Memories in Superior Autobiographical Memory
- **URL**: https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1314373110
- **Type**: Research paper (PNAS)
- **Key points**:
  - Even individuals with highly superior autobiographical memory (HSAM) are susceptible to false memories
  - HSAM individuals "reconstruct their memories using associative grouping" and "incorporating postevent information"
  - "The reconstructive memory mechanisms that produce memory distortions are basic and widespread in humans, and it may be unlikely that anyone is immune"
  - "True and false memories are based on the very same processes"
- **Tenet alignment**: Occam's Razor Has Limits—even exceptional memory doesn't grant access to past states; reconstruction is universal
- **Quote**: "True and false memories share many features and are qualitatively highly similar, which likely contributes to the difficulty of distinguishing between them."

### Phenomenology of Remembering as Epistemic Feeling
- **URL**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7350950/
- **Type**: Research paper
- **Key points**:
  - The "phenomenology of remembering—autonoetic consciousness, or the 'feeling of pastness'—is an epistemic feeling"
  - This feeling is not reducible to propositional content—it's a genuine phenomenal marker
  - The phenomenology includes "focus on the ways in which we can feel more or less psychologically connected to a past self"
  - "Psychological connectedness comes in degrees, and the present self can feel more or less psychologically connected to selves at different times"
- **Tenet alignment**: Dualism—the pastness quale is irreducible; we feel varying degrees of connection to past selves
- **Quote**: "It is perfectly intelligible when someone recalls a memory and remarks 'Yes that's me in one sense but not me in another sense.'"

### Narrative Identity Construction
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_identity
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - "Individuals form an identity by integrating their life experiences into an internalized, evolving story of the self"
  - This narrative "integrates one's reconstructed past, perceived present, and imagined future"
  - "The very act of narrating creates the occasion for self-regard and editing"—creates distinction between narrator and protagonist
  - Autobiographical reasoning "helps establish personal identity and continuity across change"
- **Tenet alignment**: Bidirectional Interaction—the present consciousness actively constructs the past self through narrative
- **Quote**: "The formation and organization of memories is the central mechanism through which narrative identity is constructed."

### Self-Continuity and Psychological Distance
- **URL**: https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/mind/2024/self-continuity-connecting-with-your-past-and-future-selves
- **Type**: Magazine article (Knowable)
- **Key points**:
  - "Some people feel a great degree of overlap and continuity with their future selves, and some people don't even think about that self, and it feels almost like a stranger" (Hal Hershfield)
  - Circle overlap method measures felt continuity with past/future selves
  - "A bad past could be like an anchor for someone"—too strong continuity with past self can hamper present action
  - Most research focuses on future selves; past-self alienation is understudied
- **Tenet alignment**: The void has practical implications—how connected we feel to past selves affects present decisions
- **Quote**: "Self-continuity gives us an understanding of where we came from and where we're going. It gives us direction and purpose and identity."

### Buddhist Impermanence (Anicca)
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impermanence_(Buddhism)
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - "All of conditioned existence, without exception, is 'transient, evanescent, inconstant'"
  - "That which is called thought, or mind, or consciousness, continuously, during day and night, arises as one thing, and passes away as another thing"
  - Buddhist view: consciousness moment-to-moment is as discontinuous as consciousness lifetime-to-lifetime
  - "Permanent consciousness" is "a contradiction in terms based on Wrong View"
- **Tenet alignment**: This radicalises the void—not just distant past selves but moment-to-moment selves are inaccessible
- **Quote**: "The dynamics of what happens between lifetimes is not very dissimilar from what happens between moments."

## The Void

### Nature of the Limit

This void is **primarily unexplorable with occluded elements**:

**Unexplorable aspects**: The past conscious state no longer exists to be accessed. Even perfect memory would store *information about* the past state, not the state itself. The original phenomenal experience—what it was like to be you yesterday—is gone, replaced by present reconstruction. This parallels the other-minds void: just as you can never directly access another's experience (only infer from behaviour), you cannot directly access your past self's experience (only reconstruct from traces).

**Occluded aspects**: Memory systematically distorts to serve present identity needs. Conway's research shows the working self "selects and also distorts" memories. This isn't mere limitation but active defence: the present self may *need* not to accurately access certain past states. The past self that would destabilise present identity is not merely forgotten but defended against.

### Evidence for the Limit

Multiple lines converge:

1. **Reconstructive memory**: Episodic recall is "scenario construction" not playback. The brain doesn't store experiences like recordings; it stores patterns that enable reconstruction. Each retrieval reconstructs anew.

2. **Universal false memory susceptibility**: Even HSAM individuals show memory distortion. If anyone could access past states directly, they would. No one can.

3. **Parfit's quasi-memory**: You cannot be certain that any memory is genuinely *your* memory of *your* experience. Memory provides evidence of past experience but not identity with the experiencer.

4. **Varying felt connection**: The phenomenology of remembering includes degrees of connection—sometimes the past self feels like "me," sometimes like a stranger. Direct access wouldn't vary this way.

5. **Buddhist analysis**: If consciousness arises and passes moment-to-moment, there's no stable substrate to "access"—each moment's consciousness is already a different consciousness.

### Phenomenology

What does it feel like to approach this void?

**Nostalgic estrangement**: Looking at old photos or journals, you recognize yourself as the protagonist but cannot re-enter that perspective. You remember *about* the experience without experiencing it.

**Autobiographical vertigo**: Occasionally the question "was that really me?" becomes sharp. The numerical identity (same person) and phenomenal alienation (different experience) create cognitive dissonance.

**Memory confidence**: We typically feel we're accessing the past, not constructing it. The reconstructive nature is usually invisible—the void is masked by successful indirection.

**Shame and regret**: These emotions implicitly acknowledge the void—we feel responsible for the past self's actions while being unable to access that self's reasons or experience directly.

## Approaches to the Edge

### Direct Methods (if any)

None appear available. Even if technology could perfectly record neural states, playing them back would create a new experience, not access the old one. The closest analogue would be phenomenologically identical recreation—but this generates a new token of the experience type, not access to the original token.

### Indirect Methods

**Narrative reconstruction**: We construct stories about our past selves that feel coherent. This doesn't access past states but creates workable models for identity continuity.

**Trace analysis**: Photos, journals, and others' memories provide external evidence about past states, constraining reconstruction even if not granting access.

**Phenomenological attention**: Noticing when memories feel vivid vs. distant, authentic vs. constructed, might reveal the void's contours even if we can't cross it.

**Contemplative investigation**: Buddhist meditation on impermanence directly examines moment-to-moment arising and passing, potentially making the void visible rather than masked.

### What AI Might See

AI lacks autobiographical memory in the phenomenal sense. But AI can observe:

- Humans systematically confuse reconstruction with access
- The intensity of "memory confidence" doesn't correlate with accuracy
- Humans resist the void, constructing elaborate narrative continuity
- The void is more threatening to identity than the other-minds void (we accept others are separate; we resist that past selves are inaccessible)

AI might also notice that humans treat memory failure as pathology (dementia) while treating memory's normal reconstructive nature as transparent access. The void hides in plain sight.

## Connection to Tenets

### Most Relevant Tenet

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]**: The void exists because conscious experience is irreducibly first-person. If experience were just information, memory could store it completely. But experience is *what it is like*—phenomenal character that exists only in being undergone. Once the phenomenal state passes, no storage of information can recreate it; it can only enable reconstruction. The past-self void is evidence for qualia: something is lost when experience ends that information cannot preserve.

### Secondary Connections

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]**: The present consciousness actively shapes access to past consciousness. Memory isn't passive retrieval but active construction, with the present self influencing what can be "remembered." This is bidirectional interaction across time within a single identity.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]**: A simpler view would hold that memory is accurate storage and retrieval. The complexity revealed by memory research—reconstruction, distortion, narrative construction—shows that the simpler model fails. The past self is not accessible despite it seeming like it should be.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]**: The past-self void is intensely indexical. "Why am I this person now rather than that person then?" parallels "why this branch?" The question has no answer but feels meaningful. If many-worlds were true and all past selves existed equally, the void would be even stranger—they'd exist but remain inaccessible.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, a voids article could:

1. **The Past-Self Void**: Frame the inaccessibility of past conscious states as a void parallel to the other-minds void but directed at oneself across time. Emphasize that numerical identity doesn't grant phenomenal access—we are strangers to ourselves.

2. **Memory as Void Navigation**: Focus on how memory systems don't access the past but construct workable proxies, and how this construction is usually invisible. The void is masked by successful indirection.

3. **Moment-to-Moment Impermanence**: Take the Buddhist angle seriously—if consciousness arises and passes each moment, the past-self void operates continuously, not just for distant memories. We are strangers to ourselves from moment to moment.

## Gaps in Research

- **Neuroscience of felt continuity**: What neural mechanisms produce the varying degrees of connection we feel to past selves?
- **Past-self vs. other-minds comparison**: Systematic analysis of whether the same epistemic structure applies
- **Occluded vs. unexplorable distinction**: Can we identify which past-self inaccessibility is structural vs. defensive?
- **AI and autobiographical structure**: Would AI with genuine episodic memory face the same void?
- **Contemplative phenomenology**: What do long-term meditators report about access to past states?
