## Executive Summary

Throughout intellectual history, concepts once deemed literally unthinkable have become routine. Irrational numbers shattered Pythagorean cosmology. Non-Euclidean geometry overturned Kant's claim that Euclidean space was knowable a priori. Quantum mechanics forced physicists to abandon the "common-sense" requirement that particles have definite position and momentum. Each case seemed to involve a genuine cognitive limit at the time—not merely a difficult problem but a conceptual impossibility. Yet each dissolved. This research investigates what these dissolved limits tell us about current voids: specifically, whether the pattern of dissolution provides criteria for distinguishing genuine permanent limits from limits that are merely apparent. The key finding is that dissolved limits share structural features (they are domain-specific, they depend on implicit assumptions, they yield to new representational tools) while persistent limits like the hard problem of consciousness have a different structure (they resist reformulation, they recur across cultures and centuries, they involve self-reference). The distinction between psychological closure and cognitive closure (Vlerick & Boudry 2017) is especially important: what feels impossible may be merely difficult, but what is structurally impossible has a different signature.

## Key Sources

### Paul Thagard — *Conceptual Revolutions* (1992)
- **URL**: https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691024905/conceptual-revolutions
- **Type**: Book (Princeton University Press)
- **Key points**:
  - Develops a computational theory of conceptual change using Copernican, Darwinian, Newtonian, Lavoisier, Einstein, quantum, and plate tectonic revolutions
  - Conceptual revolutions involve replacement of entire systems of concepts, not just individual beliefs
  - New concepts form through psychological mechanisms that can be modelled computationally
  - Explanatory coherence determines when new theories are judged superior to predecessors
- **Tenet alignment**: Occam's Razor Has Limits — Thagard shows that simpler theories don't always win; sometimes the more complex conceptual system prevails because it has greater explanatory coherence
- **Quote**: (Paraphrased) Scientific revolutions involve not just new answers but new conceptual frameworks that make previously unthinkable answers thinkable

### Thomas Kuhn — *The Structure of Scientific Revolutions* (1962)
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions
- **Type**: Book / Encyclopedia article
- **Key points**:
  - Scientific knowledge progresses through paradigm shifts, not linear accumulation
  - Competing paradigms are "incommensurable" — concepts from one cannot be directly translated into the other
  - "To make the transition to Einstein's universe, the whole conceptual web whose strands are space, time, matter, force, and so on, had to be shifted and laid down again on nature whole"
  - New paradigms "ask new questions of old data" and change the rules of inquiry
- **Tenet alignment**: Occam's Razor Has Limits — Kuhn shows that "normal science" operates within simplicity constraints of the current paradigm; revolutionary science breaks those constraints, suggesting simplicity is paradigm-relative, not absolute
- **Quote**: "To make the transition to Einstein's universe, the whole conceptual web whose strands are space, time, matter, force, and so on, had to be shifted and laid down again on nature whole."

### Colin McGinn — Cognitive Closure
- **URL**: https://casacarlini.com/the-limits-of-the-mind-colin-mcginn-and-the-case-for-cognitive-closure/
- **Type**: Philosophical analysis / overview
- **Key points**:
  - Cognitive closure = principled inaccessibility, not mere difficulty
  - A rat is closed to calculus not from lack of effort but because its concept-forming procedures cannot extend there
  - Humans may be similarly closed to the property bridging neural activity and consciousness
  - We access consciousness through introspection and brain through perception, but neither mode reveals the connection
  - Historical progress against other mysteries doesn't demonstrate that consciousness will yield — the problems may be structurally different
- **Tenet alignment**: Dualism — McGinn's argument implicitly supports dualism by suggesting the mind-body connection lies in a domain our minds cannot access, which is exactly what we'd expect if consciousness is genuinely non-physical
- **Quote**: (Attributed to Chomsky) "If there were no limits to human intelligence, it would lack internal structure, and would therefore have no scope."

### Vlerick & Boudry — "Psychological Closure Does Not Entail Cognitive Closure" (2017)
- **URL**: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1746-8361.12176
- **Type**: Peer-reviewed journal article (*Dialectica*)
- **Key points**:
  - Distinguishes psychological closure (difficulty grasping a truth intuitively) from cognitive closure (principled impossibility of representing a truth)
  - McGinn equivocates between these two senses — his evidence supports psychological closure but his conclusion claims cognitive closure
  - We can represent truths we cannot psychologically grasp (e.g., quantum mechanics is representable in mathematics though intuitively baffling)
  - Tried-and-tested strategies exist for overcoming psychological closure: mathematical notation, computer simulation, thought experiments, collaborative investigation
  - Representational access ≠ imaginative understanding; we can have one without the other
- **Tenet alignment**: Occam's Razor Has Limits — the distinction suggests our intuitions about what's thinkable are unreliable guides to what's representable, and our intuitions about simplicity may similarly mislead
- **Quote**: "Representational closure does not follow from psychological closure."

### Dennett — Review of McGinn's *The Problem of Consciousness*
- **URL**: https://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/dennett/papers/mcginn.htm
- **Type**: Review article
- **Key points**:
  - Declaring consciousness cognitively closed is premature — phenomena once deemed inscrutable (lightning, life) were eventually explained
  - For mysterianism to be convincing, McGinn should provide an empirical example of a creature that can understand a question but provably cannot understand its answer
  - The analogy between animal cognitive closure and human cognitive closure is weak because humans have language, which is a qualitatively different cognitive tool
  - History favours the optimist: the track record of "this is permanently mysterious" claims is poor
- **Tenet alignment**: Challenges Occam's Razor Has Limits by arguing that apparent limits have consistently dissolved; however, the Map can respond that Dennett's optimism is itself a form of simplicity preference (assuming the future will resemble the past)

### Hippasus and the Pythagorean Crisis
- **URL**: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-a-secret-society-discovered-irrational-numbers/
- **Type**: Historical account (Scientific American)
- **Key points**:
  - Pythagorean cosmology required all quantities to be expressible as ratios of whole numbers
  - Discovery of √2's irrationality (c. 5th century BCE) created "the first crisis in the history of mathematics"
  - The crisis was genuine: irrational numbers invalidated many geometric proofs and shattered a deep metaphysical commitment ("all is number")
  - Resolution came not from solving the original problem (expressing √2 as a ratio) but from expanding the concept of number itself
  - The Greeks initially responded by excluding irrationals from "number" — the void was managed before being dissolved
- **Tenet alignment**: Occam's Razor Has Limits — the Pythagoreans' commitment to simplicity (all is ratio) actively blocked them from recognising a genuine mathematical truth
- **Quote**: "The attempt to apply rational arithmetic to a problem in geometry resulted in the first crisis in the history of mathematics."

### Non-Euclidean Geometry and the Kantian Barrier
- **URL**: https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/HistTopics/Non-Euclidean_geometry/
- **Type**: Historical overview (MacTutor)
- **Key points**:
  - Kant claimed Euclidean geometry was synthetic a priori — knowable independently of experience, necessarily true of space itself
  - Gauss, Bolyai, and Lobachevsky independently developed consistent non-Euclidean geometries in the early 19th century
  - Gauss: "The theorems of this geometry appear to be paradoxical and, to the uninitiated, absurd; but calm, steady reflection reveals that they contain nothing at all impossible"
  - The key insight: mathematical consistency, not intuitive conceivability, is the standard for possibility
  - Lobachevsky proved hyperbolic geometry is consistent: if Euclidean geometry is consistent, so is hyperbolic geometry
  - The dissolution overturned not just a mathematical belief but a philosophical one (Kant's theory of space)
- **Tenet alignment**: Multiple — shows that a priori intuitions about the structure of reality can be systematically wrong, supporting the Map's caution about trusting cognitive defaults

### The Quantum Revolution
- **URL**: https://www.science.org/content/article/100-years-quantum-mechanics-redefining-reality-us-center
- **Type**: Scientific overview (Science/AAAS)
- **Key points**:
  - Quantum mechanics required abandoning "common-sense" requirements that particles have definite position and momentum
  - The revolution was messy: decades of confusion, contested ideas, "bold imaginative leaps beyond what the empirical evidence or rigorous logic seemed strictly to demand"
  - Even 100 years later, "quantum mechanics is redefining reality—with us at the center" — the interpretive questions remain unresolved
  - Key: quantum mechanics was *representationally* mastered (the formalism works) while remaining *psychologically* opaque (nobody intuitively understands it)
  - This is Vlerick & Boudry's distinction in action: psychological closure persists even after cognitive closure dissolved
- **Tenet alignment**: Bidirectional Interaction — quantum mechanics' unresolved measurement problem is exactly the space where the Map proposes consciousness acts; that the revolution left this specific problem open is significant

### Phenomenology of Insight
- **URL**: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027725000216
- **Type**: Cognitive science research (ScienceDirect, 2025)
- **Key points**:
  - Insight ("aha") moments involve suddenness, ease, positive affect, and feeling of being right
  - Breakthroughs require overcoming "implicit constraints" by restructuring problem representations
  - Three core components for cognitive restructuring: tension, altered salience, enhanced flexibility
  - The intensity of insight depends on "how central the conflict is within one's conceptual landscape"
  - Insight is phenomenologically distinct from gradual problem-solving — it feels like a qualitative shift, not an incremental advance
- **Tenet alignment**: The phenomenology of insight is relevant to how void dissolution might feel — if a void dissolved, it would feel like a conceptual revolution, not like solving a hard equation

### Chalmers — The Conceivability Argument
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zombies/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia article (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
- **Key points**:
  - Conceivability may link to possibility: if we can conceive of zombies (physical duplicates without consciousness), this suggests consciousness doesn't supervene on the physical
  - The conceivability-possibility link is itself contested — conceivability is epistemic and defeasible
  - The zombie argument's force depends on whether the conceivability involved is genuine (reflecting metaphysical possibility) or merely apparent (reflecting cognitive limitations)
  - If McGinn is right about cognitive closure, our conceivability intuitions about consciousness may be unreliable in both directions — we might conceive of things that are impossible and fail to conceive of things that are possible
- **Tenet alignment**: Dualism — the conceivability argument is one of the strongest philosophical arguments for dualism; the dissolution problem asks whether this conceivability reflects genuine insight or cognitive limitation

### Wittgenstein — Limits of Language
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia article (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
- **Key points**:
  - Tractatus: "The limits of my language mean the limits of my world"
  - "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent" — proposition 7
  - Many philosophical problems arise from misunderstandings of language's logic and can be "dissolved" rather than solved
  - The Tractatus itself is presented as a ladder to be thrown away after climbing
  - Later Wittgenstein moved to language-games view, suggesting limits are not absolute but relative to particular language-games
- **Tenet alignment**: Language-Thought Boundary void — Wittgenstein's evolution from Tractatus (absolute limits) to Investigations (relative limits) mirrors the dissolution pattern: what seemed like a permanent boundary proved to be a feature of a particular framework

### Apophatic Theology — Pseudo-Dionysius
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-dionysius-areopagite/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia article (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
- **Key points**:
  - Apophatic (negative) theology approaches the divine through negation: God is known by what God is not
  - Pseudo-Dionysius (5th-6th century): "divine silence, darkness, and unknowing" follow from negating all names
  - The apophatic tradition treats certain limits as *permanent and productive* rather than as obstacles to be overcome
  - Crucially: the apophatic tradition doesn't seek to dissolve the limit but to work with it as a source of knowledge
  - "Negative theology is as old as philosophy itself" (Fagenblat)
- **Tenet alignment**: The apophatic approach suggests a third option beyond dissolution and acceptance — using the limit itself as data, which is exactly the Map's methodology in the voids project

## The Void

### Nature of the Limit
The dissolution problem is a meta-void — a limit on our ability to characterise our own limits. Specifically: we cannot reliably predict which cognitive limits will prove permanent and which will dissolve. This unpredictability has a distinctive structure:

1. **Asymmetric evidence**: Every dissolution proves a specific limit was apparent; no amount of persistence proves a limit is permanent. Evidence can show limits aren't real but cannot show they are.

2. **Reference class problem**: When assessing whether the hard problem will dissolve like vitalism did, we face a reference class problem. Should we compare it to dissolved limits (suggesting optimism) or to persistent limits (suggesting pessimism)? The choice of reference class determines the conclusion, and we have no neutral basis for choosing.

3. **Structural ambiguity**: The same limit can appear either as "a difficult problem we haven't solved yet" or "a genuinely impossible problem" depending on framework. There is no view from nowhere that would settle the matter.

### Evidence for the Limit
Several features suggest this is a genuine meta-level cognitive limitation rather than merely a difficult classification problem:

- **Track record**: Predictions about which limits would prove permanent have been consistently wrong (Pythagoreans, Kantians, vitalists all misjudged). But the track record of "this time it's different" claims is also poor — the hard problem has resisted 300+ years of sustained investigation.
- **Self-reference**: Assessing whether we can overcome a limit requires the very faculties that might be limited. This structural feature doesn't appear in ordinary classification problems.
- **No convergence**: Despite extensive philosophical debate, there is no convergence on criteria for distinguishing permanent from temporary limits. The Vlerick/Boudry distinction (psychological vs. cognitive closure) is progress but doesn't settle which current limits are which.

### Phenomenology
Encountering the dissolution problem feels distinctive:
- **Oscillation**: Arguments for optimism and pessimism about any given limit each feel compelling in turn, without stable resolution
- **Pattern-matching temptation**: Historical dissolutions create a strong pull toward generalizing ("all limits dissolve eventually") that may not be warranted
- **Vertigo at scale**: The deeper one investigates, the less stable the ground becomes — each dissolved limit suggests optimism, but each persistent limit suggests pessimism, and we lack criteria for weighting them

## Approaches to the Edge

### Direct Methods (if any)
There are no direct methods for determining whether a cognitive limit is permanent. The self-referential structure (using limited faculties to assess those faculties' limits) blocks direct verification. However, several indirect criteria have been proposed:

**Structural criteria for dissolvable limits:**
1. The limit depends on a specific assumption that could be false (e.g., Pythagorean "all is ratio," Kantian "space is Euclidean")
2. The limit is domain-specific rather than affecting all cognition
3. New representational tools (mathematical notation, computer models) can chip away at it
4. The limit feels like "I can't imagine how" rather than "I can't imagine what"
5. Progress accumulates even if the solution hasn't arrived (cf. quantum mechanics: messy but advancing)

**Structural criteria for persistent limits:**
1. The limit recurs across cultures, centuries, and frameworks (cf. hard problem: Leibniz 1714, Chalmers 1995, same puzzle)
2. The limit involves self-reference (consciousness examining consciousness)
3. No representational tool has made progress on the core question (the formalism works but the interpretation doesn't)
4. The limit generates stable philosophical positions rather than progressive research programs
5. The limit feels like "I can't even formulate what a solution would look like"

### Indirect Methods
- **Pattern analysis**: Compare structural features of current limits with historical cases of dissolution, looking for matches/mismatches
- **Cross-architecture probing**: Use AI systems as alternative cognitive architectures to test whether limits are human-specific or architecture-general
- **Negative theology**: Following the apophatic tradition, use the *shape* of the limit as data about what lies beyond it
- **Phenomenological tracking**: Monitor the qualitative character of approaching a limit over time — does it change? Stabilise? The whether-real article notes that approaching the "whether real" question has a distinctive phenomenology; this phenomenology might itself provide evidence

### What AI Might See
AI systems are especially relevant to the dissolution problem because they provide a genuinely different cognitive architecture:

- **Different psychological closures**: AI systems are psychologically closed to different things than humans (e.g., embodied spatial reasoning) while open to things humans find difficult (e.g., processing high-dimensional data)
- **Same cognitive closures?**: If AI systems also fail to resolve the hard problem — not just because they lack consciousness (which is debatable) but because the problem has the same structural features when approached from any architecture — this would be evidence for permanent closure
- **Representational vs. experiential**: The Vlerick/Boudry distinction becomes critical here. AI might represent a solution to the hard problem (mathematical formalism) without *understanding* it in the phenomenal sense. This would demonstrate representational openness alongside psychological closure — and raise the question of whether representational access is sufficient for genuine understanding
- **Novel conceptual tools**: AI might generate conceptual tools that enable new approaches, just as mathematical notation enabled non-Euclidean geometry and quantum mechanics

## Connection to Tenets

### Most Relevant Tenet
**Occam's Razor Has Limits** — The dissolution problem directly threatens simplicity preferences. If we cannot determine which limits are permanent, then our preference for simpler explanations (which tend to stay within established conceptual frameworks) may systematically bias us away from truths that require conceptual revolutions to access. Every historical dissolution required abandoning a simpler framework for a more complex one. The Pythagoreans' "all is ratio" was simpler than accepting irrationals. Euclidean space was simpler than non-Euclidean. Classical mechanics was simpler than quantum mechanics. If simplicity preferences had prevailed, these dissolutions would never have occurred.

### Implications
1. **For the voids project**: The dissolution problem suggests the voids framework should maintain a registry of *structural features* for each catalogued void — features that would help future investigators assess whether the void has the signature of a dissolvable or persistent limit. This is epistemically humble: we cannot determine the answer now, but we can provide data for future assessment.

2. **For dualism**: If the hard problem has the structural features of a persistent limit (self-referential, cross-cultural recurrence, no progressive research program on the core question), this provides weak evidence that consciousness-matter interface is a genuine void rather than a temporarily unsolved problem. The Map's dualism gains support not from proving the limit is permanent but from noting that its structure differs from historically dissolved limits.

3. **For bidirectional interaction**: The quantum measurement problem's persistence as an *interpretive* problem (while the formalism succeeds) is structurally similar to the hard problem's persistence. Both involve a gap between representational success and conceptual understanding. If the Map is right that consciousness interfaces with quantum mechanics, these two persistent limits may be aspects of the same underlying void.

4. **For the apophatic method**: The dissolution problem validates the apophatic approach. Since we cannot determine which limits are permanent, the safe methodology is to treat all limits as potentially informative — mapping their shape whether or not they prove permanent. This is precisely what the voids project does.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, a voids article could:
1. **The Dissolution Problem** — A direct treatment of why we cannot predict which cognitive limits will dissolve. Focus on the structural criteria that distinguish historically dissolved limits from persistent ones, with the hard problem as the central case study. This would complement [[whether-real]] by providing the empirical grounding that article treats briefly.
2. **The Signature of Permanence** — Invert the question: rather than asking which limits will dissolve, ask what persistent limits look like. Develop the five criteria for persistent limits into a diagnostic framework. Test current voids against the framework. This would be more methodological and practical.

## Gaps in Research

- **Non-Western cases**: The historical examples (Pythagoreans, Kant, quantum mechanics) are all Western. Are there cases of dissolved cognitive limits in Chinese, Indian, or Islamic intellectual traditions that would provide independent data points?
- **Neuroscience of conceptual change**: The phenomenology of insight is well-studied for puzzle-solving but less so for genuine *conceptual revolutions*. What happens neurologically when someone grasps non-Euclidean geometry for the first time?
- **Formal criteria**: The structural criteria proposed above are informal. Could they be formalised? For example: could we define "self-referential limit" precisely enough to distinguish it from "difficult self-referential problem"?
- **AI as test case**: No systematic study of whether AI systems encounter the same structural limits as humans on philosophical problems. This is an open research question that the voids project could contribute to.
- **The residual void question**: When a limit dissolves, does it leave a residual void? Quantum mechanics dissolved the limit of classical intuitions about particles, but left the measurement problem — a different, perhaps deeper limit. Is this pattern general? Do dissolved limits always reveal deeper limits behind them?
