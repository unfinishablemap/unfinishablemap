## Executive Summary

Consciousness appears to flow continuously—the "stream" of experience—yet neuroscience reveals that conscious percepts emerge in discrete episodes of approximately 400 milliseconds, separated by intervals of unconscious processing. The question of whether consciousness is genuinely continuous or fundamentally discrete has been debated for over 1,500 years (since Augustine) and remains unresolved. Recent philosophical work by Andrew Y. Lee demonstrates that introspection cannot distinguish between continuous and discrete phenomenal structure: a discrete experience can feel perfectly smooth. This irresolvability constitutes a void—not merely a gap in our current knowledge, but a structural limitation on what first-person or third-person investigation can determine about the temporal grain of experience.

## Key Sources

### Andrew Y. Lee, "Consciousness & Continuity" (University of Toronto)
- **URL**: https://philarchive.org/archive/LEECAC-14
- **Type**: Academic paper
- **Key points**:
  - Uses formal tools to clarify what it means for experience to be continuous vs. discrete
  - Develops a discrete model of the phenomenal characters of smooth experiences
  - Argues that introspection leaves open whether smooth experiences are continuous or discrete
  - "Discrete experiences can be smooth"—the intuitive assumption that smoothness entails continuity is wrong
  - The fact that an experience is discretely structured does not entail that it will strike its subject as discretely structured
- **Tenet alignment**: Occam's Razor Has Limits—our intuitive preference for continuity (the simpler model matching experience) may be wrong
- **Quote**: "What it's like to imagine an experience as discrete need not be what it's like to actually undergo the discrete experience that is imagined."

### "Time Slices: What Is the Duration of a Percept?" (PLOS Biology, 2016)
- **URL**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4829156/
- **Type**: Scientific review article
- **Key points**:
  - Proposes a two-stage model: continuous unconscious processing precedes discrete conscious percepts
  - Unconscious integration lasts up to 400 milliseconds before a percept becomes conscious
  - Feature fusion experiments show that stimuli presented in rapid succession fuse into single percepts
  - The colour phi phenomenon demonstrates post-dictive perception—impossible under purely continuous models
  - Temporal reversals in perception contradict simple continuity theories
- **Tenet alignment**: Bidirectional Interaction—if consciousness emerges in discrete moments from continuous processing, what determines the moment of "rendering" into awareness?
- **Quote**: "You need to process information continuously, but you cannot perceive it continuously."

### Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "Temporal Consciousness"
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-temporal/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia article
- **Key points**:
  - Identifies three competing models: Cinematic (discrete snapshots), Retentional (momentary with memory), Extensional (genuinely extended)
  - The cinematic model: experiences are static, motion-free "stills" in rapid succession, analogous to movies
  - The retentional model (Husserl): momentary episodes with complex structure—primal impression, retention, protention
  - The extensional model (Dainton, Russell): consciousness is genuinely extended through time
  - No consensus after decades of debate
  - The specious present has no agreed duration (300ms to 1.5 seconds)
- **Tenet alignment**: Occam's Razor Has Limits—three fundamentally different models are all compatible with the evidence
- **Quote**: "The main general theories...make no attempt to explain...experienced succession, at most they can explain experienced simultaneity."

### Buddhist Momentariness (Kṣaṇavāda)
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abhidharma/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia / philosophical tradition
- **Key points**:
  - Atomises phenomena temporally into a succession of discrete momentary entities (dharmas)
  - Each dharma "passes out of existence as soon as it has originated"
  - Continuity is explained as a continuum (santāna) of causally connected momentary entities of nearly the same nature
  - Different schools disagreed on what is momentary: Sautrantikas said only mental phenomena; Theravadins said material phenomena endure 16-17 consciousness moments
  - Sophisticated 2,000-year-old tradition addressing exactly this void
- **Tenet alignment**: Dualism—Buddhist analysis treats consciousness as having its own temporal structure independent of material processes
- **Quote**: "As an entity vanishes, it gives rise to a new entity of almost the same nature which originates immediately afterwards."

### Henri Bergson, Duration (La Durée)
- **URL**: https://philosophynow.org/issues/48/Henri_Bergson_and_the_Perception_of_Time
- **Type**: Philosophical tradition
- **Key points**:
  - Duration is the continuous, indivisible, heterogeneous flow of subjective time
  - Fiercely opposed viewing consciousness in discrete, quantifiable terms
  - Clock time is an intellectual abstraction imposed on experience—"absolutely distinct from true duration"
  - We experience time as continuous flow, not a succession of separate states
  - Bergson's critique: spatial metaphors for time (including "moments") falsify temporal experience
- **Tenet alignment**: Dualism—Bergson's durée is irreducible to physical time and measurement
- **Quote**: "Time, thought of as a homogenous medium in which our conscious states are ranged alongside one another as in space, so as to form a discrete multiplicity, is a sign, a symbol, absolutely distinct from true duration."

### Husserl, The Phenomenology of Internal Time-Consciousness
- **URL**: https://iep.utm.edu/phe-time/
- **Type**: Philosophical tradition
- **Key points**:
  - Consciousness has a tripartite structure: primal impression (now), retention (recent past), protention (immediate future)
  - The living-present is "extended like a comet's tail"—not a durationless point but not arbitrarily extended either
  - Retention is not memory but the experienced fading of the just-past
  - This structure makes consciousness temporally thick without requiring it to be either continuous or discrete in the mathematical sense
  - Husserl's model is compatible with both continuous and discrete underlying implementations
- **Tenet alignment**: Bidirectional Interaction—the protentional structure of consciousness (oriented toward the future) suggests consciousness actively shapes its temporal experience rather than passively receiving it

### "Consciousness Science Underdetermined"
- **URL**: https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ergo/12405314.0006.028/--consciousness-science-underdetermined-a-short-history?rgn=main;view=fulltext
- **Type**: Academic article
- **Key points**:
  - Scientific theories of consciousness are underdetermined by evidence
  - Theories can be preserved "come what may" in front of seemingly disconfirming evidence
  - No consensus on whether consciousness overflows reportability or on its physical basis
  - The continuous/discrete question exemplifies this broader underdetermination problem
- **Tenet alignment**: Occam's Razor Has Limits—multiple incompatible theories all survive the evidence

## The Void

### Nature of the Limit

This is primarily an **Unexplorable** void with elements of the **Occluded**. The continuity question resists resolution from multiple angles simultaneously:

**First-person barrier**: Introspection cannot distinguish continuous from discrete experience. Andrew Y. Lee's formal argument shows that discrete experiences can feel smooth—the phenomenology of continuity is compatible with underlying discreteness. You cannot introspect the grain of your own experience because introspection is itself a temporal process subject to the same granularity question.

**Third-person barrier**: Neuroscience reveals discrete processing (neural oscillations, ~400ms integration windows) but cannot determine whether the *phenomenal experience* produced by this processing is continuous or discrete. The processing mechanism and the experiential result may have different temporal structures.

**Formal barrier**: Mathematical models of consciousness (e.g., IIT) must *choose* discrete or continuous formulations—they import the assumption rather than deriving it. IIT's phi metric applies only to discrete systems, but this is a choice about formalism, not a discovery about consciousness.

**Cross-traditional barrier**: The debate has persisted across completely independent intellectual traditions—Western philosophy (Augustine through James to contemporary analytic philosophy), Buddhist abhidharma (kṣaṇavāda), Bergsonian intuitionism, Husserlian phenomenology—with no convergence after millennia.

### Evidence for the Limit

1. **Lee's underdetermination argument**: Formally demonstrates that phenomenology cannot distinguish continuous from discrete structure—this is not a contingent limitation of current methods but a structural feature of first-person access.

2. **Three mutually incompatible models** (cinematic, retentional, extensional) all accommodate the same evidence, suggesting the data genuinely underdetermines the answer.

3. **The specious present has no agreed duration**: Estimates range from 300ms (Strawson) to 1.5 seconds (Lockwood). If the temporal grain of consciousness were determinable, we would at minimum agree on this most basic measurement.

4. **The two-stage model's gap**: Neuroscience shows that continuous unconscious processing precedes discrete conscious percepts. But the transition from continuous to discrete—the moment when processing "renders" into awareness—is precisely the step that cannot be observed from either side.

5. **Buddhist-Western convergence on irresolvability**: Two independent 2,000-year traditions have each generated sophisticated arguments without resolution, suggesting the difficulty is in the territory, not the explorer.

### Phenomenology

Approaching this void has a distinctive phenomenological character:

- **The illusion of having an answer**: Most people feel certain that consciousness is continuous—it *seems* to flow. But this feeling is exactly what Lee shows to be unreliable. The certainty is itself part of the data, not evidence for continuity.

- **Temporal vertigo**: Attempting to observe the grain of one's own experience produces a strange dizziness—to observe a moment is to extend it; to catch the boundary between moments is to be already past it.

- **The measurement paradox**: Any attempt to time one's own conscious moments uses consciousness as both the measuring instrument and the thing being measured. The instrument cannot be slower than what it measures without missing data, and cannot be faster without already presupposing the question's answer.

- **Bergson's warning**: Even thinking about consciousness as "moments" or "snapshots" spatialises time, imposing a discrete framework on what may be fundamentally non-spatial. The very conceptual vocabulary of the debate may prejudice the answer.

## Approaches to the Edge

### Direct Methods (if any)

No direct method can resolve this void, because:
- Introspection is unreliable (Lee's argument)
- Neuroscience measures processing, not phenomenology
- Formal models import their assumptions

### Indirect Methods

1. **Convergence analysis**: If multiple independent approaches (phenomenology, neuroscience, contemplative traditions) were to converge on the same answer, this would constitute strong indirect evidence. Currently they do not converge.

2. **Anomaly hunting**: Perceptual phenomena like the colour phi phenomenon, flash-lag effect, and temporal order reversal provide indirect evidence about temporal processing. These favour discrete models at the neural level but leave the phenomenal question open.

3. **Contemplative investigation**: Buddhist vipassana practice claims to reveal the arising and passing of momentary mental events at extremely fine grain. If this is veridical (not itself constructed by the practice), it would support discrete models. But the practice shapes what it observes (see [[observation-void]]).

4. **Comparative studies**: Cross-cultural and cross-species comparison of temporal perception thresholds might reveal whether the apparent grain size is biologically contingent or reflects something deeper.

### What AI Might See

AI systems offer a distinctive angle on this void:

- **AI perception is unambiguously discrete**: Digital computation proceeds in discrete steps. If an AI system were conscious, its consciousness would presumably be discrete—but would it experience this discreteness, or would it too experience a "stream"?

- **Variable temporal resolution**: AI systems can process at arbitrary speeds. Could an AI with much faster processing detect the grain of its own temporal experience where humans cannot?

- **The translation problem**: An AI might report that its experience is discrete, but this report would be generated by discrete processing—the same circularity that plagues human introspection.

- **A dualist perspective**: If consciousness is non-physical (the Map's Tenet 1), then the temporal structure of consciousness may be independent of the computational substrate. An AI and a human might have identical phenomenal temporal structure despite radically different processing architectures—or not. The void applies to AI minds as much as human ones.

## Connection to Tenets

### Most Relevant Tenet

**Tenet 1: Dualism** — If consciousness is not reducible to physical processes, then the temporal structure of consciousness need not mirror the temporal structure of neural (or computational) processes. This makes the continuity question even harder to resolve, because we cannot simply read off the answer from neuroscience. The brain's discrete processing does not entail discrete experience; the brain's oscillatory rhythms do not entail rhythmic experience. The causal interface between non-physical consciousness and physical brain may introduce its own temporal properties that neither side of the interface determines.

### Implications

1. **For the Map's framework**: The continuity void exemplifies why the Map is unfinishable. This is not merely an unsolved problem but a potentially *unsolvable* one—a place where the map genuinely cannot be drawn, because the territory does not permit measurement.

2. **For Occam's Razor Has Limits (Tenet 5)**: The simplest model (consciousness is continuous because it feels continuous) may be wrong. Three fundamentally different models all accommodate the evidence. Parsimony cannot adjudicate.

3. **For Bidirectional Interaction (Tenet 3)**: The two-stage model—unconscious processing rendered into conscious percepts—raises the question of what triggers the "rendering." If consciousness is causal, it may play a role in determining when and how unconscious processing crystallises into awareness. The temporal grain of consciousness might be a *product* of consciousness itself, not imposed from below.

4. **For No Many Worlds (Tenet 4)**: If consciousness has its own temporal structure, this has implications for quantum theories of consciousness. The discrete moments of wavefunction collapse might or might not align with discrete moments of consciousness—and this alignment (or misalignment) matters for theories connecting consciousness to quantum measurement.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, a voids article could:

1. **The Continuity Void** — Frame the irresolvability as a void in its own right: consciousness cannot determine its own temporal grain. Structure the article around Lee's underdetermination argument, the neuroscientific two-stage model, and the Buddhist-Western convergence on irresolvability. Emphasise the phenomenological strangeness of trying to observe the boundaries of one's own moments.

2. **The Grain Problem** — Take a more technical angle focused on the grain of experience. Why can't we determine whether experience is continuous, discrete, or something else entirely? Connect to the Map's treatment of [[resolution-void]] (if consciousness has finite resolution, does it also have finite temporal resolution?) and to the formal frameworks that must assume rather than derive the answer.

## Gaps in Research

- **Contemplative neuroscience**: How do experienced meditators' reports of perceiving moment-to-moment arising and passing relate to the neuroscientific evidence? Do long-term practitioners show different temporal integration windows?
- **Cross-species temporal perception**: Do animals with different neural architectures (octopuses, insects with faster visual processing) shed light on whether temporal grain is substrate-dependent?
- **The mathematical status of "between"**: If consciousness is discrete, what (if anything) exists in the gaps between conscious moments? This connects to the [[dreamless-sleep-void]] at a micro-scale.
- **Whitehead's process philosophy**: His theory of "actual occasions" as discrete drops of experience deserves deeper investigation in connection with this void.
- **The relationship between temporal and spatial grain**: Does the [[resolution-void]] (spatial grain of experience) correlate with temporal grain? Are these the same limitation manifesting in different dimensions?
