## Executive Summary

Bradford Saad's 2025 paper "A dualist theory of experience" (*Philosophical Studies* 182:939-967) develops **delegatory dualism**—a novel interactionist position that addresses the causal exclusion problem by proposing that physical states "delegate" their causal responsibilities to experiences with matching causal profiles. This avoids both epiphenomenalism and overdetermination while maintaining mental causation. The theory satisfies five constraints Saad argues any adequate dualist theory should meet: Efficacy, Non-Overdetermination, Observational Closure, Upward Systematicity (psychophysical laws), and Organizational Invariance (functional duplication preserves phenomenology). Delegatory dualism aligns closely with the Map's Bidirectional Interaction and Dualism tenets, offering a sophisticated framework for how consciousness causally influences the physical world without violating empirical constraints.

## The Five Constraints

Saad argues any adequate dualist theory must satisfy these constraints:

### 1. Efficacy
Experiences must cause physical effects. This constraint rejects epiphenomenalism—the view that experiences are causally inert byproducts of physical processes.

**Relation to site tenets**: Directly aligns with Bidirectional Interaction, which holds that "consciousness is not a passive observer—it causally influences the physical world."

### 2. Non-Overdetermination
Experience-caused effects should not have both non-physical and concurrent sufficient physical causes. Overdetermination is theoretically unsatisfying and faces explanatory problems.

**Relation to site tenets**: The Map's framework (via quantum indeterminacy) also avoids overdetermination by having consciousness bias *undetermined* outcomes rather than overdetermining already-determined ones.

### 3. Observational Closure
Experiences should not cause *observable* violations of the causal closure of the physical domain. This is weaker than strict causal closure—it allows unobservable violations while preserving empirical adequacy.

**Relation to site tenets**: Compatible with Minimal Quantum Interaction, which specifies that consciousness influences quantum outcomes "without injecting energy or violating conservation laws" and rules out "any interaction that would be empirically detectable under current experimental precision."

### 4. Upward Systematicity
Fundamental psychophysical laws must determine which experiences arise from which physical states. This avoids arbitrary mind-body correlations.

**Relation to site tenets**: The Map presupposes systematic psychophysical correlations (consciousness interfaces with brains in lawful ways), though it doesn't specify the form of these laws.

### 5. Organizational Invariance
Duplicating functional organization should preserve phenomenology. Functional duplicates should have the same experiences.

**Relation to site tenets**: Neutral—the Map doesn't take a position on whether functional organization alone determines experience. This constraint may conflict with some interpretations of dualism that allow inverted qualia in functional duplicates.

## Major Positions

### Delegatory Dualism (Saad)
- **Proponents**: Bradford Saad
- **Core claim**: Physical states delegate their causal responsibilities to experiences with matching causal profiles, thereby avoiding overdetermination while preserving efficacy
- **Key arguments**:
  - A psychophysical law (Subset Law*) assigns experiences to physical states based on causal profile matching
  - When a match occurs, the experience preempts the physical state's causal contribution (Delegatory Law)
  - Uses analogy: a major's command preempts a sergeant's command to advance troops—no overdetermination, just preemption
- **Mechanism**: "Pain rather than the physical state causes you to wince" through this delegation process
- **Relation to site tenets**: Strong alignment with Bidirectional Interaction (consciousness causes behavior) while satisfying empirical constraints relevant to Minimal Quantum Interaction

### Epiphenomenalist Dualism
- **Proponents**: Chalmers (early work), Jackson (early), Gertler, Kim, Robinson
- **Core claim**: Experiences are non-physical but causally inert—they don't cause physical effects
- **Relation to site tenets**: Explicitly ruled out by Bidirectional Interaction tenet, which holds that "The very fact that we discuss consciousness provides strong evidence against epiphenomenalism"

### Overdeterminist Dualism
- **Proponents**: Fumerton, List & Stoljar, Meixner, Mills, Kroedel, Vaassen, White
- **Core claim**: Physical effects are overdetermined by both physical and non-physical causes
- **Relation to site tenets**: Less parsimonious than the Map's approach; the Map's quantum indeterminacy framework avoids overdetermination by locating mental causation at points of physical indeterminacy

### Cooperative Dualism (contrast case)
- **Core claim**: Experiences jointly cause effects with accompanying physical states
- **Status**: Satisfies Efficacy, Closure, Non-Overdetermination; fails Upward Systematicity
- **Relation to site tenets**: Partial alignment—avoids overdetermination but lacks systematic psychophysical laws

### Preemptive Dualism (contrast case)
- **Core claim**: Experiences preempt physical causes
- **Status**: Similar profile to Cooperative Dualism
- **Relation to site tenets**: Delegatory dualism can be seen as a more sophisticated version

### Subset Dualism (contrast case)
- **Core claim**: Experiential properties instantiate when causal profiles subset physical properties' profiles
- **Status**: Satisfies Upward Systematicity and Organizational Invariance but requires widespread overdetermination
- **Relation to site tenets**: Delegatory dualism improves on this by adding the delegation mechanism

### Tracking Dualism (Saad, separate work)
- **Proponents**: Bradford Saad (2024 Synthese paper)
- **Core claim**: Psychophysical laws generate experiences by operating on complex physical states involving both brain states and tracking relations to environmental features
- **Key innovation**: Physical basis of experience extends beyond the head into the world
- **Relation to site tenets**: Potentially compatible; extends the question of where consciousness interfaces with the physical

## Key Debates

### The Causal Exclusion Problem
- **Sides**: Physicalists claim physical events have sufficient physical causes (closure); dualists claim consciousness also causes physical effects (efficacy)
- **Core disagreement**: Whether mental causation is compatible with physical causal patterns
- **Saad's contribution**: Distinguishes *universal* Closure from *Observational* Closure; dualism need only respect the latter
- **Current state**: Saad offers the most sophisticated contemporary response; delegatory dualism satisfies empirical constraints while maintaining efficacy

### Observational vs. Universal Closure
- **Definition**: "Observational Closure: There are no observable violations of Closure"
- **Key insight**: "An observable violation of Closure is a violation... that would be recognized as such by an experiment of the sort performed in physics or neuroscience"
- **Implication**: Dualism need not respect strict causal closure—only empirical constraints
- **Relation to site tenets**: Provides theoretical justification for Minimal Quantum Interaction's claim that consciousness can influence outcomes without empirically detectable violations

### Quantum Interactionism vs. Delegatory Dualism
- **Contrast**: Stapp/Penrose-Hameroff locate mental causation at quantum indeterminacy; Saad's framework is more general
- **Compatibility**: Delegatory dualism is compatible with but doesn't require quantum mechanisms
- **Current state**: The frameworks could be integrated—quantum indeterminacy as the physical mechanism implementing delegation

## Tenet Alignment Analysis

### Dualism Tenet
**Alignment: Strong**

Saad explicitly defends substance dualism: "Dualism holds that experiences somehow arise from physical states, despite being neither identical with nor grounded in such states." His work develops sophisticated responses to the main objections, strengthening the dualist position.

### Bidirectional Interaction Tenet
**Alignment: Strong**

Delegatory dualism's Efficacy constraint directly supports bidirectional interaction: experiences cause physical effects. The delegation mechanism explains *how* this works without overdetermination or closure violations. This provides theoretical backing for the Map's claim that "consciousness is not a passive observer."

### Minimal Quantum Interaction Tenet
**Alignment: Compatible but non-committal**

Saad's Observational Closure constraint is compatible with minimal quantum interaction—both hold that mental causation shouldn't produce empirically detectable violations of physical patterns. However, delegatory dualism doesn't require quantum mechanisms; it's more general. The frameworks could be integrated by treating quantum indeterminacy as the physical substrate for delegation.

### No Many Worlds Tenet
**Alignment: Neutral**

Saad's framework doesn't address quantum interpretations directly. Delegatory dualism is compatible with collapse interpretations but doesn't require them.

### Occam's Razor Has Limits Tenet
**Alignment: Implicit support**

Saad's work demonstrates that sophisticated dualist theories can satisfy stringent constraints. The complexity of delegatory dualism over epiphenomenalism might seem to violate parsimony, but it better explains mental causation. This supports the Map's position that simplicity isn't always the right criterion.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, an article could:

1. **Delegatory Dualism and Mental Causation** - Explain Saad's five constraints and how delegatory dualism satisfies them. Show how this provides theoretical underpinning for the Map's Bidirectional Interaction tenet. Follow writing-style.md: front-load the key insight (delegation avoids both epiphenomenalism and overdetermination), use named-anchor summaries for technical concepts.

2. **Observational Closure: A Dualist-Friendly Constraint** - Argue that dualists need only respect observational, not universal, causal closure. This weakens the main argument against interactionism while remaining empirically responsible. Directly supports Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet.

3. **The Neural Discernment Problem** - Explore Saad's 2020 paper on how non-physical minds could exercise different causal powers over physiologically similar neurons. Relevant to the mechanism of mind-brain interaction.

4. **Cognitive Phenomenology and Dualism** - Develop Saad's 2023 argument that cognitive phenomenal realism bolsters dualism via the cognitive knowledge argument. Extends the knowledge argument (already covered) in new directions.

5. **Concept page for delegatory-dualism** - Add delegatory dualism to the Map's concept taxonomy, linking to interactionist-dualism.md, epiphenomenalism.md, and arguments-for-dualism.md.

When writing any article, follow `obsidian/project/writing-style.md` for:
- LLM optimization (front-load important information for truncation resilience)
- Named-anchor summary technique for forward references
- Relation to Site Perspective section connecting to tenets
- Avoid LLM cliches ("This is not X. It is Y." construct)
