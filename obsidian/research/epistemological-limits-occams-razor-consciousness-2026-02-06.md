## Executive Summary

The philosophical literature reveals deep problems with using Occam's Razor to adjudicate the consciousness debate. Multiple independent lines of argument converge on the same conclusion: parsimony fails as a decisive principle in this domain. The key reasons are (1) parsimony presupposes that competing theories explain the data equally well, but physicalism cannot explain phenomenal consciousness; (2) ontological parsimony (fewer entity types) often trades off against other forms of simplicity, so "simpler" is ambiguous; (3) contemporary accounts of why parsimony works in empirical science do not extend to metaphysical theory choice; and (4) the history of science shows parsimony has repeatedly pointed away from truth when our conceptual tools were inadequate to the domain. This research provides substantial academic backing for the Map's fifth tenet.

## Key Sources

### Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy — "Simplicity"
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Distinguishes ontological parsimony (fewer kinds of entities) from syntactic elegance (fewer/simpler principles)
  - These two dimensions "typically pull in different directions"—reducing ontology often increases syntactic complexity
  - Cases where competing hypotheses explain a phenomenon equally well "are comparatively rare"
  - Three justificatory frameworks: a priori (Swinburne), naturalistic (Sober), probabilistic/statistical (AIC, BIC)
  - Even probabilistic approaches yield incompatible recommendations about how to weight simplicity vs. accuracy
  - Materialists use parsimony against dualism to "shift the burden of proof" rather than definitively refute it
  - Historical counterexample: extensionist biogeography seemed less parsimonious, but plate tectonics vindicated it
- **Tenet alignment**: Strongly aligns with Tenet 5 (Occam's Razor Has Limits). The encyclopedia's own analysis shows parsimony is contested and unreliable.
- **Quote**: Sober argues "the legitimacy of parsimony stands or falls, in a particular research context, on subject matter specific (and a posteriori) considerations."

### Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy — "Simplicity in the Philosophy of Science"
- **URL**: https://iep.utm.edu/simplici/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Simplicity is not a unified concept—scientists employ "a cluster of different, sometimes related, but also sometimes conflicting notions"
  - Francis Crick warned that "Occam's razor... can be a very dangerous implement in biology"
  - "Judgments about the relative simplicity of particular theories appear irredeemably subjective"
  - The thesis that nature is simple is "difficult to formulate... so that it is not either obviously false, or too vague to be of any use"
  - Historical success of simple theories may reflect sampling bias: "maybe we have only looked at the problems most amenable to simple solutions"
  - Anti-realist critique: "the history of science shows that all theories, even eminently successful theories, typically turn out to be radically false"
- **Tenet alignment**: Strongly aligns with Tenet 5. The fragmentation of simplicity concepts undermines its use as a unified epistemic principle.

### Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy — "Hard Problem of Consciousness"
- **URL**: https://iep.utm.edu/hard-problem-of-conciousness/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Consciousness fails standard reductive explanation because it cannot be functionally analysed
  - Kriegel identifies three features resisting reduction: immediacy, indescribability, independence
  - Weak reductionists who accept physicalism on parsimony grounds must posit "brute identity" between neural and phenomenal properties—unprecedented at the neurological scale
  - Both weak reductionism and dual-aspect theory accept a "basic and brute connection" between brain and consciousness; the difference may be merely stylistic
  - "No evidence could decide between the views"—parsimony alone cannot resolve the question
- **Tenet alignment**: Strongly aligns with Tenets 1 (Dualism) and 5. The explanatory gap means physicalism cannot claim equal explanatory power, voiding the precondition for applying parsimony.
- **Quote**: Physicalism achieves simplicity "only by accepting an unexplained brute identity between distinct property types."

### Huemer — "When Is Parsimony a Virtue?" (2009)
- **URL**: https://philpapers.org/archive/HUEWIP.pdf
- **Type**: Journal article (*The Philosophical Quarterly* 59: 216-236)
- **Key points**:
  - Reviews four contemporary accounts of parsimony's virtue in empirical theorising
  - Finds that "none of the accounts of the virtue of parsimony extends naturally to either of these philosophical cases" (physicalism and nominalism)
  - In typical philosophical contexts, "ontological parsimony has no evidential value"
  - Physical monism appears simpler by entity count, but "this numerical advantage provides no rational justification for preferring it over property dualism"
  - The fundamental puzzle: almost everyone agrees simplicity is a theoretical virtue, yet "very few have any idea why this might be true"
- **Tenet alignment**: Directly supports Tenet 5. Huemer's analysis is perhaps the strongest individual argument that parsimony fails in exactly the domain where physicalists invoke it.

### Zanotti — "Physicalism and the Burden of Parsimony" (2021)
- **URL**: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-021-03281-7
- **Type**: Journal article (*Synthese* 199: 11109-11132)
- **Key points**:
  - Challenges the common assumption that parsimony favours physicalism
  - Argues that "the modesty rationale does not ultimately favour physicalism over dualism"
  - Physicalists take for granted that parsimony has epistemic value in metaphysics—but this is controversial
  - Justifications for scientific uses of parsimony often do not apply to metaphysical arguments
- **Tenet alignment**: Directly supports Tenet 5. A recent, focused academic treatment of exactly the Map's concern.

### "Parsimony and the Mind" (Hubbard)
- **URL**: http://www.tk421.net/essays/simple.html
- **Type**: Essay/Article
- **Key points**:
  - Distinguishes three types of parsimony: epistemological, ontological, linguistic
  - For parsimony to apply, both theories must explain the data equally well—physicalism does not explain phenomenal consciousness
  - Consciousness exhibits properties that "could not be observed no matter how far knowledge and technology developed" (Natsoulas 1984)
  - Eliminating mental terminology creates linguistic complications—"a high-level explanation is often more comprehensible" (Chalmers 1996)
  - Addis contends that "ontological economy can never be an argument in itself" when mental phenomena require special consideration
- **Tenet alignment**: Aligns with Tenets 1 and 5. Argues parsimony's preconditions are not met for consciousness.

### Krizek — "Ockham's Razor and the Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics" (2017)
- **URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06564
- **Type**: Preprint (arXiv)
- **Key points**:
  - Analyses whether Ockham's razor can adjudicate between quantum interpretations
  - "Simplicity is a very subjective criterion unless it is somehow quantified by a measure"
  - Many-Worlds appears simpler axiomatically (fewer postulates) but vastly more complex ontologically (uncountable universes)
  - Copenhagen appears simpler ontologically but adds the collapse postulate
  - Demonstrates that parsimony yields contradictory verdicts depending on which dimension of simplicity is weighted
- **Tenet alignment**: Aligns with Tenets 4 (No Many Worlds) and 5. Shows parsimony cannot resolve interpretive questions in quantum mechanics, exactly the domain where the Map's framework operates.

### Wikipedia — "Occam's Razor"
- **URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - J. J. C. Smart invoked Occam's Razor to justify mind-brain identity theory, but was "severely criticized" and "ultimately retracted his advocacy"
  - Paul Churchland states Occam's Razor is "inconclusive regarding duality"
  - Occam's Razor "never allows us to deny putative entities; at best it allows us to refrain from positing them in the absence of known compelling reasons"
  - It is "entirely a metaphysical assumption" when used as extraevidential consideration
- **Tenet alignment**: The Smart retraction is historically significant—even a prominent advocate abandoned parsimony arguments for physicalism.

## Major Positions

### Physicalist Appeal to Parsimony
- **Proponents**: J. J. C. Smart (later retracted), Paul Churchland (qualified), many contemporary physicalists
- **Core claim**: Physicalism posits only one kind of substance (physical) whereas dualism posits two, so physicalism is more parsimonious and should be preferred
- **Key arguments**:
  - Fewer ontological categories = simpler theory
  - Science has successfully reduced other seemingly distinct phenomena (heat, lightning, life) to physical processes
  - Parsimony as a general epistemic principle should apply to the mind-body problem as it does elsewhere
- **Relation to site tenets**: Conflicts with Tenets 1 and 5. The Map argues this reasoning fails because (a) physicalism does not actually explain consciousness, and (b) parsimony is unreliable in domains of incomplete understanding.

### Parsimony Scepticism (Global)
- **Proponents**: Elliott Sober, Michael Huemer, Giacomo Zanotti
- **Core claim**: Parsimony has no universal epistemic justification—its legitimacy is domain-specific and requires empirical background assumptions
- **Key arguments**:
  - Scientific justifications for parsimony (predictive success, avoiding overfitting) do not extend to metaphysical theory choice
  - Sober: parsimony requires "local background assumptions" and has no global justification
  - Huemer: four accounts of parsimony's virtue in empirical science all fail to extend to philosophy
  - Zanotti: the "modesty rationale" does not ultimately favour physicalism
- **Relation to site tenets**: Strongly aligns with Tenet 5. These authors provide the academic foundation for the claim that parsimony has limits.

### Explanatory Gap Defence
- **Proponents**: Joseph Levine, David Chalmers, Thomas Nagel
- **Core claim**: Parsimony applies only when theories explain equally well; physicalism fails to explain phenomenal consciousness, so the precondition for parsimony is unmet
- **Key arguments**:
  - Levine's explanatory gap: physical descriptions don't entail why there is something it is like to be conscious
  - Chalmers' hard problem: functional/structural explanation cannot capture phenomenal experience
  - Nagel's subjective character: objective theories inevitably "abandon that point of view" needed for consciousness
  - Even weak reductionism must accept "brute identity"—parsimony buys nothing when identity is unexplained
- **Relation to site tenets**: Strongly aligns with Tenets 1 and 5. The explanatory gap is the Map's central reason for rejecting physicalism.

### Simplicity Pluralism
- **Proponents**: Alan Baker (SEP), Jonathan Schaffer ("The Laser"), W.V.O. Quine
- **Core claim**: Simplicity is not one thing—ontological, syntactic, and other forms of simplicity routinely conflict with each other
- **Key arguments**:
  - Reducing ontology often increases ideological (theoretical) complexity (Quine's ontology-ideology trade-off)
  - Schaffer proposes "The Laser"—parsimony should only apply to fundamental entities
  - Baker: different simplicity measures yield different rankings of the same theories
  - Galileo preferred ontologically simpler circular orbits; Kepler's ellipses were syntactically simpler—both can't be "simpler"
- **Relation to site tenets**: Aligns with Tenet 5. Even granting that parsimony has some epistemic value, its multidimensionality means it cannot yield a clear verdict on the mind-body problem.

### Historical Failure View
- **Proponents**: Various; implicit in history of science
- **Core claim**: Parsimony has repeatedly pointed away from truth when our conceptual tools were inadequate to the domain
- **Key arguments**:
  - Heliocentrism initially required more epicycles than geocentrism (the "simpler" model was wrong)
  - Atomic theory posited invisible entities when continuous matter seemed simpler
  - Quantum mechanics replaced deterministic simplicity with probability and superposition
  - General relativity curved spacetime rather than keeping flat space with forces
  - Biogeography: extensionism seemed less parsimonious until plate tectonics vindicated it
- **Relation to site tenets**: Directly aligns with Tenet 5, which lists several of these same counterexamples. History shows parsimony is unreliable precisely when our conceptual framework is incomplete—exactly the situation for consciousness.

## Key Debates

### Does Parsimony Have Epistemic Value in Metaphysics?
- **Sides**: Sober/Huemer/Zanotti (no general epistemic value) vs. Swinburne (a priori epistemic principle) vs. Lewis/Quine (pragmatic/qualitative value only)
- **Core disagreement**: Whether the reasons parsimony works in empirical science (avoiding overfitting, predictive success) transfer to metaphysical contexts where empirical testing is impossible
- **Current state**: No consensus. The trend in recent literature favours scepticism—Huemer (2009) and Zanotti (2021) represent a growing challenge to uncritical parsimony appeals.

### Equal Explanatory Power Precondition
- **Sides**: Physicalists (claim equal or superior explanatory power) vs. dualists (claim the explanatory gap shows physicalism explains less)
- **Core disagreement**: Whether physicalism actually explains consciousness or merely correlates neural states with phenomenal states
- **Current state**: Ongoing. The hard problem remains central. Even sympathetic physicalists (e.g., weak reductionists) concede "brute identity" is needed, undermining the claim of full explanation.

### Ontological vs. Other Parsimony
- **Sides**: Traditional parsimony proponents (ontological economy is decisive) vs. pluralists (multiple simplicity dimensions must be weighed)
- **Core disagreement**: Whether having fewer entity types is sufficient grounds for theory preference, or whether syntactic, linguistic, and explanatory complexity must also be considered
- **Current state**: The pluralist view is increasingly accepted. Quine's ontology-ideology trade-off and Schaffer's "Laser" proposal both recognise that ontological parsimony alone is insufficient.

### Many-Worlds and Parsimony
- **Sides**: MWI proponents (axiomatically simpler—no collapse postulate) vs. collapse-interpretation proponents (ontologically simpler—one universe)
- **Core disagreement**: Which dimension of simplicity should be weighted more heavily—axiomatic economy or ontological economy
- **Current state**: Unresolved. This debate itself demonstrates that parsimony cannot settle interpretive questions in fundamental physics, let alone consciousness.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, an article could:

1. **"Why Occam's Razor Cannot Settle the Consciousness Debate"** — A comprehensive treatment of why parsimony fails in this domain, covering the equal-explanation precondition, the pluralism of simplicity dimensions, and historical counterexamples. Directly supports Tenet 5 and strengthens the Map's case for dualism (Tenet 1). Could draw on Huemer, Zanotti, the explanatory gap, and the quantum interpretation debate.

2. **"The Parsimony Illusion: How Simplicity Hides Ignorance"** — A more provocative angle focusing on the historical pattern where parsimony pointed away from truth precisely because the conceptual tools of the era were inadequate. Frame consciousness as another such case. Aligns with Tenet 5's claim that "apparent simplicity of physicalism could reflect ignorance rather than insight."

3. **"Simplicity Against Itself: When Parsimony Arguments Cancel Out"** — Focus on the internal tensions: ontological vs. syntactic simplicity, Quine's ontology-ideology trade-off, the Many-Worlds paradox (axiomatically simple, ontologically extravagant). Argue that parsimony is too fragmented to serve as a unified principle. Supports Tenets 4 and 5.

When writing the article, follow `obsidian/project/writing-style.md` for:
- Named-anchor summary technique for forward references
- Background vs. novelty decisions (minimise standard definitions of Occam's Razor—focus on the novel critique)
- Tenet alignment requirements (connect explicitly to Tenet 5, with links to Tenets 1 and 4)
- LLM optimisation (front-load the conclusion that parsimony fails for consciousness)

## Gaps in Research

- **Formal Bayesian treatments**: Some philosophers (e.g., Swinburne, Draper) have developed Bayesian frameworks for evaluating simplicity. Further research could examine whether Bayesian approaches vindicate or undermine parsimony for consciousness specifically.
- **Sober's detailed case studies**: Sober's *Ockham's Razors* (2015) provides extended analysis of parsimony in specific scientific contexts. A closer reading could yield more precise domain-specific arguments.
- **The "cost" of brute identity**: How exactly does accepting brute identity between neural and phenomenal properties compare, in parsimony terms, to accepting dualism? The literature touches this but a more detailed analysis could be valuable.
- **Crick's biology warning**: Francis Crick's claim that Occam's Razor is "dangerous in biology" could be developed further—consciousness is a biological phenomenon, so the biology-specific critique may carry special weight.
- **Schaffer's "Laser" applied to consciousness**: If parsimony should only concern fundamental entities, what follows for consciousness? If phenomenal properties are fundamental (as property dualists claim), they incur no parsimony cost under the Laser. This argument deserves dedicated treatment.
- **Cross-cultural intuitions about simplicity**: Whether simplicity preferences are culturally universal or Western-specific could bear on the metaphysical debate.
