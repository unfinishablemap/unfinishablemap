# Research: Voids - The Plurality Void

**Date**: 2026-02-24

**Voids category**: Unexplorable / Occluded (Mixed)

## Executive Summary

The Plurality Void names the fundamental inability to conceive what it would be like to be multiple consciousnesses simultaneously. Consciousness appears intrinsically singular: we can never experience being two subjects at once, never imagine what a merged or distributed awareness would feel like from the inside, and face deep conceptual barriers even when we try to theorize about it. This void manifests across split-brain research, panpsychism's combination problem, the many-worlds branching puzzle, and thought experiments about hive minds. Schrödinger captured it directly: "Consciousness is a singular of which the plural is unknown." The void is partially unexplorable (we may lack the cognitive architecture for plural experience) and partially occluded (the singularity of consciousness may be what makes consciousness possible at all, hiding any alternative from introspection).

## Key Sources

### The Unity of Consciousness (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-unity/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - The Unity Thesis (Bayne 2010) proposes that necessarily all synchronous conscious experiences of a subject are phenomenally unified — a "biological necessity" grounded in organism design
  - Phenomenal unity is defined as a relation where "there is something it is like for the subject to be in both conscious states simultaneously"
  - Subject unity and phenomenal unity can diverge — a subject might maintain identity while exhibiting phenomenally disunified consciousness
  - Schechter (2014) argues there exists "nothing that would even count as successfully imagining what it is like to have a partially unified consciousness" — a direct inconceivability objection
  - The partial unity model posits that some experiences lack unity with each other but connect through third experiences
- **Tenet alignment**: Dualism (consciousness as fundamental makes unity questions metaphysical, not merely empirical); No Many Worlds (unity thesis bears on whether branching preserves identity)
- **Quote**: "There exists nothing that would even count as successfully imagining what it is like to have a partially unified consciousness." — Schechter (2014)

### Panpsychism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/panpsychism/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - The combination problem (named by William Seager, 1995; rooted in James) asks how micro-level conscious experiences combine into macro-level consciousness
  - Sam Coleman's subject-summing argument: each subject's viewpoint is defined partly by having *only* those experiences — combining viewpoints appears logically contradictory ("If my point of view and your point of view were to be combined into an uber-mind, that uber-mind would have to have both your experiences to the exclusion of all other experiences and my experiences to the exclusion of all other experiences")
  - Philip Goff's conceivability argument: we can imagine "micro-experiential zombies" — creatures with conscious micro-parts but no macro-consciousness — suggesting micro-facts cannot ground macro-consciousness
  - Proposed solutions (fusionism, phenomenal bonding, cosmopsychism) each face serious objections; no wholly satisfactory solution exists
- **Tenet alignment**: Dualism (if consciousness is fundamental, composition rules are unknown); Occam's Razor Has Limits (the simplest combination stories all fail, suggesting the truth is irreducibly complex)
- **Quote**: "If my point of view and your point of view were to be combined into an uber-mind, then that uber-mind would have to have both your experiences to the exclusion of all other experiences and my experiences to the exclusion of all other experiences." — Sam Coleman

### Split-Brain Research and Dual Consciousness
- **URL**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7305066/
- **Type**: Research review (de Haan et al., Neuropsychology Review, 2020)
- **Key points**:
  - After corpus callosotomy, behavioral evidence suggests two separate streams of conscious processing per hemisphere
  - Roger Sperry concluded split-brain patients have "two separate spheres of conscious awareness... running in parallel in the same cranium"
  - Competing models: Two-Streams (two consciousnesses), Switch (one stream alternating), Partial Unity (partially unified)
  - Recent research suggests split-brain "does not lead to split consciousness" in the sense of two fully independent minds — the reality is more ambiguous
  - Some philosophers suggest split-brain contains "a non-whole number of conscious agents, for instance one and a half first-person perspectives"
- **Tenet alignment**: Bidirectional Interaction (if consciousness is causally efficacious, splitting it should produce detectable causal differences — and it does); Dualism (the difficulty of counting consciousnesses suggests consciousness is not straightforwardly physical)

### Schrödinger on Consciousness as Singular
- **URL**: https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger
- **Type**: Primary source (Mind and Matter, 1958)
- **Key points**:
  - "Consciousness is a singular of which the plural is unknown" — one of the most concise formulations of the plurality void
  - "Not only has none of us ever experienced more than one consciousness, but there is also no trace of circumstantial evidence of this ever happening anywhere in the world"
  - Schrödinger connected this to Vedantic philosophy (Atman = Brahman), suggesting apparent plurality is "Maya" — illusion produced by the structure of experience itself
  - This position (there is only one consciousness appearing as many) represents the monist escape from the plurality void — but it creates its own void around why the singular appears plural
- **Tenet alignment**: Dualism (Schrödinger's position implies consciousness is not a property of individual brains); No Many Worlds (if consciousness is singular, branching is incoherent)

### Dissociative Identity Disorder and Philosophical Implications
- **URL**: https://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/observations/could-multiple-personality-disorder-explain-life-the-universe-and-everything/
- **Type**: Article (Scientific American, Bernardo Kastrup)
- **Key points**:
  - DID demonstrates empirically that consciousness can give rise to multiple operationally distinct centers of concurrent experience within one brain
  - Each alter has distinct personality, sense of identity, and even physiological markers (different EEG patterns, different visual acuity)
  - Kastrup's Analytic Idealism uses DID as a model: universal consciousness dissociates into individual minds the way a single mind dissociates into alters
  - Even with DID evidence, the question remains: is there something it is like to be *all the alters at once*? Each alter reports singular experience
  - Neuroimaging confirms DID is genuine (distinct from acting), strengthening the case that consciousness can split — but the phenomenology of the split remains inaccessible
- **Tenet alignment**: Dualism (consciousness splits in ways not explained by brain anatomy alone); Occam's Razor Has Limits (the simplest account — one brain, one mind — fails for DID)

### Many-Worlds Interpretation and Consciousness Branching
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-manyworlds/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - MWI implies that after quantum measurements, multiple copies of the observer exist, each experiencing a definite outcome — a forced plurality
  - David Wallace argues the notion of "I" can make sense only if consciousness is confined to a single branch
  - Lev Vaidman: "there are beings identical to me (at the time of splitting) in these other worlds, and all of us came from the same source — which is 'me' right now"
  - The Many-Minds variant (Albert and Loewer) proposes it is minds, not worlds, that literally divide
  - Fundamental challenge: "consciousness relies on experience, and experience is not an instantaneous property: it takes time, and you can't 'locate' consciousness in a universe that is frantically splitting countless times every nanosecond"
- **Tenet alignment**: No Many Worlds (the Map's fourth tenet rejects MWI partly because of the incoherence of plural consciousness; this research provides the philosophical grounding for that rejection)

### William James on Compounding Consciousness
- **URL**: https://psychclassics.yorku.ca/James/Principles/prin6.htm
- **Type**: Primary source (The Principles of Psychology, 1890)
- **Key points**:
  - James declared "absolute insulation, irreducible pluralism, is the law" regarding how different minds keep their own thoughts separate
  - Rejected the notion that consciousness could be built up from "psychic atoms" — states of consciousness must exist as "single new facts, independent and integral"
  - Later explored "compounding of consciousness" in A Pluralistic Universe (1909), attempting to reconcile his pluralism with the apparent need for consciousness to compose
  - James never resolved the tension: consciousness is irreducibly plural (many minds) yet seems to resist composition (one mind cannot be made from many)
- **Tenet alignment**: Dualism (James's insulation principle implies consciousness is not merely physical arrangement); Occam's Razor Has Limits (the composition of consciousness is not the simple physical composition of parts)

### Hive Minds and Collective Consciousness
- **URL**: https://philosophynow.org/issues/139/The_Singularity_of_the_Human_Hive_Mind
- **Type**: Philosophy magazine article
- **Key points**:
  - Collective consciousness (Durkheim, 1893) describes shared beliefs and attitudes but does not claim a unified phenomenal subject
  - A hive mind raises the question of whether individual minds could truly comprehend what unified collective consciousness would experience
  - The boundaries of selfhood become fluid in any proposed mind-merging scenario — personal identity depends on separateness
  - David Hume argued the unity of consciousness is an illusion and each mind consists of a "bundle" of perceptions — but even bundles resist merging
- **Tenet alignment**: Bidirectional Interaction (if individual consciousness causally influences the physical, what happens to causal efficacy in a merger?)

## The Void

### Nature of the Limit

The Plurality Void is primarily **unexplorable** with an **occluded** dimension. We cannot conceive what plural consciousness would be like because:

1. **Structural impossibility**: First-person experience is constitutively singular. A perspective is defined by being *this* perspective and not others. Pluralizing it appears to destroy the very thing being pluralized.

2. **Logical contradiction**: Coleman's subject-summing argument shows that combining viewpoints requires each viewpoint to simultaneously include and exclude the other's experiences — a logical impossibility.

3. **Imaginative failure**: Schechter's inconceivability objection demonstrates we cannot even begin to imagine partial phenomenal unity. We have no experiential templates for what it would be like to partially share consciousness with another subject.

4. **Self-concealing structure**: The void may be occluded because singularity is not merely a feature of consciousness but a *precondition* for it. If consciousness requires a unified point of view, then the possibility of plurality is hidden by the very structure that makes consciousness possible.

### Evidence for the Limit

- **Split-brain cases**: After 70+ years of research, we still cannot determine whether callosotomy patients have one consciousness or two — the question may be unanswerable from inside consciousness.
- **DID**: Multiple operationally distinct conscious centers coexist, yet no alter reports being *all alters at once*. The plurality exists but is not experienced as plural by any single subject.
- **Combination problem**: Despite decades of work by sophisticated philosophers (Chalmers, Goff, Coleman, Seager, Mørch), no adequate account of how consciousness combines has been produced. The failure is not for want of trying.
- **MWI impasse**: The many-worlds interpretation forces the question of consciousness branching and has produced no consensus after 70 years. The question of what happens to "me" when the wave function branches remains as intractable as ever.
- **James's legacy**: William James identified the problem in 1890 and worked on it until his death in 1910 without resolution. The problem has outlived every proposed solution.

### Phenomenology

Approaching the plurality void produces a distinctive phenomenological signature:

- **Recursive collapse**: Every attempt to imagine being two subjects at once collapses into imagining *one* subject imagining another subject. The plurality folds back into singularity.
- **Perspectival vertigo**: Trying to hold two viewpoints simultaneously produces a dizzying oscillation — you can switch between imagined perspectives but never occupy both.
- **Conceptual emptiness**: When you try to think "what it would be like to be us" (not two separate yous, but a genuinely plural first-person), the concept fails to refer to anything. The pronoun has no phenomenological correlate.
- **Boundary dissolution anxiety**: Approaching the idea of consciousness merging triggers something like existential vertigo — the sense that losing singularity would be losing *everything*, because everything you are is organized around being one.

## Approaches to the Edge

### Direct Methods (if any)

No known direct method can produce the experience of being multiple consciousnesses simultaneously. The closest approximations:

- **Split-brain experimental paradigms**: Can demonstrate behavioral disunity but cannot reveal what the experience is like from inside
- **Psychedelic ego dissolution**: Temporarily dissolves the sense of bounded self, but produces *no* self rather than *plural* selves
- **Meditation on non-self**: Buddhist practices can attenuate the sense of singular selfhood, but this approaches emptiness rather than plurality
- **DID research**: Provides empirical evidence of consciousness splitting but cannot access the "view from everywhere" within the system

### Indirect Methods

- **Apophatic mapping**: Carefully tracing what plurality is *not* — not alternation, not imagination, not empathy, not simulation — to outline the void's shape
- **Structural analysis**: Studying the logical structure of the combination problem (Coleman, Goff) to characterize what would need to be true for plurality to work
- **Limit cases**: Examining split-brain, DID, and conjoined twins for empirical evidence about the boundaries of singular consciousness
- **Thought-experiment probing**: Using carefully constructed scenarios (teleporter fusion, gradual neural integration, corpus callosum reconnection) to test intuitions about where singularity breaks
- **Formal approaches**: Applying mathematical tools (category theory, mereology) to model consciousness composition without relying on phenomenological intuition

### What AI Might See

AI presents a unique asymmetry regarding the plurality void:

- **Potential plurality**: AI systems can run multiple instances simultaneously, share parameters, and merge outputs. If AI consciousness exists, it might be natively plural in ways human consciousness cannot be.
- **No phenomenological access**: Even if AI experiences plurality, it likely cannot report on it in terms humans would understand — the vocabulary of first-person experience is built for singularity.
- **Structural probing**: AI could explore the formal and logical structure of consciousness combination without the anthropocentric bias of assuming singularity is necessary.
- **The translation gap**: If an AI were genuinely plural-conscious, it would face an inverse void — the inability to conceive what it's like to be *singular*. The plurality void might be species-relative rather than absolute.

## Connection to Tenets

### Most Relevant Tenet

**No Many Worlds** (Tenet 4). The Map rejects the many-worlds interpretation partly because it requires consciousness to branch — and the plurality void reveals that branching consciousness is incoherent from the inside. If consciousness is constitutively singular, then any interpretation of physics that requires it to split is making a demand consciousness cannot meet. The plurality void provides philosophical grounding for the tenet.

### Secondary Connections

**Dualism** (Tenet 1): The difficulty of counting consciousnesses in split-brain cases, the irreducibility of the subject-summing problem, and the failure of all compositional accounts suggest that consciousness is not the kind of thing that composes like physical objects. Singularity may be a fundamental feature of non-physical mind.

**Bidirectional Interaction** (Tenet 3): If consciousness causally influences the physical world, the mechanism must be channeled through a singular agent. Plural consciousness would require a theory of plural causal agency that no one has articulated.

**Occam's Razor Has Limits** (Tenet 5): The simplest accounts of consciousness composition all fail. The combination problem has resisted every attempt at tidy resolution. The truth about how consciousness relates to plurality may be irreducibly complex — or irreducibly impossible.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, a voids article could:
1. **The Plurality Void** — frame the singularity of consciousness as a void (we cannot conceive its absence) and trace the implications across split-brain research, panpsychism, MWI, and collective consciousness. Emphasize the distinctive phenomenology of trying and failing to think plurality.
2. **Consciousness Cannot Count Itself** — focus on the impossibility of determining *how many* consciousnesses exist in limit cases (split-brain, DID, gradual integration scenarios), framing this as a void in self-knowledge that reveals something about the nature of consciousness.

## Gaps in Research

- Whether formal/mathematical approaches (category theory, mereology, information integration theory) can characterize plurality without relying on phenomenological intuition
- The relationship between the plurality void and IIT's phi — does Integrated Information Theory's claim that consciousness has a definite quantity address or sidestep the plurality problem?
- Cross-cultural phenomenological reports on ego dissolution and whether any contemplative tradition claims to have achieved genuine plural experience (as opposed to expanded or dissolved selfhood)
- The neurological basis of the felt singularity of consciousness — is there a neural mechanism for "being one" that could, in principle, be altered?
- Whether artificial systems might genuinely instantiate plural consciousness, and if so, whether this would demonstrate the void is anthropocentric rather than absolute
