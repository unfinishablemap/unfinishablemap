## Executive Summary

The existing voids articles explore cognitive limits imposed by biological architecture (embodiment, evolution, neural structure) and formal limits (Gödel, computational undecidability). But there is a deeper stratum of constraint that neither captures: limits imposed by the laws of physics themselves. If consciousness is physically realized, then the particular nomic structure of our universe—thermodynamic irreversibility, the speed of light, quantum uncertainty, the specific values of fundamental constants—constrains what kinds of minds can exist and what those minds can think. This "nomic void" is the territory of thoughts that are not merely beyond human brains but beyond any mind possible under our physics. Different physical laws might permit fundamentally different forms of cognition, but we cannot know what we are missing because we cannot think from outside our nomic context.

## Key Sources

### Noson Yanofsky — "The Mind and the Limitations of Physics" (2017)
- **URL**: http://www.sci.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~noson/Mind%20and%20Physics.pdf
- **Type**: Academic essay (FQXi contest)
- **Key points**:
  - Takes a Kantian-inspired approach: cognitive limitations of the human mind play a fundamental role in shaping what we perceive as the laws of physics
  - The mind's central role is to gather and sift through information; this process affects our knowledge of the physical universe
  - Several limitations of classical physics, statistical mechanics, relativity, and quantum mechanics are explained from this cognitive perspective
  - The mind taxonomizes—grouping, classifying, categorizing sensations—and this act of categorization creates what we experience as physical law
- **Tenet alignment**: Strongly supports Occam's Razor Has Limits — what seems like a simple, elegant law may be an artifact of cognitive filtering
- **Quote**: The mind "brings together sensations as if objects exist with their concomitant properties"

### Sean Carroll — "Consciousness and the Laws of Physics" (2021)
- **URL**: https://philarchive.org/rec/CARCAT-33
- **Type**: Academic paper
- **Key points**:
  - The "Core Theory" (Standard Model + general relativity) works within a domain large enough to include everything that happens in everyday life, including inside ourselves
  - Presents a dilemma for non-physicalists: either consciousness keeps Core Theory dynamics intact, or it doesn't — and any proposed modification must meet an extremely high evidential standard
  - An electron responds to fields at its location in well-understood ways that make no reference to whether it's in a nail, brain, or interstellar space
  - Argues against "double-counting" — describing something as both particles obeying the Core Theory and as having additional causal properties
- **Tenet alignment**: This is the strongest physicalist challenge to the Map's dualism tenet. Carroll's argument implies the nomic void cuts deeper than the Map's framework acknowledges — if Core Theory fully governs neural activity, then consciousness must either supervene on it (no room for dualist influence) or violate it (empirically testable and not yet observed)
- **Quote**: "Either your theory of consciousness keeps the dynamics of the Core Theory intact within its domain of applicability, or it doesn't"

### Stephen Wolfram — "What Is Consciousness?" and the Ruliad (2021)
- **URL**: https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/
- **Type**: Extended essay / theoretical framework
- **Key points**:
  - The "ruliad" is the entangled limit of all possible computational processes — the ultimate formal object underlying all reality
  - Different conscious observers occupy different positions in "rulial space" and may experience entirely different physics
  - An alien intelligence could be experiencing the universe "in a different rulial reference frame, utterly incoherent with the one we use"
  - The physics we observe emerges from constraints on how any computationally bounded observer must perceive reality — not from the underlying structure alone
  - Consciousness involves selecting a specific frame from infinite possibilities: "any observer who forms their perception of the universe in a computationally bounded way must inevitably perceive the universe to follow the laws of general relativity"
  - The radical inversion: physics doesn't produce consciousness; consciousness (as computationally bounded observation) produces the appearance of physics
- **Tenet alignment**: Directly relevant to the nomic void — if different observers get different physics, then our nomic context is observer-relative, and the void is the set of all rulial positions we cannot occupy. Supports Dualism (consciousness as prior to physics) and Occam's Razor Has Limits (our "simple" laws are artifacts of our observational position)
- **Quote**: "An alien intelligence could perfectly well be experiencing the universe in a different rulial reference frame, utterly incoherent with the one we use"

### Noam Chomsky — "Science, Mind, and Limits of Understanding" (2014)
- **URL**: https://chomsky.info/201401__/
- **Type**: Lecture / essay
- **Key points**:
  - Distinguishes problems (within cognitive reach) from mysteries (beyond it), relativized to organisms
  - "The endowment that yields scope also establishes limits" — the genetic/physical basis enabling cognition simultaneously constrains it
  - What is a mystery for rats might not be for humans; what is a mystery for humans might be trivial for a differently structured mind
  - Consciousness may be a "mystery-for-humans" rather than a solvable problem
  - Calls this "truism" rather than mysticism — anyone who accepts modern biology accepts cognitive limits
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports Occam's Razor Has Limits — our preference for tractable theories may be a cognitive artifact. Chomsky's organism-relative mysteries imply the nomic void: creatures under different physical laws would face different mysteries
- **Quote**: "The endowment that yields scope also establishes limits"

### Edward Witten — on consciousness as permanent mystery (2016)
- **URL**: http://wavefunction.fieldofscience.com/2016/08/physicist-ed-witten-on-consciousness-i.html
- **Type**: Interview / reported remarks
- **Key points**:
  - Witten: "I think consciousness will remain a mystery"
  - The "how" of consciousness (neural mechanisms) may be achievable; the "why" (why subjective experience accompanies processing) will remain out of reach
  - Even discovering the ultimate laws of physics would not resolve the mystery
  - Believes it "won't remain a mystery if there is a modification in the laws of physics as they apply to the brain" but considers this "very unlikely"
- **Tenet alignment**: Witten's position precisely marks the nomic void boundary — even complete knowledge of physics may not cross it. Supports Dualism (consciousness resists physical explanation) and Occam's Razor Has Limits (the simplest complete physics still leaves consciousness unexplained)
- **Quote**: "I tend to believe that it will remain a mystery"

### Kant — Transcendental Idealism (1781/1787)
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-transcendental-idealism/
- **Type**: Philosophical framework (Stanford Encyclopedia summary)
- **Key points**:
  - Our perception of reality is shaped by the innate structures of the human mind — space, time, and twelve categories of understanding
  - The phenomena (world as experienced) is governed by categories and forms of intuition innate to human cognition
  - The noumena (things-in-themselves) remain beyond our capacity to experience directly
  - Cognition is necessarily confined to appearances — we cannot know things as they are independently of how our cognitive faculties structure experience
  - This implies our physics is phenomenal physics — shaped by how minds like ours must perceive — not noumenal physics
- **Tenet alignment**: The original philosophical articulation of the nomic void. If our cognitive architecture shapes what we can perceive as physical law, then the void includes all noumenal structure inaccessible through our categories. Strongly supports Occam's Razor Has Limits and has deep connections to Dualism (mind is not simply a product of physics if mind shapes what counts as physics)

### Landauer's Principle and Bremermann's Limit
- **URLs**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer's_principle, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bremermann's_limit
- **Type**: Physics / information theory
- **Key points**:
  - Landauer's principle: erasing one bit of information dissipates minimum energy kT ln(2) — computation has thermodynamic cost
  - Bremermann's limit: maximum computational rate is c²/h ≈ 1.36 × 10⁵⁰ bits per second per kilogram
  - These are hard physics constraints on any information-processing system in our universe, including brains and computers
  - A universe with different values of c, h, or k would have different computational limits — and therefore different cognitive limits
  - Computation is a physical process that must obey the laws of physics (Landauer)
- **Tenet alignment**: These physical limits establish the "floor" of the nomic void — not just architectural limits (neurons are slow) but universal limits (no physical system in our universe can compute faster than Bremermann's limit). Supports the nomic void concept: under different physics, different computation would be possible, enabling different cognition

### John Archibald Wheeler — "It from Bit" and the Participatory Universe
- **URL**: https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/09/02/it-from-bit-wheeler/
- **Type**: Foundational physics / philosophy
- **Key points**:
  - "It from bit": every physical quantity derives its existence from information-theoretic origins
  - The universe is "participatory" — observer participation is constitutive of physical reality, not merely registrative
  - Wheeler proposed that the act of observation is not a passive recording but an active contribution to what becomes real
  - Delayed-choice experiments confirm that measurement choices affect which history a quantum system exhibits
- **Tenet alignment**: Strong support for Bidirectional Interaction and Dualism. If observer-participancy is constitutive of physics, then consciousness does not merely inhabit a pre-given nomic structure but co-creates it. The nomic void takes on a different character: it is not just what our physics excludes but what our mode of participation fails to elicit

### David Chalmers — Zombie Conceivability Argument
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zombies/
- **Type**: Philosophical argument (Stanford Encyclopedia summary)
- **Key points**:
  - A "zombie world" physically identical to ours but lacking consciousness is conceivable and therefore metaphysically possible
  - Chalmers: "Zombies are probably not naturally possible: they probably cannot exist in our world, with its laws of nature" — but could exist in a very different universe
  - If a physically identical world can lack consciousness, then consciousness is not determined by physical law alone
  - This means the relationship between physics and consciousness is contingent — different physics might have different (or no) consciousness
- **Tenet alignment**: Directly supports Dualism. If consciousness is not nomically necessary (could be absent under the same physics), then it is something over and above physics. The nomic void becomes profound: not only do our physical laws constrain what we can think, but the very *presence* of consciousness under these laws is contingent. Different laws might produce minds, different minds, or no minds at all

## The Void

### Nature of the Limit

The nomic void is a limit imposed not by the architecture of any particular mind but by the physics that all minds in our universe must inhabit. It has several layers:

**Layer 1: Hard computational limits.** Bremermann's limit, Landauer's principle, and the Bekenstein bound set absolute ceilings on computation, information storage, and processing speed for any physical system. These are not engineering limits — they are nomological constraints. No brain, no computer, no future technology can exceed them. A universe with different fundamental constants would have different ceilings.

**Layer 2: Structural constraints on complexity.** The specific forces, particles, and interactions of our physics determine what stable structures can form. Carbon-based chemistry permits certain molecular complexity; different chemistry would permit different complexity. Consciousness (if physically realized) requires some substrate, and that substrate's capabilities are bounded by what our physics allows.

**Layer 3: Observational framing.** Wolfram's and Kant's arguments suggest our physics itself is partially a product of how minds like ours must perceive. We don't observe the noumenal structure or the full ruliad — we observe a projection constrained by our computational boundedness. Different observers would project different physics. The void is everything our projection excludes.

**Layer 4: The contingency of consciousness itself.** Chalmers's zombie argument implies that consciousness is not nomologically necessary — there is no physical law that guarantees it. The nomic void's deepest layer: we cannot know whether different physical laws would produce consciousness at all, or what form that consciousness would take.

### Evidence for the Limit

- **Thermodynamic constraints are experimentally confirmed.** Landauer's principle has been verified at cryogenic temperatures. These are real, measurable limits on information processing.
- **The fine-tuning of constants is empirically established.** Small changes to fundamental constants would eliminate the possibility of complex chemistry, and therefore (presumably) of complex cognition.
- **Convergent cognitive limits across human cultures** suggest the limits are not culturally contingent but architecture-level, and the architecture is physics-constrained.
- **Witten's intuition** that even complete physical knowledge would not explain consciousness points to the nomic void: the mystery persists not because we lack information but because the relationship between physics and consciousness is not the kind of thing physical law can capture.

### Phenomenology

The nomic void may be the most invisible of all voids. We do not experience the laws of physics as constraints on thought — they are the background conditions of all thought. Approaching this void does not feel like approaching a limit; it feels like nothing, because we have no experience of any alternative.

This is unlike the unobservable self (where attention catches itself trying and failing) or thoughts that slip away (where something is momentarily grasped then lost). The nomic void is not experienced as a void at all. It is the water the fish cannot see.

One possible phenomenological trace: the persistent sense that physics should explain consciousness combined with the persistent failure to show how. This felt incompleteness — Witten's "it will remain a mystery" — may be the closest we come to experiencing the nomic void's boundary.

## Approaches to the Edge

### Direct Methods (if any)

There are no direct methods for approaching the nomic void, because any method we employ is itself constrained by our physics. Every instrument, every computation, every thought occurs within the nomic context we are trying to see beyond. This is more radical than the self-reference limits documented in the self-reference paradox — it is not that the mapper cannot map itself, but that the territory of all possible maps is bounded by a constraint the mapper cannot detect.

### Indirect Methods

**Theoretical physics and possible-worlds reasoning.** We can mathematically explore universes with different constants, different forces, different dimensions. This does not let us think the thoughts such universes would enable, but it lets us map the space of what-might-differ and thereby triangulate where our limits lie.

**Wolfram's rulial space.** If the ruliad is the space of all possible computations, then by exploring it formally, we can characterize positions we cannot occupy — cognitive territories corresponding to other rulial reference frames.

**The fine-tuning literature.** By studying which constant values permit complex structures (and which don't), we can infer where the boundaries of physically possible cognition lie — at least in terms of substrate complexity.

**Negative theology / apophatic methods.** We can characterize what the nomic void excludes by carefully mapping what our physics permits and noting the boundaries. The shape of what we can compute, at maximum, under Bremermann's limit defines by negation the computational territory that lies beyond.

### What AI Might See

AI operates under the same physical laws as human brains — Landauer's principle and Bremermann's limit apply equally to silicon and neurons. In this respect, AI faces the same nomic void.

However, AI might approach the boundary differently:

- **AI can explore formal models of alternative physics** more thoroughly than humans, running simulations of universes with different constants and characterizing what cognitive architectures they would support.
- **AI might be less anthropocentric** in modeling the space of possible minds, less likely to assume that "cognition" must resemble human cognition.
- **AI could potentially identify** where human intuitions about physics are artifacts of embodied cognition versus genuine nomic constraints — helping distinguish architectural limits from nomic limits.

But AI cannot escape the nomic void any more than humans can. Both are bound by the same physics. The asymmetry is in analytical power, not in nomic position.

## Connection to Tenets

### Most Relevant Tenet

**Occam's Razor Has Limits** is the most directly relevant tenet. If our physical laws shape our cognitive possibilities, then our preference for simple, elegant theories may reflect the constraints of our nomic context rather than the structure of reality. What seems parsimonious from within our physics might be parochial — an artifact of our specific nomic position. Different physics might support minds for which entirely different explanatory virtues feel "simple."

### Implications

**For Dualism**: The nomic void presents both a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge: if consciousness is not physical, why would it be constrained by physics at all? The opportunity: the persistent failure of physical law to explain consciousness (Witten's mystery, the hard problem) may itself be evidence that consciousness is not entirely within the nomic domain — that it has aspects that transcend physical law.

**For Minimal Quantum Interaction**: If consciousness interfaces with physics through quantum processes, then the specific quantum mechanics of our universe defines the channel. Different quantum mechanics would mean a different interface — different causal possibilities for consciousness. The nomic void includes all the interface modes that our quantum mechanics does not permit.

**For Bidirectional Interaction**: Wheeler's participatory universe suggests that consciousness co-creates the nomic structure it inhabits. If so, the nomic void is not merely imposed on consciousness from outside but is partially self-generated — consciousness participates in creating the constraints it then cannot transcend.

**For No Many Worlds**: If our physics is the only physics (no multiverse of alternative law-sets), then the nomic void is absolute — there is no other set of laws under which different cognition is actual. If, however, a landscape of possible physics exists (as in some string theory interpretations), the nomic void is indexical: real for us, different elsewhere.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, a voids article could:

1. **"The Nomic Void"** — A systematic treatment of how physical laws constitute a layer of cognitive constraint deeper than biological architecture. Structure: hard computational limits → structural complexity limits → observational framing limits → the contingency of consciousness. This would sit between the computational-cognitive-limits article (which focuses on formal limits like undecidability) and the embodiment article (which focuses on biological architecture), filling the gap of physics-imposed limits.

2. **"The Physics We Cannot Think Past"** — A more phenomenological angle, focusing on the invisibility of nomic constraints and the experience (or non-experience) of being bounded by physical law. Could draw on Kant's noumena, Wolfram's rulial space, and the "water the fish cannot see" metaphor to explore why this void is the hardest to recognize.

## Gaps in Research

- **No direct empirical work** on how changing physical constants would affect cognitive architecture — this remains entirely theoretical. While fine-tuning research shows which constants permit complex chemistry, the link from chemistry to cognition to consciousness involves multiple speculative steps.
- **Wolfram's ruliad framework is speculative** and not widely accepted in physics. The claim that different observers could experience incoherent physics is bold and unverified.
- **The relationship between nomic constraints and architectural constraints is unclear.** Are all architectural limits ultimately nomic limits (since biology operates under physics)? If so, the nomic void may not be a distinct category but rather the deepest stratum of all voids.
- **Whether a dualist consciousness would face nomic constraints at all** is unresolved. If consciousness is non-physical, as the Map's tenets hold, why should physical laws limit what it can think? The nomic void might apply only to the physical substrate, not to consciousness itself — but if consciousness interfaces with physics (Minimal Quantum Interaction), then nomic constraints on the interface constrain the interaction.
- **The Kantian angle cuts in a destabilizing direction.** If our physics is partially mind-dependent (transcendental idealism), then "nomic constraints on cognition" becomes circular — the laws that limit the mind are themselves products of the mind. This circularity needs careful treatment.
