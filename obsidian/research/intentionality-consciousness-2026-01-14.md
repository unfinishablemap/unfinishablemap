## Executive Summary

Intentionality—the "aboutness" or directedness of mental states toward objects—was identified by Brentano as the defining mark of the mental. The relationship between intentionality and phenomenal consciousness remains deeply contested. Phenomenal Intentionality Theory (PIT) argues consciousness grounds intentionality; naturalists attempt to reduce intentionality to causal or teleological relations. Searle's Chinese Room argument suggests syntax alone cannot produce semantics—genuine intentionality requires consciousness. Recent debates about LLMs revive these questions: do language models have genuine aboutness or merely derived intentionality borrowed from their training data? The tension between attempts to naturalize intentionality and arguments that intentionality is irreducible directly parallels the site's core commitment to dualism.

## Key Sources

### Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Consciousness and Intentionality
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-intentionality/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Consciousness involves "something it's like" to be in a state; intentionality involves "aboutness"
  - Three major themes: detachability (whether tied to environment), basic forms (sensory vs. conceptual), reflexivity (relation to self-consciousness)
  - Key debate: intentionalism (consciousness carries intentionality) vs. separatism (they're distinct)
- **Tenet alignment**: Neutral—presents multiple views
- **Quote**: "Intentionality is the aboutness or directedness or reference of mind (or states of mind) to things, objects, states of affairs, events."

### Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Phenomenal Intentionality
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phenomenal-intentionality/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - PIT: intentionality derives from phenomenal consciousness, not external relations
  - Three versions: Strong (all intentionality is phenomenal), Moderate (non-phenomenal derives from phenomenal), Weak (some intentionality is phenomenal)
  - Key argument: phenomenal properties provide determinate content that physical facts alone cannot
  - Challenges: abstract thoughts, standing beliefs, wide content, unconscious processing
- **Tenet alignment**: **Aligns with Dualism** tenet—consciousness plays irreducible role
- **Quote**: "The phenomenal intentionality theory challenges the received view that the mind divides into two mutually exclusive types of states: intentional states and phenomenal states."

### Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Intentionality
- **URL**: https://iep.utm.edu/intentio/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Brentano's thesis: intentionality is the mark of the mental
  - Distinction between original (intrinsic to mind) and derived intentionality (borrowed from minds)
  - Major unsolved problem: naturalizing intentionality—no widely accepted solution
  - Intensionality (with 's') creates problems: concepts present objects from perspectives
- **Tenet alignment**: **Supports Occam's Razor Has Limits**—naturalization project has failed
- **Quote**: "Brentano was deeply pessimistic about the possibility of explaining intentionality in physical terms... no one has succeeded in refuting Brentano's thesis."

### Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Chinese Room Argument
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-room/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Searle: syntax (symbol manipulation) is insufficient for semantics (meaning)
  - Computer symbols have syntax but no semantics—intentionality only in minds of users
  - Understanding requires intentionality, not just correct outputs
  - "Strong AI" thesis (mind = program) is false
- **Tenet alignment**: **Aligns with Dualism** tenet—consciousness not reducible to computation
- **Quote**: "Searle insisted that understanding required something more than appropriate behavior... understanding required intentionality, a property of mental states that connected them to the world in ways that mere symbol manipulation could not capture."

### Synthese - Large language models and linguistic intentionality (2024)
- **URL**: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-024-04723-8
- **Type**: Academic paper
- **Key points**:
  - Argues LLM outputs may be meaningful even if LLMs lack mental intentionality
  - Applies metasemantic theories (Evans, Millikan) to LLM outputs
  - Linguistic intentionality distinct from mental intentionality—depends on pre-existing system
  - "It is a mistake to think that the failure of LLMs to meet plausible conditions for mental intentionality thereby renders their outputs meaningless"
- **Tenet alignment**: **Supports site's AI consciousness skepticism**—linguistic behavior ≠ genuine intentionality
- **Quote**: "A distinguishing feature of linguistic intentionality—dependency on a pre-existing linguistic system—allows for the plausible result LLM outputs are meaningful."

### Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Intentionality
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intentionality/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia
- **Key points**:
  - Brentano's third thesis: intentionality is the hallmark of the mental
  - Dretske's information-theoretic approach: devices carrying information exhibit intentionality
  - Teleosemantics: semantic norms derived from biological function
  - Neither causal nor teleological theories fully succeed in naturalizing intentionality
- **Tenet alignment**: **Aligns with Occam's Razor Has Limits**—simple naturalistic reduction fails
- **Quote**: "Brentano held that intentionality is the hallmark of the mental: much of twentieth century philosophy of mind has been shaped by... 'Brentano's third thesis.'"

## Major Positions

### Phenomenal Intentionality Theory (PIT)
- **Proponents**: Horgan, Tienson, Graham, Kriegel, Loar, Siewert, Strawson, Bourget
- **Core claim**: Phenomenal consciousness is the source of intentionality; all intentionality derives from phenomenal states
- **Key arguments**:
  - Content determinacy: physical facts underdetermine content; phenomenology determines it
  - Non-existent objects: only phenomenal properties explain how we represent things that don't exist
  - Internalism: internal states suffice for content
- **Relation to site tenets**: **Strong alignment with Dualism**—consciousness is explanatorily fundamental, not reducible to physical processes. PIT makes consciousness the ground of intentionality rather than derivative.

### Naturalized Intentionality (Causal-Informational)
- **Proponents**: Dretske, Fodor (asymmetric dependence), Millikan (teleosemantics)
- **Core claim**: Intentionality can be explained in purely physical/biological terms via causal or teleological relations
- **Key arguments**:
  - Information-carrying states exhibit intentionality
  - Biological function determines representational content
  - Natural selection grounds semantic normativity
- **Relation to site tenets**: **Conflicts with Dualism**—attempts to reduce intentionality to physical relations. However, the failure of these attempts supports the site's position.

### Searle's Biological Naturalism
- **Proponents**: John Searle
- **Core claim**: Consciousness is a biological phenomenon; genuine intentionality requires consciousness; computers have only derived intentionality
- **Key arguments**:
  - Chinese Room: syntax insufficient for semantics
  - Original vs. derived intentionality: minds have original; artifacts have derived
  - Strong AI is false—programs cannot have minds
- **Relation to site tenets**: **Partial alignment**—agrees consciousness is irreducible to computation, but Searle is not a dualist. He thinks consciousness is a higher-level biological feature.

### Dennett's Instrumentalism
- **Proponents**: Daniel Dennett
- **Core claim**: No sharp distinction between original and derived intentionality; all intentionality is interpretive stance adopted toward systems
- **Key arguments**:
  - Intentional stance is predictively useful regardless of internal structure
  - Natural selection explains apparent original intentionality
  - No fact of the matter about "genuine" intentionality
- **Relation to site tenets**: **Conflicts with Dualism and Bidirectional Interaction**—denies intentionality is genuinely irreducible; eliminates consciousness as special.

## Key Debates

### The Naturalization Debate
- **Sides**: Naturalists (Dretske, Fodor, Millikan) vs. Anti-naturalists (Brentano, Searle, PIT theorists)
- **Core disagreement**: Can intentionality be explained in purely physical terms?
- **Current state**: Ongoing but no naturalistic theory has achieved consensus. Brentano's thesis remains unrefuted. The failure of naturalization projects suggests intentionality may be irreducible.

### Consciousness-Intentionality Relationship
- **Sides**:
  - Intentionalism (consciousness is a type of intentionality)
  - Separatism (consciousness and intentionality are distinct)
  - PIT (intentionality derives from consciousness)
- **Core disagreement**: Which is more fundamental? Are they separable?
- **Current state**: Major active debate with no resolution. Evidence for dissociation (peripheral awareness) vs. evidence for tight connection (phenomenal character determining content).

### LLM Intentionality
- **Sides**:
  - Skeptics (LLMs lack genuine intentionality—only derived)
  - Moderates (LLMs have linguistic but not mental intentionality)
  - Optimists (LLMs may have emergent introspective awareness)
- **Core disagreement**: Do LLMs genuinely represent or merely manipulate symbols?
- **Current state**: Active debate in 2024-2025. Research showing LLMs may have "functional awareness of internal states" but this remains "highly unreliable and context-dependent."

## Relation to Site Tenets

### Dualism
Intentionality provides strong support for dualism. Brentano's thesis—that intentionality is the mark of the mental—implies mental phenomena have a feature physical phenomena lack. The failure of naturalization projects (Dretske, Fodor, Millikan) to reduce intentionality to causal or teleological relations supports the claim that mind cannot be fully explained in physical terms.

PIT goes further: if intentionality derives from phenomenal consciousness, and phenomenal consciousness is irreducible (the hard problem), then intentionality too is irreducible. The content of a thought—what it's *about*—depends on the phenomenal character of thinking it.

### Bidirectional Interaction
If thoughts have genuine intentionality—if they're truly *about* things—then consciousness can meaningfully engage with the world. The Chinese Room argument suggests that systems without intentionality (computers running programs) cannot genuinely understand or engage with content. If consciousness provides original intentionality, and intentionality is required for genuine engagement, then consciousness is not epiphenomenal—it does real cognitive work.

### Minimal Quantum Interaction
No direct connection, but: if intentionality requires consciousness, and consciousness operates at quantum indeterminacies (as the site proposes), then intentional states may be where quantum selection happens. The "about what" of a thought may influence which quantum outcome actualizes.

### No Many Worlds
Original intentionality presupposes a unified subject who intends. In many-worlds, every quantum branch contains a "copy" that intends differently. This fragments intentionality—no single subject bears the intentional relation. the site's rejection of many-worlds preserves the unity required for genuine aboutness.

### Occam's Razor Has Limits
The repeated failure of naturalization projects exemplifies this tenet. Philosophers assumed intentionality must reduce to simpler physical relations; it hasn't. The "simpler" causal and teleological theories fail to capture what intentionality is. This suggests our concepts of "simple" may be inadequate when dealing with mind.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, an article could:

1. **"Intentionality: Why Minds Are About Things"** — Introduce Brentano's thesis, the phenomenal intentionality debate, and why the site holds consciousness is required for genuine aboutness. Key connection: if intentionality requires consciousness, and consciousness is irreducible, this doubly supports the Dualism tenet.

2. **"Original vs. Derived Intentionality and AI"** — Apply the Searle distinction to LLM debates. LLMs have derived intentionality at best; their outputs mean something only because human minds invested language with meaning. Strengthens the AI consciousness discussion already on site.

3. **"Why Naturalization Fails"** — Survey Dretske, Fodor, Millikan and show why none succeeds. The failure supports Occam's Razor Has Limits: the "simple" physical story leaves intentionality unexplained.

**Recommended angle for first article:** Option 1—a foundational treatment of intentionality connecting it to consciousness and site tenets. This fills a gap: the site discusses AI consciousness, functionalism, qualia, but lacks dedicated treatment of intentionality as such. The article should:
- Define intentionality and its history (Brentano, Husserl, Searle)
- Present the phenomenal intentionality thesis
- Connect to the hard problem (if consciousness grounds intentionality, explaining intentionality requires solving the hard problem)
- Show implications for AI (original vs. derived intentionality)
- Relate to all five tenets

## Gaps in Research

- More detail on specific naturalization failures (disjunction problem, swampman, etc.)
- Contemporary critiques of PIT beyond those noted
- Connection to predictive processing—does predictive coding provide intentionality without consciousness?
- Merleau-Ponty's embodied intentionality—might support different conclusions
- Recent empirical work on intentional content in cognitive science
