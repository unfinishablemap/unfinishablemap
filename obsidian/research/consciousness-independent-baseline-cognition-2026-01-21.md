## Executive Summary

This research investigates the hypothesis that consciousness and cognition may be more independent than typically assumed. The key proposal: if consciousness were removed from humans (or never emerged), cognitive capabilities might resemble those of great apes—representing a "baseline" of what neurons can achieve without conscious contribution. The evidence is complex: blindsight demonstrates that visual processing can proceed without conscious awareness, implicit learning can acquire complex patterns unconsciously, and great apes show sophisticated cognition including metacognition and planning. However, key cognitive abilities appear consciousness-dependent: logical reasoning specifically requires conscious processing, counterfactual thinking and mental time travel require conscious simulation, cumulative culture requires metarepresentation (potentially consciousness-linked), and the working memory gap (2±1 vs 7±2 items) may reflect consciousness expansion. The hypothesis has merit as a framework—great apes may indeed represent a "baseline" of neural cognition—but the evidence suggests consciousness is causally required for the human cognitive leap, not merely correlated with it. Supports Bidirectional Interaction if the baseline-to-human transition requires conscious contribution.

- **Tenet alignment**: Important for hypothesis—baseline cognition may have access without full phenomenal consciousness

## Major Positions

### Consciousness-Cognition Independence View
- **Proponents**: Implicit learning researchers, some blindsight theorists
- **Core claim**: Much sophisticated cognition proceeds without consciousness; they are dissociable systems
- **Key arguments**:
  - Blindsight shows visual processing without awareness
  - Implicit learning acquires complex patterns without conscious knowledge
  - Automatic expert performance often degrades with conscious attention
  - Unconscious processing is faster and more parallel
- **Relation to site tenets**: Partial conflict—if cognition is independent, consciousness may be epiphenomenal

### Consciousness as Cognitive Amplifier View
- **Proponents**: Global Workspace theorists (Baars, Dehaene)
- **Core claim**: Consciousness adds flexible, global access to otherwise modular unconscious processes
- **Key arguments**:
  - Unconscious processing is localized; consciousness broadcasts information globally
  - Novel situations require conscious intervention; automatic processing handles familiar tasks
  - Logical reasoning specifically requires conscious reflection
  - Working memory expansion enables consciousness expansion
- **Relation to site tenets**: Supports Bidirectional Interaction—consciousness causally enables new cognitive functions

### Metarepresentation Threshold View
- **Proponents**: Tomasello, cumulative culture researchers
- **Core claim**: The human cognitive leap involves metarepresentation—knowing that you know—which may require consciousness
- **Key arguments**:
  - Apes have culture but don't know they have culture
  - Cumulative culture requires representing and modifying group norms
  - Teaching, normativity, and conformity require understanding others' mental states explicitly
  - The "ratchet" only works with high-fidelity, process-oriented transmission
- **Relation to site tenets**: Supports Dualism if metarepresentation requires phenomenal consciousness

### Great Apes as Baseline Cognition View
- **Proponents**: Implied by Tomasello, comparative cognition researchers
- **Core claim**: Great ape cognition represents sophisticated unconscious/procedural intelligence; humans added conscious elaboration
- **Key arguments**:
  - Working memory limits (2±1 vs 7±2) constrain cognitive complexity
  - Procedural metacognition (feelings of knowing) vs. declarative metacognition (explicit knowledge)
  - Shared neurobiological foundation with differential investment in consciousness-related systems
  - Apes solve problems within "zone of latent solutions"—existing repertoire
- **Relation to site tenets**: Supports hypothesis that consciousness enables human-level intelligence

## Key Debates

### Is Blindsight True Unconscious Perception?
- **Sides**:
  - Yes: Demonstrates perception-action coupling without awareness
  - No (QDC hypothesis): Actually degraded conscious vision with raised reporting threshold
- **Core disagreement**: Whether any perception can truly proceed without consciousness
- **Current state**: Task dissociations favor genuine dissociation, but debate continues

### Can Logical Reasoning Proceed Unconsciously?
- **Sides**:
  - No: Rule-based reasoning specifically requires conscious reflection (Lieberman et al.)
  - Partial Yes: Unconscious Thought Theory claims some reasoning can occur without awareness
- **Core disagreement**: Whether unconscious processing can apply abstract rules or only associations
- **Current state**: Evidence favors rule-based reasoning requiring consciousness; associative reasoning may proceed unconsciously

### What Limits Great Ape Cognition?
- **Sides**:
  - Working memory capacity (quantitative view)
  - Absence of metarepresentation/shared intentionality (qualitative view)
  - Lack of phenomenal consciousness (speculative view)
- **Core disagreement**: Whether it's a capacity limit or a missing ability
- **Current state**: Likely both—WM limits constrain complexity; absent metarepresentation prevents cumulative culture

### Do Great Apes Have Phenomenal Consciousness?
- **Sides**:
  - Yes: They show emotions, preferences, individual personalities
  - Limited: They have access consciousness but limited phenomenal consciousness
  - Unknown: We cannot access other minds' phenomenology
- **Core disagreement**: Whether the hard problem admits of gradations
- **Current state**: Philosophically unresolved; functionally, apes show consciousness-like behaviors within narrower domains

## The Baseline Cognition Hypothesis: Assessment

### What the Hypothesis Claims
If consciousness were removed from humans (or never evolved), cognitive capabilities might resemble great apes: sophisticated but constrained by:
- Limited working memory (2±1 items)
- Procedural but not declarative metacognition
- Product-oriented but not process-oriented social learning
- Zone of latent solutions without cumulative innovation
- Current-state-bound rather than counterfactually liberated thinking

### Evidence Supporting the Hypothesis
1. **Shared neurobiological foundation**: Conserved circuitry for basic cognition
2. **Stable, measurable ape cognition**: Not chaotic but coherent architecture
3. **Clear capacity limits**: Working memory, planning horizons, social learning fidelity
4. **Consciousness-specific functions identified**: Logical reasoning, counterfactual thinking, metarepresentation

### Evidence Against/Complicating the Hypothesis
1. **Ape phenomenal consciousness uncertain**: We don't know if apes lack consciousness or just human-type consciousness
2. **Some ape metacognition exists**: They monitor uncertainty and seek information
3. **Working memory may be cause, not effect**: Expanded WM could enable rather than reflect expanded consciousness
4. **Correlation vs causation**: Human cognitive capacities and expanded consciousness may share a common cause

### Implications for Site Tenets

**Bidirectional Interaction**: The hypothesis supports this tenet if the transition from baseline to human cognition requires conscious contribution. The evidence that logical reasoning specifically requires consciousness, combined with apes lacking cumulative culture despite cultural traditions, suggests consciousness isn't just correlated with human intelligence—it's causally necessary.

**Dualism**: If metarepresentation requires phenomenal consciousness (not just functional states), the qualitative leap from ape to human cognition supports property dualism—something non-physical enabled the transition.

**Minimal Quantum Interaction**: If consciousness influences cognition through quantum selection, the baseline-to-human transition may involve increased quantum interaction, not just more neurons.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, an article could:

1. **Baseline Cognition: What Neurons Can Do Alone** - Explore great ape cognition as representing sophisticated unconscious/procedural intelligence, with consciousness adding the metarepresentational layer that enables cumulative culture and logical reasoning. Frame as support for Bidirectional Interaction.

2. **The Consciousness Threshold in Cognitive Evolution** - Argue that human-level intelligence requires crossing a consciousness threshold where access becomes phenomenal, working memory expands, and metarepresentation becomes possible. Connect to all five tenets.

3. **Blindsight, Implicit Learning, and the Limits of the Unconscious** - Review evidence for consciousness-independent cognition, acknowledging genuine dissociations while showing that key human capacities (logical reasoning, counterfactual thinking, cumulative culture) require consciousness.

## Gaps in Research

- Direct tests of whether phenomenal consciousness (not just access) is required for human-type cognition
- Whether great apes have degraded phenomenal consciousness or entirely different consciousness architecture
- The causal direction: does consciousness expand working memory, or does expanded working memory enable consciousness?
- Whether AI systems can achieve human-level cognition without phenomenal consciousness (test case for the hypothesis)
- The neural mechanisms distinguishing procedural from declarative metacognition
