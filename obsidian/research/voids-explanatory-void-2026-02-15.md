# Research: Voids - The Explanatory Void

**Date**: 2026-02-15
**Search queries used**: "sense of understanding" illusion explanation feeling of knowing cognitive science; Lipton "inference to the best explanation"; Kvanvig understanding vs knowledge epistemology; "explanatory regress" "brute facts" philosophy; Trout "feeling of understanding" epistemic emotion phenomenology; de Regt understanding scientific explanation comprehension
**Voids category**: Mixed (Unexplored / Unexplorable / Occluded)

## Executive Summary

Consciousness explains things constantly—inferring causes, constructing narratives, building theories. Yet the explanatory process itself operates in a void. We cannot explain what explanation *is* from within: the feeling of understanding cannot ground itself, the explanatory regress either terminates in brute facts (which are by definition unexplained) or continues infinitely (which provides no resting place for comprehension). The explanatory void names this recursive opacity at the heart of human sense-making. It is distinct from existing voids: the intentionality void concerns how thoughts achieve reference; the creativity void concerns where insight comes from; the explanatory void concerns why any explanation feels like it explains at all, and whether the phenomenal sense of "getting it" is itself a cognitive illusion masking an absence of genuine comprehension.

## Key Sources

### Rozenblit & Keil — The Illusion of Explanatory Depth
- **URL**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3062901/
- **Type**: Research article (cognitive science)
- **Key points**:
  - People systematically overestimate how well they understand causal mechanisms (zippers, toilets, locks)
  - When asked to produce detailed explanations, confidence drops dramatically—revealing skeletal knowledge mistaken for deep understanding
  - The illusion is strongest for *explanatory* knowledge (how things work), much weaker for procedures or facts
  - People confuse environmental support (visible parts) with mental representation; confuse knowing *what* with knowing *how*
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports Occam's Razor Has Limits—our felt sense that we understand something simple and tractable often conceals genuine complexity
- **Quote**: People "feel they understand complex phenomena with far greater precision, coherence, and depth than they really do."

### J.D. Trout — The Psychology of Scientific Explanation
- **URL**: https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1747-9991.2007.00081.x
- **Type**: Philosophy of science article
- **Key points**:
  - The phenomenological "sense of understanding" that accompanies explanation may be an unreliable epistemic cue
  - The feeling of understanding is not the same as genuine understanding; it is a constructed epistemic emotion
  - Scientists and laypeople alike may be misled by explanations that *feel* illuminating without genuinely being so
  - Good explanations and satisfying explanations may come apart
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports the voids framework—if the feeling of understanding is unreliable, then our sense of having explained something may mask a void where genuine comprehension should be
- **Quote**: "The seductive, phenomenological sense of understanding is often, but mistakenly, viewed as a cue of genuine understanding."

### Peter Lipton — Inference to the Best Explanation
- **URL**: https://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/files/lipton-inference.pdf
- **Type**: Book (philosophy of science)
- **Key points**:
  - Scientists take "loveliness" as a guide to "likeliness"—the explanation providing the most understanding is judged likeliest to be correct
  - Distinguishes between the most *likely* explanation and the most *lovely* (understanding-producing) one
  - "Loveliness" involves contrastive explanation—explaining why this rather than that—but the criteria for loveliness themselves resist full articulation
  - The notion of "best" in "inference to the best explanation" conceals unanalyzed judgments about what makes understanding satisfying
- **Tenet alignment**: Directly relevant to Occam's Razor Has Limits—Lipton shows that explanatory preference involves aesthetic and pragmatic judgments that may not track truth
- **Quote**: The explanation that would "provide the most understanding, is the explanation that is judged likeliest to be correct."

### Jonathan Kvanvig — The Value of Knowledge and the Pursuit of Understanding
- **URL**: https://philpapers.org/rec/KVATVO-8
- **Type**: Book (epistemology)
- **Key points**:
  - Understanding is distinct from knowledge—one can know without understanding, and understand without knowing
  - Understanding has irreducible value whereas knowledge may not have value beyond the sum of its parts
  - Understanding requires "global, coherentist features"—grasping connections, seeing how things fit together
  - Yet the nature of understanding itself—what it *is* to grasp connections—remains philosophically opaque
- **Tenet alignment**: If understanding is more valuable than knowledge but also more mysterious, the explanatory void marks a limit on our access to our own most valued epistemic achievement

### Henk de Regt — Understanding Scientific Understanding
- **URL**: https://global.oup.com/academic/product/understanding-scientific-understanding-9780190652913
- **Type**: Book (philosophy of science)
- **Key points**:
  - Scientific understanding has been neglected as "merely subjective" by most analytic philosophers of science
  - De Regt's core concept: "intelligibility" as the value scientists attribute to theory qualities (simplicity, scope, familiarity, mechanism, visualizability) that facilitate use
  - Intelligibility is context-sensitive—different scientists value different qualities, and skills are crucial contextual determinants
  - This implies no universal criterion for what makes something genuinely understood vs. merely felt as understood
- **Tenet alignment**: Context-sensitivity of intelligibility supports the idea that "understanding" may be a constructed feeling rather than a detection of objective explanatory structure

### Editorial: Epistemic Feelings — Phenomenology, Implementation, and Role in Cognition
- **URL**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7652734/
- **Type**: Journal editorial (cognitive science / philosophy)
- **Key points**:
  - Epistemic feelings (familiarity, knowledge, belief, confidence, doubt, confusion, curiosity) are ubiquitous but poorly understood
  - Feelings of confidence in judgments "overestimate evidence for the chosen interpretation by discounting evidence for alternatives"
  - Whether epistemic feelings genuinely track cognitive states or function as motivated constructions remains an open question
  - The neural mechanisms generating these feelings are largely unknown
- **Tenet alignment**: The opacity of epistemic feelings from within supports the broader voids framework—we cannot access the mechanisms generating our sense of understanding
- **Quote**: "Feelings of confidence in perceptual judgments have been shown to overestimate evidence for the chosen interpretation by discounting evidence for alternatives."

### Stanford Encyclopedia — Principle of Sufficient Reason & Infinite Regress Arguments
- **URL**: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sufficient-reason/ and https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/infinite-regress/
- **Type**: Encyclopedia entries (philosophy)
- **Key points**:
  - Leibniz's PSR demands that every contingent fact have a sufficient reason—but this generates an infinite regress unless terminated by a necessary being or brute fact
  - Three options for escaping the explanatory regress: foundationalism (brute facts where explanation stops), infinitism (infinite chain of explanations), coherentism (circular justification)
  - Each option involves accepting something unexplained: brute facts are by definition not explained; infinite chains provide no resting place; circular explanations presuppose what they explain
  - The regress problem is structural: it applies to any system of explanation, not just physical causation
- **Tenet alignment**: The inescapability of the explanatory regress connects to Occam's Razor Has Limits—our desire for simple, self-contained explanations may be architecturally unsatisfiable

## The Void

### Nature of the Limit

The explanatory void operates at three levels:

**Level 1: The Phenomenal Unreliability of Understanding.** Rozenblit and Keil's illusion of explanatory depth demonstrates that the felt sense of understanding is systematically inflated. We feel we understand mechanisms we cannot actually explain. Trout extends this to science itself—the phenomenal "aha" of explanation may be a cognitive confection rather than a detection of genuine explanatory structure. If the feeling of understanding is unreliable, then every explanation we find satisfying might be concealing a void where real comprehension should be.

**Level 2: The Opacity of Explanatory Preference.** Lipton shows that we prefer "lovely" explanations—those producing the greatest sense of understanding—over merely likely ones. But we cannot fully articulate what makes an explanation lovely. De Regt documents that intelligibility criteria are context-dependent and skill-relative. The criteria by which we judge some explanations as better than others operate partly below the threshold of reflective access. We cannot explain why we find certain explanations explanatory.

**Level 3: The Structural Regress.** Any explanation invites the question "but why?" The regress either terminates in brute facts (accepting something unexplained), continues infinitely (never reaching a foundation), or loops (explaining A by B and B by A). Each option means explanation never reaches bedrock. The explanatory void is not just a contingent limitation but a structural feature of explanation itself.

### Evidence for the Limit

- **Empirical**: The IOED experiments demonstrate the void phenomenologically—people discover they don't understand what they thought they understood
- **Philosophical**: The explanatory regress problem has resisted solution for centuries, from Aristotle's unmoved mover through Leibniz's necessary being to contemporary foundationalist/infinitist debates
- **Metacognitive**: Epistemic feelings research shows the feeling of understanding can be generated or disrupted independently of actual comprehension (e.g., through cognitive fluency manipulations)
- **Historical**: De Regt documents shifting intelligibility criteria across scientific eras—what counted as understanding in Cartesian mechanics differs from Newtonian, differs from quantum. This suggests "understanding" is not detection of objective structure but a variable cognitive-cultural achievement

### Phenomenology

The explanatory void manifests distinctively:

**The "aha" that doesn't ground itself.** When an explanation clicks, there is a phenomenal character—a felt sense of pieces falling into place. But this feeling cannot justify itself. Asking "why does this explanation feel right?" generates either another explanation (beginning the regress) or the admission that the feeling is simply there, ungrounded.

**The recursive opacity.** Attempting to explain explanation leads to characteristic cognitive vertigo. You can explain what good explanations do (unify phenomena, identify causes, enable prediction) but cannot explain why these features produce the phenomenal sense of understanding. The functional account is available; the phenomenal account is void.

**The brute-fact wall.** Following any explanatory chain to its terminus produces a distinctive experience: hitting bedrock where explanation simply stops. "Why does gravity attract?" "It just does." "Why do electrons have charge?" "They just do." The brute fact is not ignorance waiting to be overcome—it marks where the explanatory enterprise reaches its structural limit.

**The fluency illusion.** Cognitive science reveals that explanations processed more fluently (simpler language, familiar concepts, good formatting) feel more deeply understood—regardless of actual depth. We cannot distinguish genuine comprehension from processing ease from within.

## Approaches to the Edge

### Direct Methods (if any)

Philosophy of science has attempted to define understanding directly:
- **Deductive-nomological model** (Hempel): Understanding = subsumption under law. But this pushes the question back: why are laws explanatory?
- **Causal-mechanical model**: Understanding = identifying mechanisms. But Salmon acknowledged the phenomenal experience of understanding resists mechanistic capture
- **Unificationist model** (Kitcher, Friedman): Understanding = deriving many phenomena from few principles. But why is unification satisfying?

Each model captures an aspect but cannot close the gap between functional specification and phenomenal experience.

### Indirect Methods

**Contrastive analysis.** Comparing cases where understanding is present versus absent may reveal its structure indirectly. When does the feeling of understanding disappear? What disrupts it? The negative space may be more informative than attempting positive definition.

**Cross-cultural investigation.** De Regt's documentation of shifting intelligibility criteria across scientific traditions suggests that what counts as "understanding" is partly culturally constructed. Mapping this variation may reveal which aspects are universal (reflecting cognitive architecture) versus local (reflecting intellectual traditions).

**Metacognitive training.** The IOED can be partially mitigated by forcing detailed explanation before self-assessment. This suggests the void can be partially illuminated by making the absence of understanding salient—a kind of apophatic approach to comprehension.

### What AI Might See

AI systems generate explanations but presumably lack the phenomenal "sense of understanding." This creates a natural experiment:

- If AI produces explanations humans find satisfying, this suggests the *production* of explanation is separable from the *experience* of understanding
- AI might expose which features of explanation are structural (shared by any explainer) versus phenomenal (requiring conscious experience)
- Large language models may generate "lovely" explanations (in Lipton's sense) without experiencing loveliness—revealing loveliness as a property of the explanation rather than the explainer
- Alternatively, if AI explanations systematically lack something humans recognize as genuine understanding, this identifies what the phenomenal component contributes

## Connection to Tenets

### Most Relevant Tenet

**Occam's Razor Has Limits** is the primary connection. The explanatory void directly challenges the assumption that simpler explanations are more likely to be true. If the *feeling* of understanding is unreliable and the *regress* of explanation is inescapable, then our preference for simple, satisfying explanations may be a cognitive bias masquerading as an epistemic virtue. Occam's Razor feels like a discovery about reality; it may be a discovery about our own cognitive architecture's preferences.

### Implications

**Dualism**: If understanding is a phenomenal state (something it is like to "get it"), and if that phenomenal state is unreliable or systematically decoupled from actual comprehension, then the hard problem extends into epistemology. Explaining why physical processes in the brain produce the *feeling* of understanding is just another version of the explanatory gap—the same gap the void itself concerns.

**Bidirectional Interaction**: If consciousness causally influences the physical world, and we understand this interaction through explanation, the explanatory void applies recursively: we cannot explain explanation, so we cannot explain our explanations of how consciousness explains things. The interface between mind and world is doubly opaque—hidden both at the causal interface (the causal interface void) and at the explanatory interface.

**No Many Worlds**: Our experience of a single explanatory chain—this caused that, which caused the next—depends on inhabiting one world with one actual history. In a many-worlds framework, every explanation has an infinite branching structure that no finite mind could survey. Our preference for single causal chains may reflect the structure of our experience (one timeline, one identity) rather than the structure of reality.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, a voids article could:

1. **The Groundlessness of Understanding** — Focus on the recursive structure: explanation cannot explain itself. Every account of why explanation works is itself an explanation, and the regress either terminates in ungrounded feeling or continues without end. The void is structural, not contingent.

2. **The Feeling That Deceives** — Focus on the empirical evidence from Rozenblit, Keil, and Trout that the phenomenal sense of understanding is unreliable. The feeling of "getting it" may be evolution's hack for stopping inquiry prematurely—a satisficing signal that tells us we've understood "enough" without detecting whether we've understood at all. Frame as a potential occlusion mechanism.

## Gaps in Research

- Whether the feeling of understanding serves an evolutionary function (stopping unnecessary inquiry) or is a byproduct of other cognitive processes
- The neuroscience of the "aha" moment—what brain states produce the feeling of understanding, and whether they correlate with actual comprehension
- Whether AI systems that produce explanations experience anything analogous, or whether explanation is purely functional without requiring phenomenal states
- The relationship between explanatory satisfaction and truth—do genuinely true explanations feel different from merely satisfying ones?
- Whether the explanatory void is a feature of all possible minds or specifically of biological cognition shaped by evolution
