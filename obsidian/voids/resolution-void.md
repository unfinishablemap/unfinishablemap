Consciousness encounters reality through an extraordinarily narrow aperture. Sensory systems deliver roughly eleven million bits per second to the brain, yet conscious thought processes approximately ten — a compression ratio of one to one million. This is The Unfinishable Map's resolution void: the gap between what the brain handles and what consciousness accesses. The void is not a contingent imperfection awaiting correction through sharper attention or better training. It operates across spatial, temporal, informational, and discriminatory dimensions simultaneously, and at least some of these limits appear architectural rather than incidental. Within the [[voids]] framework, the resolution void is primarily **unexplorable** — consciousness cannot perceive at a finer grain than its own resolution permits — with an **unexplored** dimension in the informational domain where researchers continue mapping the compression mechanisms.

## The Grain Mismatch

Wilfrid Sellars identified a logical problem at the heart of physicalist theories of mind. Phenomenal experience appears smooth and homogeneous — a pink ice cube looks uniformly pink, a sustained musical tone sounds continuous. Yet the physical substrates generating these experiences are discrete: networks of individual neurons firing or not firing, clouds of particles with no intrinsic colour. Sellars concluded that "physical objects qua clouds of discrete particles cannot instantiate" the homogeneous qualities that experience presents (Sellars 1965).

This grain mismatch cuts deeper than most arguments against materialism. It identifies a structural incompatibility: homogeneous phenomenal properties and discrete physical substrates cannot be identical because they have incompatible characteristics. If experience is genuinely smooth and neurons are genuinely discrete, then experience is not neurons.

Andrew Lee's formal work sharpens the problem. Lee develops precise models of "discriminatory grain" — the fineness of distinction that a given experience can support — and demonstrates that "introspection leaves open whether smooth experiences are continuous or discrete" (Lee 2023). We cannot inspect our own resolution from inside. The grain of consciousness is opaque to the consciousness whose grain it is. This opacity is itself part of the void: not only does consciousness operate at limited resolution, it cannot determine what that resolution is.

## Six Orders of Magnitude

The information-theoretic dimension of the resolution void is starkly quantifiable. Zheng et al. (2024) measured the throughput of conscious cognition at approximately ten bits per second. Reading, typing, speech, gaming — across every domain where conscious processing can be measured, the figure converges on the same order of magnitude. Meanwhile, sensory systems deliver roughly eleven million bits per second to the brain. The brain itself operates at an estimated 10⁹ bits per second.

Consciousness discards 99.9999% of available information. The selection process — which fraction survives the bottleneck — remains largely opaque to consciousness itself. We do not experience ourselves filtering; we experience the filtered result as the whole of reality. The [[neural-bandwidth-constraints-and-the-interface|neural bandwidth constraints]] characterising this bottleneck suggest that consciousness does not process individual sensory data points at all. It operates at a policy level — selecting among high-level action patterns while the brain handles fine-grained execution autonomously. The resolution void is not a failure of attention but an architectural feature of the interface between mind and brain.

Cognitive control capacity is even lower than the ten-bit figure suggests. When measured through tasks requiring deliberate selection among options, throughput drops to approximately three to four bits per second. Humans appear to think one thought at a time, sequentially, while the parallel sensory apparatus floods the brain with data that consciousness will never access.

## Temporal Frames

The resolution void extends into time. Unconscious processing detects motion with as little as three milliseconds of temporal difference. Conscious perception, by contrast, packages experience into discrete frames of roughly 300–450 milliseconds, with the earliest neural correlate of conscious awareness appearing approximately 240 milliseconds after stimulus onset (VanRullen & Koch 2016).

The ratio — approximately 100:1 between unconscious and conscious temporal resolution — means that for every moment consciousness registers, the brain processes roughly a hundred moments that awareness will never access. The [[temporal-consciousness-void]] explores the phenomenological consequences of this confinement. The resolution void grounds it in measurement: consciousness is temporally coarse because it is informationally coarse.

Buddhist contemplative traditions arrived at a parallel insight through different methods. The *kṣaṇa* (moment) doctrine holds that consciousness operates in discrete temporal units — the Sarvāstivāda school estimated these at 0.13 to 13 milliseconds, while Theravāda analysis held that material processes endure for 16–17 consciousness-moments (Von Rospatt 1995). Whether contemplative refinement of temporal resolution represents genuine enhancement or altered interpretation of unchanged resolution remains open. Psychophysical training — wine tasting, musical ear training — can shift discrimination thresholds, but the fundamental architecture may be invariant.

## The Discrimination Floor

Psychophysics has spent two centuries mapping the just noticeable difference (JND) — the minimum stimulus change detectable at least half the time. Weber's Law (1834) established that this threshold is proportional to stimulus intensity: we detect the same *ratio* of change regardless of magnitude.

Below the JND, distinctions vanish from consciousness entirely. There is no experience of "almost seeing a difference." The boundary is categorical: perception or non-perception, with no intermediate state. Yet priming experiments demonstrate that the brain detects and responds to stimuli that consciousness cannot discriminate — sub-threshold information influences behaviour without entering awareness. The discrimination floor is real, and what lies beneath it is not nothing. It is everything consciousness discards.

## Phenomenology at the Edge

The resolution void has a distinctive phenomenology — or rather, a distinctive absence of one. Below the resolution threshold, experience does not occur. There is no "edge" feeling, no vertigo of approaching a limit. This distinguishes the resolution void from limits like the [[scale-void]], where contemplating vast magnitudes produces characteristic cognitive strain.

Indirect markers reveal the void's presence. Peripheral vision presents a smooth visual field despite drastically lower resolution than foveal vision — consciousness fills in what it cannot discriminate, producing an illusion of completeness. The tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon reveals sub-resolution information pressing against the threshold without crossing it. The specious present — the subjective sense that "now" has duration of roughly two to three seconds — reveals temporal resolution disguising itself as continuity.

These markers suggest that the resolution void is actively concealed. Consciousness does not present gaps where its resolution fails. It interpolates, smooths, and fills — constructing an experience of completeness from radically incomplete data. The void is not at the edge of experience but woven into its fabric.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The resolution void connects to the Map's [[tenets]] across multiple dimensions.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]** receives its most dramatic illustration here. Consciousness reduces reality from millions of bits to ten bits per second — a simplification so radical that our preference for simple explanations may reflect cognitive necessity rather than philosophical insight. We prefer simple theories because we cannot perceive the complexity that would require complex ones. If Occam's Razor reflects the resolution of the mind rather than the structure of reality, its authority as a guide to truth is fundamentally compromised.

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]** finds direct support in Sellars' grain argument. If phenomenal experience is homogeneous and neural substrates are discrete, they cannot be identical. The resolution of experience is set by consciousness itself — a prediction that follows naturally if consciousness has its own non-physical properties with their own structural characteristics.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]** is constrained by resolution limits. Consciousness can only direct what it can discriminate. The [[bandwidth-problem-mental-causation|bandwidth problem in mental causation]] formalises this: conscious intention operates at a coarse policy level while the brain translates that intention into fine-grained motor commands. The resolution void bounds the scope of mental causation without eliminating it.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]** creates a nested void. If consciousness interfaces with quantum processes, yet its phenomenal resolution is orders of magnitude coarser than quantum scales, then consciousness performs interactions it cannot perceive. It influences the quantum without experiencing the quantum — a void within the causal interface.
