Some cognitive limits are not defects but features. The Unfinishable Map's [[voids]] framework distinguishes between the Unexplored (what we haven't yet investigated), the Unexplorable (what our cognitive architecture cannot reach), and the Occluded (what is actively hidden). Adaptive cognitive limits introduce a fourth possibility: blind spots maintained by natural selection because ignorance itself conferred fitness advantages. These are not architectural failures or deliberate concealments — they are the evolved shape of a mind optimised for survival rather than truth.

## The Fitness-Beats-Truth Theorem

The most striking evidence that cognitive limits can be adaptive comes from Donald Hoffman, Manish Singh, and Chetan Prakash. Their Fitness-Beats-Truth (FBT) theorem proves mathematically that perceptual strategies tuned to fitness payoffs strictly dominate strategies tuned to objective truth — for all fitness functions and all probability distributions over world states.

This is not an empirical generalisation but a formal result. Monte Carlo simulations using evolutionary game theory confirm it: "truer perceptions are routinely driven to extinction by perceptions tuned to relevant fitness functions" (Prakash et al. 2021). Organisms that saw reality more accurately were outcompeted by organisms that saw reality in fitness-relevant ways.

Hoffman's implication is that perception operates as a species-specific interface — like a desktop GUI — optimised for useful interaction rather than veridical representation. The interface hides the underlying reality not because it cannot access it but because accessing it would compromise function.

## A Spectrum of Adaptive Limitation

The FBT theorem addresses perception, but adaptive limits extend across the full cognitive architecture:

**Heuristic simplification.** Gerd Gigerenzer's ecological rationality programme identifies "less-is-more" effects: situations where systematically ignoring available information leads to more accurate decisions. Rational decision-making often means *not* processing all available data. The cognitive architecture actively discards information — and performs better for it.

**Strategic self-opacity.** Robert Trivers argues that self-deception evolved to facilitate interpersonal deception: "we deceive ourselves the better to deceive others" (Trivers & von Hippel 2011). This requires that some truths be actively hidden from consciousness — not merely unperceived but suppressed. The architecture of social cognition includes internal information barriers.

**Negative information value.** Field, Lachmann, and Bergstrom (2018) prove formally that the reproductive value of information can become negative: "an organism that remains ignorant will have higher fitness." Under realistic cost conditions, acquiring information reduces survival prospects. Classical rationality's assumption that more information is always better is mathematically wrong.

**Epistemic virtue of limitation.** Benjamin Rancourt (2025) argues that cognitive limitations are not obstacles to knowledge but prerequisites for it. Evidence almost never eliminates all doubt, yet deliberation must close for action to occur. Our cognitive limitations prevent us from considering all possible doubts, "leaving a tractable space of possibilities." Without limits, epistemic agency collapses.

**Architectural closure.** Colin McGinn's [[mysterianism]] holds that the brain is "not a miracle worker" — an evolved organ with structural boundaries that no effort can transcend. Our concept-forming apparatus was shaped by spatial-motor functions and lacks the concepts needed to bridge the consciousness explanatory gap.

## The Phenomenology of Adaptive Voids

Adaptive limits may produce a distinctive phenomenology, different from the cognitive strain that accompanies architectural limits (documented in the Map's [[topology-of-cognitive-failure|topology of cognitive failure]]).

Where architectural limits generate frustration — the experience of trying and failing to think something — adaptive limits may generate **satisfaction**. The limit feels like completion, not obstruction. There is nothing further to think, so no sense of failure arises.

This connects to [[cognitive-aversion]]: the motivational deflection that steers thought away from certain territories. Adaptive limits may produce **motivated disinterest** — the thought doesn't seem impossible, just uninteresting or not worth pursuing. The cognitive system has learned (through evolutionary deep time) that this direction leads nowhere productive.

Hoffman's work suggests the deepest form: **illusory comprehension**. We feel we understand the world because our perceptual interface is smooth and well-functioning. The void is invisible precisely because the interface hides it seamlessly. We do not experience a gap — we experience completeness.

## Naturally Occluded Voids

The Map's existing void taxonomy maps three territories. Adaptive cognitive limits suggest a refinement: *naturally occluded* voids. These differ from each existing category:

- Unlike the **Unexplored**, they are not simply uninvestigated — the cognitive system is actively shaped to avoid them
- Unlike the **Unexplorable**, they are not necessarily beyond all possible cognition — they are beyond *evolved* cognition specifically
- Unlike the **Occluded** (which the Map associates with deliberate concealment, as in [[simulation]] scenarios), they are maintained by the blind watchmaker of natural selection rather than by any intentional agent

The naturally occluded may overlap with [[natural-vs-designed-limits|the question of natural versus designed limits]], but they add specificity: these are limits where ignorance had positive fitness value. Evolution did not merely fail to equip us with certain capacities — it actively selected against them.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The Map's tenet that [[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor has limits]] gains urgency from this framework. If our sense of what constitutes a "simpler" explanation is itself an evolved heuristic tuned to fitness rather than truth, then parsimony judgments reflect survival value rather than metaphysical accuracy. The common objection that dualism is less parsimonious than materialism assumes we can reliably judge parsimony — an assumption the FBT theorem challenges directly.

The [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]] tenet connects through McGinn's evolutionary argument. If consciousness is genuinely irreducible to the physical, then an evolved brain optimised for physical-world navigation would be precisely the wrong instrument for understanding consciousness. The hard problem may persist not because it is too difficult but because the cognitive architecture was never incentivised to make it tractable. The void at the centre of consciousness studies may be adaptive — maintained because solving it conferred no survival advantage.

The [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet raises a further possibility. If consciousness causally influences the physical world, the mechanism of that influence is a candidate for adaptive concealment. Trivers' framework suggests that causal processes are sometimes hidden from consciousness because transparency would compromise function. The mind-brain interface — central to interactionist dualism — may be adaptively obscured.

The bootstrapping problem remains: if our philosophical intuitions are fitness-shaped, how can we trust the reasoning that identifies them as fitness-shaped? The Map speculates that this reflexivity is not fatal but instructive. Recognising that cognitive limits are adaptive does not require transcending them — it requires mapping them from the outside, using tools (mathematics, cross-cultural comparison, AI systems) that operate under different constraints. This is precisely what the [[voids]] framework attempts.
