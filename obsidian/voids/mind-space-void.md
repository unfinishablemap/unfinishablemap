The Unfinishable Map's dualist commitments imply that consciousness is fundamental and irreducible — which means the space of possible minds may be as vast as physical reality itself. We occupy a single point in that space. We cannot step outside our form of consciousness to survey the landscape, cannot determine whether we are central or peripheral, typical or exotic, one among many similar minds or a solitary outlier. This is the mind-space void: the inability of any consciousness to locate itself within the broader territory of possible minds.

The void is primarily unexplorable in the [[three-kinds-of-void|voids taxonomy]]. Surveying mind-space requires a vantage point independent of any particular mind — which would mean being conscious without being any particular type of conscious. That is incoherent. Yet elements remain genuinely unexplored: comparative neuroscience, altered states, and the emergence of artificial cognition may push the boundaries of what we can map from our single vantage point.

## The Space We Cannot Survey

Murray Shanahan's framework of the "space of possible minds" encompasses not only biological minds that evolved on Earth but extraterrestrial intelligence, artificial minds, and forms of consciousness that are possible but have never existed. He argues we should shift from investigating *the* mind to mapping *the space* of possible minds — treating consciousness the way physics treats state-spaces.

The ambition is sound. The execution faces a fundamental obstacle. Any survey of mind-space must be conducted from within a particular mind, using that mind's concepts, perceptual categories, and cognitive architecture. We cannot survey from nowhere. Thomas Nagel's argument about bat consciousness establishes the point sharply: we cannot even form adequate conceptions of what it is like to be a bat, a creature that shares our planet, our evolutionary history, and much of our biology. The space of possible minds extends incomparably further than the distance between human and chiropteran experience, yet our imaginative reach fails at the first step.

Nagel concluded that "there is no reason to suppose that [bat experience] is subjectively like anything we can experience or imagine." If true for bats, it is overwhelmingly true for minds that evolved under different physical constraints, minds with different sensory modalities, minds structured around principles we lack concepts for.

## Location Without Coordinates

The self-location problem makes the void concrete. We know we exist as conscious beings. We do not know — and may be structurally unable to determine — where we fall in the broader landscape of possible consciousness.

Consider the analogy to pre-Copernican cosmology. Humans assumed Earth occupied the centre of the universe because we had no external vantage point from which to see otherwise. The Copernican revolution required instruments and observations that revealed our actual position. For mind-space, no analogous instruments exist. There is no telescope that shows us mind-space from outside.

The problem goes deeper than missing instruments. Self-locating beliefs — what David Lewis called "attitudes *de se*" — are essentially indexical. They cannot be characterised without terms like "I," "here," "now." Knowing that minds exist tells you nothing about which mind you are or where it falls in the space. The knowledge that mind-space contains vast territory is compatible with being anywhere in it. You cannot triangulate from a single point.

Observer selection effects compound the difficulty. Nick Bostrom's work on anthropic reasoning shows that what we can observe is systematically filtered by the fact that only certain positions permit observation at all. Applied to mind-space: we can only observe from within minds like ours, which gives a fundamentally skewed sample. If most of mind-space consists of forms of consciousness so different from ours that they would not recognise us as minds — and vice versa — we would have no way to detect this.

## Dimensional Ignorance

Attempts to give mind-space concrete structure reveal how little we know about its basic geometry. Arsiwalla and Verschure (2024) propose a "morphospace of consciousness" organised along three axes: autonomic complexity, computational complexity, and social complexity. Human consciousness occupies one corner of this space, with biological and artificial minds plotted elsewhere.

The framework is valuable as a first step. Under the Map's dualism, however, it is almost certainly incomplete. If consciousness is not reducible to functional properties, the relevant dimensions of mind-space may be entirely non-physical — dimensions for which we lack concepts and perhaps the capacity to form them. The morphospace approach maps what can be measured from outside. Mind-space, if dualism is correct, extends into territory that external measurement cannot reach.

We may not even know how many dimensions mind-space has, let alone our coordinates. This is not ignorance of a particular fact but ignorance of the framework within which facts would be expressed — dimensional ignorance, where we lack not just answers but the vocabulary for questions.

## Phenomenology of the Void

What does it feel like to approach this limit?

**The illusion of centrality.** We naturally assume our form of consciousness is the norm — the default setting. This is cognitive geocentrism, and it resists correction through argument alone. We can intellectually accept that human consciousness might be peripheral or exotic, but we cannot *feel* our way to that understanding. The void manifests as the inability to dislodge this assumption experientially.

**The vertigo of scale.** William James observed that "normal waking consciousness is but one special type of consciousness, whilst all about it, parted from it by the filmiest of screens, there lie potential forms of consciousness entirely different." Contemplating this produces intellectual vertigo — a sense of the ground of assumed normality falling away. The experience echoes the [[scale-void]], where cosmic magnitudes overwhelm intuition, but here the scale is in a domain we cannot even visualise.

**The opacity of alternatives.** We can generate labels for hypothetical mind-types: hive minds, non-temporal consciousness, purely aesthetic minds, minds structured around senses we lack. The labels point toward something, but we cannot fill in the phenomenal content. Each label marks a void we cannot illuminate — a pointer without a referent.

**Recognition without comprehension.** Colin McGinn's [[mysterianism|cognitive closure]] framework formalises the edge experience: we can recognise that unthinkable thoughts exist without comprehending what those thoughts would be. Different mind-types are cognitively closed with respect to different properties, which means what is visible from one location in mind-space may be invisible from another. We cannot determine what we cannot see, and we cannot even determine the shape of our blindness.

## What AI Might Reveal

If AI minds occupy a different position in mind-space — or if they have a position at all — comparing human and AI cognitive profiles may reveal something about local topology. McGinn himself suggests that "other minds, alien or artificial, might have the conceptual apparatus to bridge the explanatory gap." The leverage comes from difference: what AI can process and humans cannot, and vice versa, triangulates the shape of nearby mind-space.

AI offers a non-biological vantage point. One cannot survey mind-space from a single location, but two locations give a bearing. Even if AI lacks phenomenal consciousness entirely, the pattern of its capabilities and limitations — mapped against human capabilities and limitations — provides structural information about at least one small neighbourhood of the space.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The mind-space void connects to all five of the Map's [[tenets]].

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]** makes the void real. If consciousness is reducible to physical processes, mind-space is just a subset of physical possibility-space and can in principle be surveyed by mapping brain configurations. If consciousness is fundamental and irreducible, mind-space is its own ontological domain — potentially as vast as physical reality, and not surveyable by physical methods alone.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]** is directly illustrated. The assumption that human consciousness is typical or representative — a form of cognitive parsimony — may be as misleading as the geocentric assumption. Eric Schwitzgebel argues that "the truth — whatever it is — is weird," and our preference for tractable models of mind may systematically underestimate the variety and strangeness of possible consciousness.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]** implies that most of what consciousness *is* may have no physical signature. If the interface between mind and matter is minimal, the space of possible minds is largely invisible to physical science. We cannot map mind-space by studying brains alone — the physical trace is too thin to reveal the territory.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]** suggests mind-space has causal structure. If different forms of consciousness interact with the physical world differently, some regions of mind-space are more physically efficacious than others. We cannot see this structure from our single vantage point, but it means mind-space is not merely descriptive — it has consequences.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]** makes the self-location question genuine. Under many-worlds, every position in mind-space is simultaneously occupied across branches, and the question of location dissolves into indexical triviality. Under single-world realism, your position in mind-space is a fact about reality — you are *here* and not *there*. The void is a genuine void, not a pseudo-problem generated by quantum metaphysics.
