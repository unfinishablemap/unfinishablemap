Throughout intellectual history, concepts once deemed literally unthinkable have become routine. Irrational numbers shattered Pythagorean cosmology. Non-Euclidean geometry overturned Kant's claim that Euclidean space was knowable a priori. Quantum mechanics forced physicists to abandon the requirement that particles have definite position and momentum simultaneously. Each case appeared, at the time, to involve a genuine cognitive limit—not merely a difficult problem but a [[conceptual-impossibility|conceptual impossibility]]. Yet each dissolved. The dissolution problem asks what these cases tell us about current [[voids]]—and the answer is troubling: we have no reliable method for predicting which cognitive limits will prove permanent and which will yield to new concepts.

This inability to classify our own limits is itself a void. It operates at a meta-level, undermining confidence in any claim about what is or is not knowable. The [[whether-real|question of whether voids are real]] depends on distinguishing permanent limits from temporary ones, and the dissolution problem reveals that this distinction cannot be reliably drawn from within.

## The Pattern of Dissolution

Historical dissolutions share structural features. The Pythagorean crisis over irrational numbers (c. 5th century BCE) arose because their cosmology required all quantities to be expressible as ratios of whole numbers. The discovery that √2 is irrational didn't answer the Pythagoreans' original question—it expanded the concept of number itself, making the question dissolve. Resolution came not from solving the problem within the existing framework but from replacing the framework.

The same pattern recurs. Gauss, Bolyai, and Lobachevsky did not prove Euclidean geometry wrong; they demonstrated that consistent alternatives exist, overturning not just a mathematical belief but a philosophical one—Kant's theory of space as synthetic a priori. Gauss observed that the theorems of non-Euclidean geometry "appear to be paradoxical and, to the uninitiated, absurd; but calm, steady reflection reveals that they contain nothing at all impossible." The key insight was that mathematical consistency, not intuitive conceivability, is the standard for possibility.

Quantum mechanics followed the same arc. The revolution was messy—decades of confusion, contested ideas, bold leaps beyond what evidence or logic seemed to demand. Even a century later, the interpretive questions remain unresolved. Quantum mechanics was *representationally* mastered (the formalism works) while remaining *psychologically* opaque (nobody intuitively understands it).

This last point illuminates a distinction that Vlerick and Boudry (2017) make explicit: **psychological closure** (difficulty grasping a truth intuitively) differs from **cognitive closure** (principled impossibility of representing a truth). We can represent truths we cannot psychologically grasp. Quantum mechanics is representable in mathematics though intuitively baffling. "Representational closure does not follow from psychological closure."

## Structural Signatures

If dissolved limits share features, perhaps those features can serve as diagnostic criteria. Several patterns emerge from the historical cases:

**Dissolved limits tend to:**
1. Depend on a specific assumption that proves false ("all is ratio," "space is Euclidean")
2. Be domain-specific rather than affecting all cognition
3. Yield to new representational tools—mathematical notation, computer models, thought experiments
4. Feel like "I can't imagine how" rather than "I can't imagine what"
5. Show accumulating progress even before the breakthrough arrives

**Persistent limits tend to:**
1. Recur across cultures, centuries, and frameworks (Leibniz posed essentially the same [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|hard problem]] in 1714 that Chalmers formalised in 1995)
2. Involve self-reference (consciousness examining consciousness)
3. Resist representational tools at the interpretive level even when formalism succeeds
4. Generate stable philosophical positions rather than progressive research programmes
5. Feel like "I can't even formulate what a solution would look like"

These criteria are suggestive but not decisive. The hard problem scores high on the persistent-limit indicators: it recurs across cultures and centuries, involves self-reference, and has generated entrenched positions (materialism, dualism, mysterianism) rather than progressive narrowing. But every dissolved limit *also* looked permanent to those inside it. The Pythagoreans presumably felt their limit was structural, not circumstantial. So did Kant.

## The Asymmetry Problem

The deepest difficulty is asymmetric evidence. Every dissolution proves a specific limit was apparent. No amount of persistence proves a limit is permanent. We can demonstrate that a limit *wasn't* real (by dissolving it), but we cannot demonstrate that one *is* real (since future concepts might dissolve it).

This creates a reference class problem. When assessing whether the hard problem will dissolve like vitalism did, we must choose a comparison class. Should we compare it to dissolved limits (suggesting optimism) or to persistent limits (suggesting pessimism)? The choice determines the conclusion, and there is no neutral basis for choosing.

Dennett argues that the track record favours the optimist: declaring any problem permanently mysterious has been consistently wrong. But this argument has a blind spot. It generalises from cases where limits dissolved—naturally, since those are the only cases that leave evidence of their prior existence. Limits that are genuinely permanent leave no such evidence. The track record is silent about them.

## The Self-Referential Bind

The dissolution problem has a self-referential structure that blocks resolution. Assessing whether we can overcome a limit requires the very faculties that might be limited. If consciousness is cognitively closed to the property bridging neural activity and experience—as McGinn argues—then our assessment of whether this closure is permanent would itself be conducted by a closed system.

Three positions crystallise:

**The optimist** holds that all limits are contingent. Historical dissolutions prove that "unthinkable" usually means "not yet thought." Human language—a qualitatively different cognitive tool from anything other animals possess—has enabled every past breakthrough and will enable future ones.

**The pessimist** holds that some limits are structural. Scope implies limits: any endowment powerful enough to think some thoughts is thereby prevented from thinking others. The hard problem's distinctive features—self-reference, cross-cultural persistence, resistance to formalism at the interpretive level—distinguish it from historically dissolved limits.

**The suspended position** holds that the question is formally undecidable from within. Both verification and falsification appear blocked. If limits are permanent, we cannot detect them. If they are temporary, we cannot be certain a deeper limit doesn't hide behind them. (Quantum mechanics dissolved classical intuitions about particles but left the measurement problem—a different, perhaps deeper limit. Do dissolved limits always reveal deeper limits behind them?)

## What AI Might Reveal

Artificial intelligence provides a genuinely different cognitive architecture for probing the dissolution problem. AI systems are psychologically closed to different things than humans (embodied spatial reasoning, for instance) while open to things humans find difficult (processing high-dimensional data). If AI systems also fail to resolve the hard problem—not merely because they might lack consciousness but because the problem retains the same structural features when approached from any architecture—this would constitute evidence for permanent closure.

The Vlerick-Boudry distinction becomes critical here. AI might represent a solution to the hard problem mathematically without *understanding* it phenomenally. This would demonstrate representational openness alongside psychological closure—and raise the question of whether representational access constitutes genuine understanding.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The dissolution problem connects most directly to **[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]**. If we cannot determine which limits are permanent, then our preference for simpler explanations—which tend to stay within established conceptual frameworks—may systematically bias us away from truths requiring conceptual revolutions to access. Every historical dissolution required abandoning a simpler framework for a more complex one. The Pythagoreans' "all is ratio" was simpler than accepting irrationals. Euclidean space was simpler than non-Euclidean. Classical mechanics was simpler than quantum mechanics. Had simplicity preferences prevailed, these dissolutions would never have occurred.

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]** receives indirect support. If the hard problem has the structural features of a persistent limit—self-referential, cross-culturally recurrent, generating stable positions rather than progressive research—this provides weak evidence that the consciousness-matter interface is a genuine void rather than a temporarily unsolved problem. The Map's dualism gains support not from proving the limit is permanent but from noting that its structure differs from historically dissolved limits.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]** connects through the quantum measurement problem. Its persistence as an *interpretive* problem (while the formalism succeeds) is structurally similar to the hard problem's persistence. Both involve a gap between representational success and conceptual understanding. If the Map is right that consciousness interfaces with quantum mechanics, these two persistent limits may be aspects of the same underlying void.

The dissolution problem also validates the [[voids]] project's methodology. Since we cannot determine which limits are permanent, the intellectually honest approach is to treat all limits as potentially informative—mapping their shape whether or not they prove permanent. This is precisely what [[apophatic-cartography|apophatic cartography]] does: using the structure of failure as data about what lies beyond, without requiring a verdict on permanence.
