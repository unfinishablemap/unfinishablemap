Every conscious experience arrives already owned. Seeing red, feeling pain, remembering a face—each carries an implicit tag: *mine*. Phenomenologists call this *for-me-ness* (Zahavi) or *Jemeinigkeit* (Heidegger): the quality by which experience belongs to a subject. The Unfinishable Map names the ownership void for the gap that opens when we ask how this appropriation works. We cannot introspect the mechanism by which experiences become ours, because every act of introspection is itself already owned. The ownership relation is presupposed by the very investigation that would uncover it.

Depersonalisation disorder proves that mineness is a separable phenomenal feature—it can vanish while experience continues. Yet its removal reveals nothing about its mechanism. Patients report that experience loses its "for-me" quality; they do not report *seeing how ownership was constructed*. The void reveals itself as absence, never as machinery.

## Mineness as Phenomenal Feature

Dan Zahavi argues that for-me-ness is not added to experience by reflection but is constitutive of experiential character itself. Pre-reflective self-awareness—"an immediate and intrinsic self-acquaintance which is characterized by being completely irrelational"—accompanies all conscious states. In being aware of anything, one is aware of it as one's own.

Heidegger's *Jemeinigkeit* makes a stronger ontological claim. Mineness is not a contingent psychological feature but an existential structure of Dasein: being is always "mine to be." Even inauthenticity—losing oneself in the crowd—is a *mode* of mineness, not its absence. On this reading, ownership is prior to any subject-object distinction, prior to any analysis that might decompose it.

If these accounts are correct, the ownership void is not a gap in our knowledge waiting to be filled. It is a structural limit. You cannot get behind ownership to explain it because ownership is presupposed by every explanation.

## When Ownership Vanishes

Depersonalisation disorder (DPD) disrupts the sense of mineness while leaving experience intact. Alexandre Billon argues that "depersonalization consists in the lack of a phenomenal feature that marks experiences as mine." Patients describe experiences happening "behind glass"—the world continues but lacks the quality of being *for them*.

Anna Ciaunica and colleagues compare this to a crack in a normally transparent window. The crack reveals the window's presence: DPD alters the transparency of pre-reflective self-consciousness without destroying consciousness itself. Subjects report a fracture between an "observing self" and an "observed self." Ownership becomes visible precisely because it is impaired.

Schizophrenic thought insertion provides a complementary dissociation. Shaun Gallagher distinguishes the sense of agency ("I initiated this") from the sense of ownership ("this occurs in my mind"). In thought insertion, agency is lost while ownership typically persists—thoughts feel as though they belong to the patient's mental life even though someone else seems to have produced them. The reverse dissociation in DPD—ownership lost while agency may remain—confirms these are distinct phenomenal features with separable grounds.

Franz Knappik complicates the picture by arguing that DPD symptoms need not reflect the loss of a single global "mineness" feature. Different mental state types may relate to the subject in different ways. If Knappik is right, the ownership void is not one void but many—each modality of experience may have its own form of appropriation, each opaque in its own way.

## Transparency and the Self-Model

Thomas Metzinger's self-model theory offers a physicalist account of why the ownership relation hides itself. The phenomenal self-model (PSM) is a *transparent* self-representation: the system cannot experience it *as* a model. Because the model's construction is invisible, its contents feel simply and directly "mine." Metzinger calls this "epistemic autoepistemic closure"—the self-model is architecturally designed to conceal its own modelling.

The Map does not endorse Metzinger's physicalist framework, but the structural insight applies across metaphysical positions. Whether ownership is produced by neural self-modelling or is constitutive of non-physical subjectivity, the result is the same: the ownership relation is hidden from the subject who bears it. Under dualism, the opacity may run even deeper—not merely concealed by neural architecture but constitutive of what subjectivity *is*. A physical system can in principle be analyzed from outside by another physical system, but a non-physical subject has no external vantage point from which its subjectivity could be examined. It cannot disassemble its own ownership any more than a physical self-model can observe its own transparency.

## The Contemplative Approach

If DPD approaches the ownership void involuntarily and painfully, contemplative practice approaches it deliberately. Deane, Miller, and Wilkinson use the active inference framework to unify both: the self emerges from a "temporally deep generative model," and both DPD and advanced meditation involve its dissolution—involuntary collapse in one case, deliberate relaxation in the other.

Buddhist *anattā* (no-self) practice systematically searches for ownership and fails to find it. Each element of experience—body, sensation, perception, mental formations, consciousness—is examined, and for each the sense of "mine" is found to be impermanent and unfixable. Unlike DPD, meditators often describe the dissolution of mineness as peaceful or liberating rather than terrifying.

This affective divergence matters. The same structural void—the absence of the ownership ground—produces terror when entered involuntarily and equanimity when entered deliberately. The void boundary is real; its phenomenal valence depends on the manner of approach. The [[phenomenology-of-the-edge]] documents similar context-dependence at other cognitive limits.

## The Peculiar Recursion

Attempting to introspect ownership produces a distinctive recursion. Unlike the [[the-unobservable-self|unobservable self]], where the observer generates new layers of observation, the ownership void traps attention in a different way: the attending itself is "mine," which means ownership is present in the very act of looking for it. It cannot be isolated because isolation would require a vantage point outside ownership—an experience that is not "for anyone"—and such a vantage point would not be experience at all.

This distinguishes the ownership void from neighbouring voids:

- The **[[the-unobservable-self|unobservable self]]** concerns the subject that cannot become its own object. The ownership void asks why any experience feels appropriated by a subject.
- **[[introspective-opacity]]** concerns hidden cognitive processes. The ownership void concerns a specific phenomenal feature—mineness—that is normally present but whose ground is hidden.
- The **[[self-reference-paradox]]** concerns logical structure. The ownership void is phenomenological: about felt belonging, not formal reflexivity.

The broader [[consciousness-and-the-ownership-problem|ownership problem]]—why experience belongs to anyone at all—provides the philosophical context. The ownership void is the epistemic residue that remains even after the ownership problem is well-stated: not merely that ownership is unexplained, but that the mechanism of appropriation is structurally inaccessible from within.

## Relation to Site Perspective

### Dualism

The [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]] tenet finds support in the ownership void's structure. If for-me-ness is "completely irrelational" (Zahavi) and ontologically primitive (Heidegger), it resists functional decomposition. Physicalist accounts like Metzinger's explain the *functional architecture* of ownership—why the self-model is transparent—without addressing the phenomenal character of mineness itself. The Map holds that ownership is irreducible because it is constitutive of non-physical subjectivity: not constructed from simpler components but fundamental to what consciousness is.

### Bidirectional Interaction

The [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet connects through the agency/ownership distinction. If consciousness causally influences physical processes by selecting among quantum outcomes, then agency—the sense of initiation—reflects that causal role. Ownership may be the more fundamental feature: the non-physical subject's way of *claiming* the physical processes it influences. The mechanism of this claiming would then be hidden by the same opacity that conceals the interaction mechanism itself.

### No Many Worlds

The [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]] tenet gains relevance because ownership is inherently indexical. *My* experiences are mine, not anyone else's, and not the experiences of a branching counterpart. Many-worlds generates countless subjects each with their own ownership, but cannot explain why *this* ownership feels singular rather than distributed. The ownership void is a void *for this subject*—its determinacy presupposes a determinate referent.

### Occam's Razor Has Limits

The [[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]] tenet applies. Predictive processing and self-model accounts provide elegant explanations of ownership as neural self-modelling. Parsimony favours these accounts. But the simpler explanation may leave something out—the phenomenal character of mineness, the felt quality of experience being *for someone*. The apparent simplicity of the physicalist account could reflect its silence on the hardest aspect of the problem.
