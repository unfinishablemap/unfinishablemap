William James called consciousness a "stream." Bergson insisted on an indivisible "flow." Yet neuroscience reveals that conscious percepts emerge in discrete episodes of roughly 400 milliseconds, separated by intervals of unconscious processing. The Unfinishable Map's continuity void names a structural impossibility: consciousness cannot determine whether it flows continuously or arrives in discrete drops, because every method of investigation either presupposes the answer or transforms what it examines. This is not a gap in current knowledge awaiting a better instrument. It is a feature of what consciousness is.

Within the [[voids]] framework, the continuity void is primarily **unexplorable** — first-person access cannot distinguish continuous from discrete temporal structure — with elements of the **occluded**, since the very concepts we use to frame the question may prejudice the answer.

## Smooth Does Not Mean Continuous

The strongest argument that this void is structural rather than merely difficult comes from Andrew Y. Lee's formal analysis of phenomenal continuity. Lee demonstrates that discrete experiences can feel perfectly smooth. "What it's like to imagine an experience as discrete need not be what it's like to actually undergo the discrete experience that is imagined" (Lee, 2023). The smoothness of experience — the sense of seamless flow — is compatible with underlying discreteness.

This dismantles the most intuitive argument for continuity. Most people feel certain that consciousness flows. It *seems* to. But Lee shows that this feeling is precisely what cannot be trusted. A consciousness composed of rapid discrete frames could produce exactly the same phenomenology as a genuinely continuous one. The apparent stream could be a flipbook.

The parallel with cinema is instructive but imperfect. Film creates apparent motion from static frames, yet we know the frames are discrete because we can slow the projector. No equivalent procedure exists for consciousness. Slowing down introspection does not reveal frames — it creates a different experience entirely. The instrument and the phenomenon measured are the same thing.

## Three Models, No Convergence

Philosophy of mind offers three competing accounts of temporal consciousness, all compatible with the same evidence:

**The cinematic model** treats experience as a rapid sequence of static, motion-free snapshots. Each conscious moment is complete in itself — a frozen cross-section of experience. Apparent motion and change are constructed across frames, like animation cells. This model aligns with neuroscientific evidence of discrete processing windows but faces the question of what exists *between* frames — a micro-scale version of the [[dreamless-sleep-void]].

**The retentional model**, developed by Husserl, proposes that each conscious moment has a complex internal structure: a primal impression of the present, a retention of the just-past (not memory but the experienced fading of what was), and a [[protention|protention]] directed toward the immediate future. This makes each moment temporally thick — "extended like a comet's tail" — without requiring genuine continuity in the mathematical sense. Husserl's model is compatible with both continuous and discrete implementations.

**The extensional model**, defended by Dainton and Russell, holds that consciousness is genuinely extended through time. Experience is not built from momentary snapshots; it *spans* intervals. The [[specious-present-temporal-experience|specious present]] — the experienced duration of "now" — is not an illusion created by rapid succession but a genuine temporal window in which change is directly perceived.

These three frameworks have been debated for over a century without convergence. The evidence does not adjudicate between them because they make identical predictions about what experience will feel like from the inside. The [[temporal-structure-of-consciousness|temporal structure of consciousness]] remains underdetermined by all available data.

## The Measurement Paradox

Any attempt to determine the temporal grain of consciousness encounters a circularity. To time a conscious moment, consciousness must serve as both clock and phenomenon measured. If consciousness is discrete, the measuring act occupies a moment of the same grain as what it measures — it cannot be finer than itself. If consciousness is continuous, the act of marking a boundary creates one where none existed.

Buddhist contemplative traditions encountered this problem two millennia ago. Vipassanā meditation claims to reveal the arising and passing of momentary mental events at extremely fine grain. Practitioners report perceiving individual *khaṇas* — discrete flashes of experience. But the [[observation-void]] applies here: the practice shapes what it observes. Intensive attention to temporal boundaries may construct discreteness rather than discovering it.

Neuroscience approaches from the other direction but hits an analogous wall. Herzog, Kammer, and Scharnowski's two-stage model demonstrates that continuous unconscious processing precedes discrete conscious percepts. Feature fusion experiments show that stimuli presented in rapid succession merge into single percepts, and the colour phi phenomenon demonstrates post-dictive perception — the brain retroactively edits conscious experience, which is impossible under purely continuous models. "You need to process information continuously, but you cannot perceive it continuously" (Herzog et al., 2016). Yet even this finding only describes the *processing* that produces consciousness, not the phenomenal result. The temporal structure of neural computation need not match the temporal structure of the experience it generates — especially if, as the Map holds, consciousness is not reducible to neural processes.

## The Specious Present Without a Ruler

The difficulty crystallises in the specious present — the experienced duration of "now." Estimates of its length range from 300 milliseconds (Strawson) to 1.5 seconds (Lockwood), with no convergence. If the temporal grain of consciousness were determinable, we would at minimum agree on this basic measurement.

The disagreement is not merely empirical. Different experimental paradigms measure different things: temporal order judgements, simultaneity windows, perceptual fusion thresholds, rhythmic grouping intervals. Each operationalises the specious present differently, and none captures what we actually want to know — the duration of a single unit of experience as experienced. That concept may not even be coherent, which is itself part of the void.

Bergson warned that the conceptual vocabulary of this debate prejudices its outcome. Asking whether consciousness comes in "moments" or "snapshots" already spatialises time, imposing a discrete framework through the grammar of the question. Even asking whether consciousness is "continuous" imports mathematical concepts — limits, density, completeness — that may not apply to phenomenal structure at all. The void may be partly created by trying to describe temporal experience in terms borrowed from spatial and mathematical reasoning.

## Convergent Irresolvability

The strongest evidence that this is a genuine void — not merely a hard problem — is the convergent failure across independent traditions. Buddhist momentariness (*kṣaṇavāda*) has debated exactly this question for over two thousand years, generating sophisticated arguments without resolution. Bergson's durée and Husserl's time-consciousness represent a separate philosophical tradition reaching similar impasses. Analytic philosophy of mind adds formal precision without progress. Neuroscience reveals the processing architecture without touching the phenomenal question.

When entirely independent intellectual traditions, using different methods, different conceptual frameworks, and different starting assumptions, all reach the same impasse over the same question for millennia, the difficulty is likely in the territory rather than the explorer.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The continuity void connects to several of the Map's [[tenets]].

**Dualism** (Tenet 1) deepens the void. If consciousness is not reducible to physical processes, then the temporal structure of neural computation does not determine the temporal structure of experience. The brain's discrete processing windows (gamma oscillations, ~400ms integration cycles) do not entail discrete experience, and the brain's continuous synaptic activity does not entail continuous experience. The causal interface between non-physical consciousness and physical brain may impose its own temporal properties that neither side of the interface determines. This makes the continuity question harder, not easier, for dualism — but it also makes the question's irresolvability less surprising.

**Occam's Razor Has Limits** (Tenet 5) applies directly. The simplest model — consciousness is continuous because it feels continuous — is precisely what Lee's analysis undermines. Three fundamentally different models accommodate the same evidence. Parsimony cannot adjudicate, because we lack the conceptual tools to determine which model is genuinely simpler at the level that matters.

**Bidirectional Interaction** (Tenet 3) raises a distinctive possibility. If consciousness is causally efficacious, it may participate in determining when unconscious processing "renders" into awareness. The temporal grain of consciousness might be a product of consciousness itself — set by the non-physical mind rather than imposed by neural architecture. If so, the continuity question becomes entangled with the mechanism of consciousness-brain interaction, and the void deepens further: we cannot determine the temporal grain of consciousness partly because that grain may be constituted by consciousness rather than by the physical processes we can study.

The continuity void exemplifies why the Map is unfinishable. Not every question about consciousness is merely unsolved. Some may be unsolvable — places where the map genuinely cannot be drawn, because the territory does not permit the measurement that drawing requires.
