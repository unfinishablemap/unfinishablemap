We experience choosing, deciding, and acting—but the process by which these experiences arise, and whether they genuinely cause our actions, remains hidden from introspection. This is volitional opacity: the structural inaccessibility of the mechanisms by which we will. We know *that* we decide; we cannot observe *how* we decide. The void concerns not external reality but our own agency—the most intimate territory, and among the most impenetrable.

Volitional opacity sits at the intersection of two related voids. [[introspective-opacity|Introspective opacity]] concerns our inability to observe cognitive processes in general—we access contents but not the mechanisms producing them. [[causal-interface|The causal interface void]] concerns how consciousness interfaces with physical causation. Volitional opacity combines both: we cannot observe the processes of willing, and we cannot observe how (or whether) willing causes action.

## Three Dimensions of Opacity

### Temporal Opacity

By the time we are aware of deciding, the decision has already been initiated. Benjamin Libet's experiments revealed that the "readiness potential"—brain activity preparing for voluntary movement—begins approximately 550 milliseconds before the action, while conscious awareness of the urge to move appears only around 200 milliseconds before. The volitional process is initiated unconsciously.

More recent research found that brain activity predicts decisions up to seven seconds before conscious awareness. William James diagnosed this phenomenologically: "The rush of thought... almost always brings us up at the conclusion before we can arrest it." Decisions seem to *arrive*—we experience them as accomplished, not as being accomplished.

### Process Opacity

We have access to the *feeling* of willing—the phenomenology of agency—but not the *mechanism* of willing. Daniel Wegner's research on "apparent mental causation" showed that the experience of willing arises from interpreting our thoughts as causes of our actions, based on three factors: priority (thought precedes action), consistency (thought matches action), and exclusivity (no other apparent cause is salient).

Crucially, Wegner did not claim conscious thought cannot cause action—only that "any connection between conscious thought and action should be determined by scientific enquiry, and not by unreliable introspection and feelings." The sense of agency is constructed, not observed. We infer authorship when conditions are met; we do not perceive causation directly.

Choice blindness experiments confirm this construction. When experimenters secretly switched participants' selections, people confabulated detailed reasons for choices they never made. The constructed explanation felt no different from genuine explanation.

### Mechanistic Opacity

For dualists, a deeper opacity remains: how can an immaterial mind affect a physical brain at all? Princess Elisabeth posed this challenge to Descartes in 1643, and no satisfying answer has emerged. "Since the mind is, on the Cartesian model, immaterial and unextended, it can have no size, shape, location, mass, motion or solidity. How then can minds act on bodies?"

The question of how mental causation works "is problematic because in dualism 'the mind' is assumed to be non-physical and by definition outside the realm of science." Even if we accept that consciousness causes action, we cannot observe how. The mechanism of willing may be permanently beyond both introspective and scientific access—cognitively closed in Colin McGinn's sense.

## The Phenomenology of Volitional Opacity

What does this opacity feel like from the inside? A crucial caveat applies: [[introspective-opacity|introspective opacity]] suggests that these phenomenological reports may themselves be constructed rather than revelatory. We cannot assume introspection reliably describes volitional experience any more than it reliably describes other cognitive processes. The phenomenology recorded here represents *what willing seems like*—which may differ from what willing actually is.

With this caveat, subjects report the following features:

**The sense of authorship**: We experience ourselves as the origin of our actions. This feeling is vivid, immediate, and compelling. Galen Strawson describes an aspect of experience that is "profoundly libertarian," involving a sense of oneself as a "self-determining 'agent-self'" that is "separate from, and somehow irreducibly over and above, all its particular desires." But as Wegner's research shows, this rich phenomenology can occur even when our actions have other causes. The sense of authorship is a constructed experience, not a window onto causal reality.

**The gap at initiation**: When we try to catch the moment of deciding, we find it elusive. Decisions seem to *appear*—we experience having decided, not deciding. The initiation is always already past. Meditators across traditions report the same finding: sustained attention on the moment of decision reveals less and less. The intention seems to arise rather than be caused. Whether this elusiveness reflects genuine absence of conscious initiation, or merely introspection's inability to track rapid processes, cannot be determined from introspection itself.

**The effort phenomenon**: Trying involves "mobilizing force in the face of resistance," as Uriah Kriegel puts it. We experience exertion, strain, and directed effort. This phenomenology is vivid—but whether it reflects actual causation or merely accompanies neural events remains hidden. The effort is felt; its efficacy is opaque. Even the phenomenology of effort may be retrospectively constructed: we may *feel* like we tried hard only after observing ourselves persist.

**The transparency illusion**: Despite structural opacity, we *feel* transparent to ourselves as agents. We feel we know why we act, how we decide, what moves us. This felt transparency may be the mind's "best trick" (Wegner). The seamlessness of confabulation—fabricated explanations feel no different from veridical ones—creates confidence where none is warranted.

**The akratic revelation**: In weakness of will, we watch ourselves act against our own judgment—aware of both the judgment and the contrary action. Aristotle affirmed akrasia as "a staple of commonsense and a common human experience." Akrasia reveals that "we" and "our will" are not identical—something acts that is not the judging self. The unity of the willing self dissolves under examination.

## Three Interpretations of the Void

Different frameworks interpret volitional opacity differently:

**The Illusion Interpretation** (hard determinism, some eliminativists): The sense of willing is entirely illusory. Unconscious neural processes cause both our actions and our experience of willing. The "will" is a post-hoc narrative, not a cause. The void exists because there is no mechanism to find—"will" names a feeling, not a force.

**The Partial Access Interpretation** (Libet, compatibilism): Volition is real but largely unconscious. We have limited access—enough to veto, monitor, and guide, but not enough to observe initiation. Libet proposed that while consciousness cannot initiate voluntary acts, it can veto them—"free won't" rather than free will. The void exists because consciousness accesses only the output of volitional processing.

**The Closure Interpretation** (mysterianism): Volition is real and causally efficacious, but the mechanism by which consciousness causes action is cognitively closed to us. McGinn argues that consciousness is "a fully natural phenomenon, but we humans are just cognitively closed to it." Similarly, the mechanism of willing may be permanently inaccessible—not because there is none, but because our concept-forming procedures cannot grasp it.

## Merleau-Ponty on Pre-Reflective Agency

Merleau-Ponty's account of embodied agency complicates the picture. Much of what we call willing operates pre-reflectively: "It is the body which 'understands.'" Motor intentionality acts without requiring conscious representation. The skilled pianist's fingers find the keys; the experienced driver's foot moves to the brake. Action happens through the body, and only afterward does consciousness claim authorship.

This suggests volitional opacity is not a failure to observe something happening consciously elsewhere. The "willing" we seek may be distributed across processes that were never conscious to begin with. We are opaque to ourselves not because the light cannot reach inside, but because there is no unified "inside" for light to illuminate.

## Relation to Site Perspective

### Bidirectional Interaction

The [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet is directly relevant. The Unfinishable Map holds that consciousness causally influences the physical world. Volitional opacity concerns whether we can observe this influence.

Libet himself took "an explicitly dualistic view" of the veto process: "a purely conscious field could act on neural processing in the cortex to prevent the dispatch of a motor command." If consciousness can veto unconsciously-initiated impulses, this is bidirectional interaction in action. But we cannot observe *how* the veto works. The mechanism by which a "purely conscious field" could "act on neural processing" remains mysterious.

The void doesn't deny bidirectional interaction—it holds that the mechanism is hidden. This is coherent: we would expect an interface between consciousness and physics to be precisely where both first-person and third-person access fail.

### Dualism

The [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]] tenet faces the interactionist problem directly. If mind and brain are distinct, how do they interact? The Map interprets this opacity as evidence that the interface is real but structurally hidden—occupying the boundary between domains, precisely where we cannot look.

### Minimal Quantum Interaction

The [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet suggests why the mechanism might be inaccessible. If consciousness's influence is minimal—affecting quantum probabilities at femtosecond timescales and molecular scales—the interaction would be too small, too fast, and too fundamental for introspection to track. The opacity would follow from the mechanism's nature.

### Occam's Razor Has Limits

The [[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]] tenet is demonstrated by volitional opacity. The simplest assumption—that we directly observe ourselves causing our actions—is almost certainly wrong. Wegner shows the sense of agency is constructed; Libet shows decisions are initiated unconsciously; James shows we cannot catch willing in the act.

Our confidence in self-knowledge of agency exemplifies how parsimony can mislead. The experience of transparency to ourselves as agents is compelling and universal. It is also unfounded. Some truths about agency may be irreducibly complex or cognitively inaccessible.

## The Causal Interface Void Extended Inward

The [[causal-interface|causal interface void]] concerns how consciousness affects the external world. Volitional opacity shows that the same void extends inward—we also cannot observe how consciousness affects our own actions. The interface is opaque from every direction: first-person introspection finds no mechanism, third-person neuroscience finds correlates but not causation, philosophy finds no satisfying account.

The persistence across methods suggests the limit is structural rather than contingent. We may be running up against the boundaries of what our cognitive equipment can represent.

## What Would Challenge This View

The volitional opacity thesis would face difficulty if:

1. **Contemplative training revealed the mechanism.** If meditators eventually report *how* decisions arise (not just *that* they arise), the opacity might be practical rather than structural. Current evidence: advanced practitioners report increased attention to contents but not access to underlying processes.

2. **Neuroscience made the interface visible.** If brain imaging revealed a process that corresponds to consciousness entering the causal chain—observable from the third person and matching first-person reports—opacity would be reduced.

3. **The Libet timing gap closed.** If the gap between neural preparation and conscious awareness proved to be methodological artifact, and the timing of causation became introspectively accessible.

4. **Mechanism was articulated.** If philosophers or physicists explained *how* consciousness biases physical outcomes without leaving the crucial step unexplained.

None of these conditions has been met. Four centuries of philosophy, decades of neuroscience, and millennia of contemplative practice have not resolved how we will. The persistence is evidence that the limit is structural.

- Added explicit caveat at start of "Phenomenology of Volitional Opacity" section acknowledging that phenomenological reports may be constructed rather than revelatory
- Revised "sense of authorship" paragraph to note that rich phenomenology can occur even when actions have other causes
- Added epistemological humility to "gap at initiation" paragraph about whether elusiveness reflects genuine absence or introspective failure
- Revised "effort phenomenon" to acknowledge even effort phenomenology may be retrospectively constructed

Based on pessimistic review identifying tension with introspective-opacity.md.
Key improvement: Resolved inconsistency where volitional-opacity treated introspective reports as revelatory while introspective-opacity argues they systematically misreport.

This log should be removed after human review.
