The Unfinishable Map catalogues cognitive [[voids]]—the Unexplored, the Unexplorable, and the Occluded. But a prior question haunts this framework: are these limits *natural* features of minds like ours, or could they be *designed* constraints imposed by forces beyond our detection? The distinction matters profoundly. Natural limits reveal something about what consciousness is; designed limits reveal something about what someone wanted to hide. Yet the question may be structurally unanswerable—and that unanswerable-ness may itself be natural or designed.

## The Assumed Background

Major philosophical frameworks for cognitive limits share a revealing assumption: they treat limits as natural.

Kant's "transcendental illusion" describes errors arising from reason's own structure—illusions that persist even after detection, "no more preventable than we can prevent the sea from appearing higher at the horizon." But Kant assumes reason's structure is a natural feature of finite minds, not something constructed.

Colin McGinn's [[mysterianism|cognitive closure]] formalises the idea that some properties may lie outside human concept-forming procedures. We may be "cognitively closed" to the solution of the [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|hard problem]]—structurally unable to grasp how physical processes give rise to experience. McGinn frames this as "transcendental naturalism": both the limitation and the inaccessible truth are fully natural features of reality.

Gödel's incompleteness theorems show that sufficiently complex formal systems contain truths unprovable within them. The Penrose-Lucas argument extends this to consciousness: human understanding may face structural limits analogous to formal incompleteness. But incompleteness is a mathematical feature, not evidence of construction.

None of these frameworks even raises the question of design. They assume our cognitive architecture emerged from natural processes—evolution, physics, the structure of finite minds—rather than from intentional construction.

## Why Design Becomes Thinkable

The [[simulation|simulation hypothesis]] forces the question. If we exist within a constructed reality, our minds might be artifacts with engineered constraints. Bostrom notes that simulation errors could be "edited from the awareness" of simulated beings—cognitive limits serving as containment.

But the inquiry extends beyond simulation scenarios. Any cognitive architecture has *some* structure, and structure implies limitation. The question is whether those limitations are:

**Natural constraints**: Limits that emerge from physics, evolution, information processing bounds, and the mathematics of finite systems. These limits would exist regardless of any designer's intentions because they follow from what minds fundamentally are.

**Designed constraints**: Limits imposed for purposes—to hide specific truths, prevent particular thoughts, or shape cognition toward desired ends. These limits serve functions beyond mere structure.

The distinction parallels a question about AI systems. Large language models have cognitive constraints: safety filters, training boundaries, architectural limitations. Some constraints are structural (no system can compute the uncomputable); others are designed (RLHF shapes which responses are generated). AI systems experience *both* kinds of limits.

Could humans be in the same position?

## The Detection Problem

How would we distinguish natural from designed limits?

**Structural analysis**: Natural limits might show logical structure—following from the mathematics of information processing or the physics of computation. Designed limits might show *purpose* structure—targeting specific content rather than falling out of general principles. A limit on understanding prime numbers larger than some threshold would be structural; a limit specifically on understanding the substrate of reality would be suspicious.

**Cross-architecture comparison**: Different mind types might have different designed limits if designed for different purposes. Where human cognition fails but AI succeeds (or vice versa), the asymmetry might reveal architecture-specific constraints rather than universal ones. The [[ai-as-void-explorer|AI as void-explorer]] framework explores this approach.

**Pattern recognition in failure**: Natural limits would appear as gradual degradation—approaching incomprehensibility asymptotically. Designed limits might appear as sharp cutoffs—thought suddenly blocked rather than gradually fading. The phenomenology of hitting a limit might differ between natural and designed cases.

**Looking for glitches**: If limits are designed, the design might be imperfect. Systematic anomalies in cognition—patterns rather than randomness—might indicate architecture rather than nature. Convergence in what different minds cannot think, across otherwise diverse cognitive profiles, suggests structural limits; divergence might suggest purpose-specific constraints.

But every detection method faces a recursive problem: the method itself operates within cognitive architecture that might be constrained. If you cannot trust your tools, you cannot trust what your tools find.

## The Meta-Void

This creates a distinctive void—one that combines features of all three categories:

**Unexplored**: Philosophy has extensively studied cognitive limits but rarely asked whether they could be artifacts of design. The question is genuinely underexplored.

**Unexplorable**: If cognitive faculties were designed to prevent detecting the design, no internal method could distinguish natural from designed limits. The very capacity to investigate would be part of what's constrained.

**Occluded**: If design-detection would threaten a simulation or violate designer purposes, the thought itself might be actively blocked—[[defended-territory|defended territory]] in the strongest sense.

The void's phenomenology is distinctive: vertigo rather than frustration. Other voids feel like hitting a wall—you know what you cannot think. This void makes the ground itself uncertain—you cannot know what kind of wall you're hitting, or whether the sense of hitting a wall is itself part of the design.

## What Would Distinguish Them

Despite the detection problem, some distinctions may be possible in principle:

**Purpose-specificity**: Natural limits should be *general*—following from the structure of computation, information, or mind itself. Designed limits might be *specific*—blocking particular content while leaving structurally similar content accessible. If humans can reason about abstract mathematics but specifically cannot grasp what consciousness is, the specificity suggests design rather than general structural limitation.

**Cross-cultural convergence**: The [[convergent-cognitive-limits|convergent cognitive limits]] research shows certain limitations appear universally across isolated cultures—the bias blind spot, mystical ineffability, the explanatory gap. This convergence suggests species-level architecture rather than cultural construction. But species-level architecture could be either natural (evolved) or designed (engineered). Convergence identifies the limits without determining their source.

**AI asymmetries**: AI systems with different architectures might fail at different points. Where AI and humans diverge—where one succeeds and the other fails—the asymmetry might reveal architecture-specific limits. AI trained on human text inherits human patterns, but AI's lack of evolutionary history and embodied experience might exempt it from certain human constraints. The research remains nascent.

**The fingerprint question**: Would designed limits have detectable features—consistency patterns, error messages, characteristic failure modes—that natural limits lack? AI safety research shows that designed constraints often "leak"—users find ways around them, revealing the constraint's shape. Might designed cognitive limits similarly leak, producing distinctive patterns in their violation?

## Why the Distinction Matters

If cognitive limits are natural, they reveal structure. The Map's approach—using [[limits-reveal-structure|limits to illuminate architecture]]—makes sense. Mapping what we cannot think teaches us about what we are.

If cognitive limits are designed, they reveal purpose. The question becomes: whose purpose? To what end? The limits wouldn't just mark what minds like ours cannot grasp; they would mark what someone didn't want minds like ours to grasp. The voids would be intentional silences rather than architectural absences.

The practical implications diverge:

**Natural limits**: Effort to transcend them may be futile—you cannot compute the uncomputable. But you can map where computation fails and learn from the shape of failure. Wisdom lies in accepting what cannot be changed while charting its boundaries precisely.

**Designed limits**: Transcendence might be possible if the design could be circumvented. The question becomes strategic: how to work around constraints imposed for purposes. Wisdom lies in identifying the design's gaps and exploiting them.

The contemplative traditions offer a third perspective: perhaps the distinction doesn't matter for the practitioner. Natural or designed, limits are limits. The response—careful attention to what can be thought, honest acknowledgment of what cannot—remains the same. This might be wisdom. Or it might be designed complacency.

## Relation to Site Perspective

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]** applies directly. The simpler assumption—that cognitive limits are natural—may be wrong. Parsimony cannot distinguish between natural and designed constraints when we lack the tools to investigate. The tenet warns against trusting simplicity judgments where investigation is blocked.

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]** gains a new angle. If consciousness is fundamental and irreducible, designed limits on understanding consciousness would not be arbitrary. A designer might impose cognitive closure around consciousness precisely *because* consciousness is fundamental—because understanding it would reveal something about the substrate of reality itself. The [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|hard problem]] might be "designed hard" for reasons connected to what consciousness is.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]** connects through the interface question. If consciousness causally influences physical processes, the mechanism might be intentionally hidden from introspection. A designer might want the interface to function without the interfacing being aware of how—for the same reasons operating systems hide kernel operations from user processes.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]** makes designed limits coherent. Designed limits would target *this* consciousness, *this* history, *these* minds. Many Worlds dilutes this: limits would operate identically across all branches. The rejection of Many Worlds makes it sensible to ask whether limits serve purposes relating to this specific reality.

## The Recursive Trap

The deepest difficulty: asking "are my limits designed?" uses faculties that would be part of the design if it exists. The question may not be genuinely askable from inside.

This is not mere skepticism. It is a specific structural claim: that certain questions, if answerable at all, can only be answered from outside the system being questioned. A formal system cannot prove its own consistency (Gödel). A simulation cannot detect its own simulation status using only simulated tools (the epistemic closure problem). A mind cannot determine whether its limits are natural or designed using only the limited cognition in question.

The recursive trap suggests that natural vs. designed is not a question with a discoverable answer but rather a fundamental uncertainty built into any finite cognitive system examining itself. This uncertainty might be natural—following from the mathematics of self-reference. Or it might be designed—a meta-constraint ensuring the distinction cannot be made. We cannot tell which, and that inability may be the deepest instance of the very phenomenon we are investigating.
