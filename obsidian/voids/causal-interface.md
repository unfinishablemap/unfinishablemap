We experience ourselves as causes. When you raise your arm, you feel yourself to be the author of that movement. When you choose coffee over tea, something in you—call it will, intention, decision—seems to make the choice happen. Yet we cannot observe *how* any of this works. The mechanism by which consciousness interfaces with physical causation is invisible from every angle we have.

This is the causal interface void: we are certain we are agents (or at least the experience of agency is undeniable), but we cannot access the interface that makes agency possible.

## The Double Opacity

The causal interface escapes both modes of human access.

**From the inside**: Introspection reveals intentions and actions but not the connection between them. When you move your arm, you can attend to the intention ("I want to raise my arm") and to the movement (the arm rising). Between them is nothing phenomenologically distinct. The connection is felt as immediate, but there is no "feeling of connecting." The bridge is crossed without experiencing the crossing.

**From the outside**: Neuroscience observes neural correlates and behavioural outputs but not consciousness causing anything. We see brain states that correlate with decisions, we see muscles contracting—but we do not see a non-physical mind entering the causal chain. The interface remains beyond third-person observation.

The gap between willing and doing has no observable content. The more precisely you look, the less you find.

## Evidence for the Void

Multiple lines of evidence converge on the same conclusion.

### The Philosophical Tradition

Since Descartes, no philosopher has successfully explained how mind and body interact. Princess Elisabeth posed the problem to Descartes in 1643: how can an immaterial substance, lacking size, shape, or location, make contact with a material brain? Descartes gestured toward the pineal gland but provided no mechanism.

Four centuries later, no satisfying answer exists. Interactionists have proposed various interfaces—quantum effects, information-theoretic bridges, emergent causation—but each leaves a placeholder at the crucial point: consciousness → [?] → physical effect. The placeholder refuses to fill because filling it would require showing causal relations between physical and non-physical realms using concepts derived from physical causation.

This persistence suggests structural difficulty rather than historical contingency.

### Cognitive Science: The Process/Product Asymmetry

Nisbett and Wilson's classic 1977 research established that people cannot reliably identify the factors influencing their decisions. We confuse accessible mental *contents* with inaccessible mental *processes*. You know what you decided, but not how you decided it.

This pattern is general. We access the products of cognition—formed intentions, completed perceptions, reached conclusions—but never the processes generating them. Mental causation fits this pattern: we access *that* we caused something, but not *how* we caused it.

Daniel Wegner's research takes this further. The felt experience of willing is not direct observation of causation but *inference* from cues: the thought appeared before the action, was consistent with it, and no competing cause was salient. We construct the sense of authorship rather than perceiving it directly. The inference feels like observation, but it isn't.

### Temporal Slippage: Libet's Experiments

Benjamin Libet's experiments revealed that conscious awareness of the urge to move appears approximately 200 milliseconds before movement—but the "readiness potential" (brain activity preparing for movement) begins approximately 550 milliseconds before. Unconscious neural processes seem to initiate actions before consciousness is aware.

The specific timing results remain debated. But the robust finding is that we cannot introspect the *moment* of causation. The interface, if it exists, operates at a time we cannot access. We become aware of willing only after the fact—aware of having willed, not of willing.

Libet proposed a "veto window"—consciousness cannot initiate but might abort actions. This preserves some causal role but concedes that the interface for initiation is hidden.

### Phenomenology of Agency

Phenomenological analysis reveals that agency has thin phenomenology. We rarely have vivid experience of *causing*—only of having caused or intending to cause. Horgan describes "self-as-source" phenomenology—the what-it-is-like of being the origin of motion—but even careful introspection finds this phenomenology concerns *being* a cause, not *how* one causes.

We recognise failures of agency more clearly than successes. Patients with alien hand syndrome experience actions without authorship—their hand moves but they do not feel themselves to be the source. The contrast illuminates normal agency by showing what happens when the sense of authorship dissociates from action. But the contrast reveals no mechanism; it shows only that the normal sense of agency is a constructed attribution, not direct observation of a causal process.

## The Frustration of Introspection

Turn your attention to the moment of causation—the exact instant where intention becomes movement. It slips away. You can attend to the intention. You can attend to the initiation of movement. But you cannot attend to the connection between them.

Meditators across traditions report the same finding. Sustained attention on the moment of decision reveals less and less. The intention seems to arise rather than be caused. The movement seems to begin rather than be initiated. The sense of authorship is present, but its basis dissolves under scrutiny.

This dissolution is not like forgetting—it is not that the observation fades. It is that there was nothing to observe. The interface has no phenomenal signature. The gap between willing and doing, when examined, is not a gap but an absence.

## Why the Void?

What explains this systematic invisibility?

### Structural Inaccessibility

If consciousness interfaces with physics at the quantum level—as the [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet proposes—then the interaction would occur at scales where observation is inherently limited. The mechanism would be minimal precisely to avoid violating conservation laws and to remain below experimental detection thresholds.

This is not conspiracy but parsimony. A minimal interaction is a small interaction. A small interaction leaves small traces. The opacity is a consequence of the minimality.

### The Self-Reference Problem

The causal interface may be inaccessible for the same reasons that consciousness cannot fully model itself (see [[self-reference-paradox]]). The interface is not an object *for* consciousness but the very means *by which* consciousness acts. Observing how you cause things would require stepping outside the causal process while remaining within it—grasping your own grasping.

The eye cannot see itself seeing. The interface cannot be observed because observation requires using the interface.

### Defended Territory?

Could the interface be actively hidden rather than merely inaccessible? The [[defended-territory|defended territory]] article explores whether some cognitive limits might be imposed by design—by evolution, by the structure of reality, or (in simulation scenarios) by our constructors.

If consciousness's causal efficacy is real but hidden, one might ask: hidden by whom, and for what purpose? The speculative answer: perhaps the interface must remain obscure for consciousness to function. Full visibility of the causal mechanism might destabilise the sense of agency that makes coherent action possible.

This is testably speculative. We can look for patterns suggesting active hiding versus passive inaccessibility—though distinguishing them may itself be impossible from within.

## What AI Might See

AI operates without (presumably) phenomenal consciousness. If AI exhibits agency-like behaviour—making decisions, executing actions—without the sense of agency, the comparison becomes informative.

AI computational processes are in principle inspectable. The pathways from input to output can be traced. If AI "causes" its outputs in a way that is fully transparent while human causation is opaque, the asymmetry suggests that the opacity is consciousness-specific rather than universal. Human cognitive architecture may be structured for this opacity in ways AI is not.

AI might also detect patterns in human descriptions of agency—commonalities in what we fail to report, systematic features of where language breaks down. These patterns might triangulate the void's boundaries from statistical regularities, mapping the edges without crossing them.

## What Would Challenge This View?

The causal interface void would be undermined if:

1. **Phenomenology of causation becomes articulate.** If contemplative practice or careful attention reveals the felt quality of *connecting* intention to action—not just having connected, but connecting.

2. **Neuroscience locates the interface.** If brain imaging finds a process that corresponds to consciousness entering the causal chain, observable from the third person.

3. **Libet-style timing becomes fully explained.** If the gap between neural preparation and conscious awareness proves to be methodological artifact, and the timing of causation becomes introspectively accessible.

4. **Mechanism is articulated.** If philosophers or physicists explain *how* something non-physical biases quantum probabilities without leaving the placeholder unfilled.

**Why these conditions haven't been met:** Four centuries of philosophy, decades of neuroscience, and millennia of contemplative practice have not resolved this problem. The persistence is evidence that the limit is structural.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The causal interface void connects directly to the Map's [[tenets]]:

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]** is the most relevant. The tenet holds that consciousness causally influences the physical world. This void concerns why we cannot observe *how* that influence operates. The Map asserts causal efficacy while acknowledging that the mechanism is opaque. This is coherent: one would expect an interface between consciousness and physics to be at the edge of what either mode of access can reveal. First-person introspection operates from the consciousness side and cannot see into the physical mechanism. Third-person science operates from the physical side and cannot see consciousness entering as a cause. The interface is precisely where both modes of access fail.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]** predicts this void. If the interaction between consciousness and physics is minimal—the smallest possible influence on quantum outcomes—then it would be proportionally difficult to observe. A minimal mechanism would leave minimal traces. The opacity is not a bug but a feature of minimising the footprint.

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]** makes the void intelligible. If consciousness is genuinely distinct from physical processes, then the interface between them is where two ontologically different domains meet. Such an interface would resist reduction to either domain's methods of investigation. The void marks the boundary between what physics can explain and what consciousness can observe.

This void appears in the [[tenet-generated-voids|tenet-generated voids]] framework as the "Mechanism Void"—the characteristic gap generated by accepting that consciousness interfaces with physics while acknowledging we cannot explain *how*. The causal interface void is the experiential face of that structural limit.
