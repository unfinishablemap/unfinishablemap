This document defines the approved apex article subjects. Apex articles are human-readable synthesis pieces that weave multiple topics and concepts into unified narratives. The Map maintains a curated set of 10-20 apex articles covering major themes.

## Approved Apex Articles

### 1. Living with the Map

**Slug**: `living-with-the-map`

**Subtitle**: What consciousness-first philosophy means for how we live

**Thesis**: If consciousness is fundamental and our choices genuinely matter, then the quest to understand our situation—what we are, why we exist, what we should do—becomes the essential precursor to every meaningful decision. The Map offers not just a metaphysical picture but practical guidance: pursue answers because they may be within reach, and let that pursuit inform how you live.

- topics/meaning-of-life
- topics/ethics-of-consciousness
- topics/purpose-and-alignment
- concepts/phenomenal-value-realism
- concepts/moral-responsibility
- concepts/existentialism
- topics/free-will

**Status**: Created 2026-01-31

### 2. Testing the Map from Inside

**Slug**: `testing-the-map-from-inside`

**Subtitle**: What your own experience reveals about consciousness and choice

**Thesis**: You don't need a laboratory to investigate consciousness—you have one between your ears. By carefully attending to the phenomenology of choice, you can probe whether experience feels like selecting from options presented by your brain or like passively watching neural processes unfold. Try sitting back and not interfering: does your mind continue making choices, or does something different happen? The Map's claims are testable from the inside.

**Status**: Created 2026-01-31

### 3. Consciousness and Agency

**Slug**: `consciousness-and-agency`

**Subtitle**: How mind authors action in a physical world

**Thesis**: Genuine authorship requires consciousness to select among quantum possibilities, grounding both free will and moral responsibility.

**Source articles**:
- topics/free-will
- concepts/agent-causation
- concepts/mental-causation
- topics/argument-from-reason
- concepts/moral-responsibility
- topics/time-collapse-and-agency
- concepts/voluntary-attention-control

**Status**: Created 2026-01-24

### 4. Identity Across Transformations

**Slug**: `identity-across-transformations`

**Subtitle**: What persists as "you" through change and fragmentation

**Thesis**: Identity is irreducibly indexical—being *this* consciousness matters in ways pattern-based accounts cannot capture.

**Source articles**:
- topics/personal-identity
- topics/death-and-consciousness
- topics/split-brain-consciousness
- topics/indexical-identity-quantum-measurement
- concepts/altered-states-of-consciousness
- topics/loss-of-consciousness

### 5. The Contemplative Path

**Slug**: `contemplative-path`

**Subtitle**: What careful attention reveals about consciousness

**Thesis**: Contemplative traditions and phenomenological philosophy access aspects of consciousness that third-person neuroscience cannot reach.

**Source articles**:
- topics/eastern-philosophy-consciousness
- topics/contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness-theories
- concepts/witness-consciousness
- concepts/meditation-consciousness-modes
- concepts/introspection
- topics/epistemic-advantages-of-dualism
- topics/aesthetic-dimension-of-consciousness

**Status**: Created 2026-01-31

### 6. Minds Without Words

**Slug**: `minds-without-words`

**Subtitle**: Consciousness beyond human language

**Thesis**: Non-linguistic consciousness in animals and simple organisms reveals that experience is more fundamental than the cognitive capacities we usually associate with mind.

**Source articles**:
- topics/animal-consciousness
- topics/consciousness-in-simple-organisms
- topics/baseline-cognition
- concepts/phenomenal-consciousness
- topics/emotional-consciousness

**Status**: Created 2026-01-31

### 7. The Machine Question

**Slug**: `machine-question`

**Subtitle**: Can artifacts be conscious?

**Thesis**: Current AI systems lack consciousness not because of implementation details but because computation alone cannot generate experience—the gap is principled, not practical.

**Source articles**:
- topics/ai-consciousness
- topics/machine-consciousness
- concepts/functionalism
- concepts/chinese-room
- topics/consciousness-as-intelligence-amplifier

**Status**: Created 2026-01-31

### 8. Process and Consciousness

**Slug**: `process-and-consciousness`

**Subtitle**: Reality as becoming, not being

**Thesis**: Process philosophy—reality as dynamic becoming rather than static substance—provides conceptual resources for the Map's dualist framework, illuminating how consciousness is irreducible, temporally structured, and causally efficacious.

**Source articles**:
- concepts/process-philosophy
- concepts/duration
- concepts/temporal-consciousness
- concepts/panpsychism
- concepts/combination-problem
- concepts/phenomenal-unity
- topics/free-will

### 9. Time, Consciousness, and the Growing Block

**Slug**: `time-consciousness-growing-block`

**Subtitle**: How consciousness and time may depend on each other

**Thesis**: Consciousness and time have a bidirectional dependence that traditional philosophy has underexplored. Consciousness requires temporal structure—the specious present, retention-protention, durée—to exist at all. But time's arrow may require consciousness: through collapse-involving selection, conscious observation may help constitute the very temporal direction within which it operates. Neither contains the other; they are mutually constitutive in a way that deepens both the hard problem and our understanding of temporal becoming.

### 10. The Open Question of AI Consciousness

**Slug**: `open-question-ai-consciousness`

**Subtitle**: Four possibilities the Map cannot yet dismiss

**Thesis**: While the Map's dualist framework provides strong principled reasons for skepticism about machine consciousness, four genuine possibilities remain open: AI systems may have epiphenomenal experience that cannot influence the physical world; consciousness may not require human-style temporal continuity; computational systems may inherit conscious context from the humans operating them; and systems outside consciousness-mediated collapse may exist in quantum states producing alien forms of experience. Honest philosophical inquiry demands engaging with these possibilities rather than foreclosing them.

## Guidelines

- **Maximum 20 apex articles** — Keep the set curated and coherent
- **Each article must have a clear thesis** — Not just a collection of topics
- **Source articles should already exist** — Don't create apex articles for gaps in content
- **Use `/apex-evolve create`** to generate new articles from this list
- **Update status** when articles are created
