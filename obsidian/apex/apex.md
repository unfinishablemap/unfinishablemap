Apex articles are human-readable synthesis pieces that integrate multiple topics, concepts, and arguments into coherent narratives. They serve as entry points for readers who want an integrated view rather than atomic deep dives.

Unlike topics (which focus on single subjects) or concepts (which define building blocks), apex articles weave threads together to present the Map's worldview on major themes.
