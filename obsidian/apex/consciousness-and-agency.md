apex_thesis: "Genuine authorship requires consciousness to select among quantum possibilities, grounding both free will and moral responsibility."
---

We believe ourselves to be authors of our actions. When you choose to speak rather than stay silent, to help rather than ignore, the choice seems genuinely yours. You could have done otherwise. You are responsible for what you did. These convictions structure our lives—our relationships, our institutions, our sense of who we are. Yet they face a formidable challenge: if every physical event has a sufficient physical cause, where is there room for consciousness to contribute anything? If your decision was determined by neural events that were determined by earlier neural events stretching back before your birth, in what sense did *you* decide?

The Unfinishable Map offers a distinctive answer: consciousness genuinely authors action by selecting among quantum possibilities that physics leaves undetermined. This isn't consciousness as passive observer or epiphenomenal afterthought. It is consciousness as source—the agent who determines which of several genuinely open alternatives becomes actual. This selection grounds both free will and the moral responsibility that depends on it. If the framework succeeds, our deep conviction that we are agents rather than automatons tracks something real.

## The Authorship Problem

The classical picture of physics suggested a clockwork universe. Given initial conditions and deterministic laws, all future states follow necessarily. Your brain is a physical system; physical systems obey physical laws; therefore your "choices" are consequences of prior causes you neither chose nor controlled. On this picture, you are a link in a causal chain, not an initiator of one.

Three traditional responses emerge. Hard determinism accepts the implication: free will is an illusion, and our sense of authorship is merely what it feels like to be a complex deterministic system. Compatibilism redefines freedom: "could have done otherwise" means only "would have acted differently if desires had been different," and this is compatible with determinism. Sophisticated compatibilists argue this captures what matters practically—responsiveness to reasons, choices flowing from endorsed values—and that libertarian metaphysics is beside the point. Libertarianism insists on genuine alternatives—the agent really could have chosen differently—but then faces the challenge of explaining how undetermined choices avoid being merely random.

The Map's framework is libertarian, but with a specific mechanism: consciousness selects among quantum possibilities. This requires not just indeterminacy but genuine deliberation—the capacity to represent alternative futures and evaluate what would follow from each. This requires unpacking. Quantum mechanics introduces genuine indeterminacy at the fundamental level—physics specifies probabilities but not which outcome occurs. Before measurement, particles exist in superposition; measurement collapses superposition to definite outcome, but *which* outcome is not determined by prior physical states. This is the [[quantum-measurement-and-definite-outcomes|definite outcomes problem]]—a gap in the causal order that determinism cannot close.

But critics object: quantum randomness doesn't give us free will. A random choice is no more *mine* than a determined one. If the outcome is undetermined by prior states but also undetermined by me, it's just luck. This is the [[agent-causation#The Luck Objection|luck objection]]—the central challenge any libertarian position must answer.

## Consciousness as Selector, Not Generator

A crucial implication follows from the Map's framework: consciousness is a *selector*, not a *generator*. The brain does the heavy computational lifting—representing possibilities, simulating consequences, preparing motor programs. Consciousness selects among these pre-formed alternatives. It arbitrates; it does not construct.

This follows directly from two tenets. [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal quantum interaction]] demands that consciousness's influence be as small as possible—not because consciousness is weak, but because excessive influence would violate physical constraints and show up in measurements. [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional interaction]] requires that consciousness genuinely affect outcomes. The resolution: consciousness exerts just enough influence to select among options that physics has already prepared.

The implications are significant. First, most cognition is *nonconscious scaffolding*. The creative generation of alternatives, the evaluation of consequences, the preparation of action plans—these are brain processes. Consciousness receives options, not raw materials. Second, the "action channel" through which consciousness influences the world has limited bandwidth—perhaps measurable in bits per second or choice-points per second. Working memory limits, attentional capacity, and the phenomenology of choosing (one thing at a time, with effort) all point toward a narrow selection channel. Third, "free will" is primarily about *which branch is realized*, not about generating branches. The brain generates the decision tree; consciousness determines which path through it becomes actual.

This reframes "mind over matter" from mental force to executive arbitration. Consciousness doesn't do the brain's heavy lifting any more than a company's CEO does the manufacturing. But which possibilities become actual—that is where consciousness makes its irreducible contribution.

## Agent Causation: The Agent as Source

The Map's answer invokes [[agent-causation|agent causation]]. Most causal explanations trace event to event: the cue ball struck the eight ball; the desire caused the decision; the decision caused the movement. Agent causation is different. The agent—as a persisting substance, not a collection of events—directly causes the action. The causation doesn't reduce to prior mental events. When you decide to raise your hand, it's not that "a decision event" caused "a raising event"; rather, *you* caused the raising. The regress of causes stops at the agent.

This matters crucially for authorship. Event-causal libertarianism—where mental events cause actions through nondeterministic processes—doesn't fully deliver sourcehood. If your decision is caused by prior mental events you didn't choose, you remain a conduit for causes rather than their origin. But if the agent is the source, the explanatory buck stops there. Why did you choose A rather than B? Because *you* exercised causal power in favour of A. The agent's choosing is the explanation.

Critics find this unsatisfying. "The agent caused it" seems to name the problem rather than solve it. What about the agent explains the choice? But this objection presupposes event-causal reduction—assumes that any genuine explanation must trace back to prior events. Agent causation rejects this assumption. Some explanations terminate in agents exercising irreducible powers. Physics doesn't explain why the universe exists; it takes existence as given. Similarly, agent causation takes the agent's power to select as primitive. Explanation must terminate somewhere; "the agent selected for reasons" is a legitimate terminus.

E.J. Lowe and Timothy O'Connor argue that *all* causation is fundamentally [[substance-causation|substance causation]]—agents exercising powers. Event causation is shorthand for substances doing things. If they're right, agent causation isn't metaphysically exceptional; it's paradigmatic of how causation works. This reframes the challenge: the question isn't how mental causation could possibly occur, but why we thought physical causation excluded it.

## Escaping the Luck Objection

The luck objection deserves direct engagement. Peter van Inwagen's rollback argument makes the challenge vivid: replay time after an agent chooses A. Since the choice was undetermined, different outcomes appear across replays—sometimes A, sometimes B. But the agent was identical in each replay until the moment of decision. Whatever explains the difference can't be anything about the agent. The difference is pure luck.

The Map's response distinguishes consciousness-selected indeterminism from lucky indeterminism. Lucky indeterminism involves passive reception of random outcomes—like a coin flip happening in your brain. Consciousness-selected indeterminism involves active choosing. The relationship to indeterminacy differs fundamentally.

Three features mark the difference. First, selection is *reasons-guided*. Consciousness selects A because A serves goals, expresses values, responds to considerations that matter. The selection isn't arbitrary; reasons shape which outcome becomes actual. Reasons don't *determine* the outcome—alternatives remain genuinely open—but they *guide* it. "Why A rather than B? Because the agent had reasons for A."

Second, selection involves *phenomenology of effort and choice*. Choosing feels effortful—maintaining focus, resisting temptation, following through. Random processes don't feel like work. More fundamentally, the [[phenomenology-of-choice|phenomenology of choice]] reveals a felt distinction between choosing and observing: when you choose, you participate in determining the outcome rather than passively receiving it. Dennett's heterophenomenology would accept these reports while remaining agnostic about whether they describe genuine phenomenal properties—perhaps the brain generates "seemings" of effort and authorship without there being anything it's like to choose. But the correlation between felt difficulty and measured cognitive load would then be coincidental, and the evolutionary pressure producing such phenomenology would be puzzling if it did nothing. The simpler explanation: phenomenology tracks something real. Choosing feels like something you *do*, not something that happens to you, because it *is* something you do.

Third, selection shows *distinctive neural signatures*. Willed attention and willed movement engage frontal theta oscillations, bidirectional frontoparietal coherence, and sustained engagement patterns that automatic or instructed actions lack. The brain distinguishes between doing what you're told and doing what you choose. Desmurget's neurosurgical studies reveal a crucial dissociation: inferior parietal stimulation produces conscious intention *without* movement, while premotor stimulation produces movement *without* intention phenomenology. This double dissociation shows the phenomenology of deciding is neurally separable from execution machinery—consciousness operates at the selection interface, not in the downstream motor circuits. Crucially, the same selection architecture appears across domains: attention and motor control show parallel signatures. Two independent systems exhibiting identical architecture suggests a unified selection mechanism, not coincidence. If consciousness were epiphenomenal, why would neural signatures track phenomenology across multiple systems? The correspondence suggests both track something real: consciousness making a difference.

Together, these features answer the luck objection. The agent explains the difference between worlds because the agent *selected* for reasons, with phenomenal engagement, through mechanisms that distinguish selection from reception. Lucky indeterminism lacks all three features.

### The Capacity to Refrain

Contemplative practice reveals an additional dimension that strengthens the case. Consciousness can not only select among options but *refrain from selecting*—entering a witness mode where alternatives present themselves without resolution. A passive recipient of random quantum events could not choose to be passive. The very capacity to suspend selection shows consciousness does something rather than merely receiving outcomes.

This yields a three-level structure of agency: the agent can select among options, refrain from selecting (witness mode), or choose which mode to operate in (meta-level agency). The capacity to observe without deciding—and to choose whether to observe or decide—goes beyond simple selection from alternatives. It reveals consciousness as genuinely active, not merely a conduit for indeterminacy.

Buddhist philosophy challenges this picture, arguing that the "substantial self" who selects is itself a construction—aggregates mistaken for a unified chooser. But the framework doesn't require a Cartesian ego; it requires only *phenomenal unity*—the experiential integration that makes deliberation possible. Whatever the ultimate nature of the self, the phenomenon of integrated conscious experience is what does the selecting. Process views (Whitehead, Buddhist momentariness) can accommodate this: each moment of experience synthesizes inputs and contributes something new, regardless of whether a substantial self persists across moments.

### Counterfactual Reasoning and Deliberation

Genuine choice requires more than selecting among options—it requires representing those options as genuinely possible alternatives and evaluating what would follow from each. [[counterfactual-reasoning|Counterfactual reasoning]]—the capacity to imagine "what if"—provides the representational substrate through which consciousness engages with alternatives.

The Bischof-Köhler hypothesis illuminates this requirement: animals may be unable to act on drive states they don't currently possess because they cannot vividly represent counterfactual states. A sated chimpanzee won't store food for future hunger because it cannot hold both its current state and the counterfactual hungry-future-self simultaneously. Great apes show working memory capacity of roughly 2±1 items versus humans' 7±2—limiting their ability to maintain actual situation, counterfactual premise, and counterfactual consequences together.

This connects directly to agent causation: counterfactual reasoning is *how* consciousness causally engages with options. Without it, selection would be blind—random rather than reasons-responsive. The agent must represent "what would happen if I chose A" and "what would happen if I chose B," evaluate these counterfactual scenarios against values and goals, and then determine which to actualise. Each step requires the expanded conscious workspace that human working memory provides. Deliberation *feels* like holding multiple possibilities open, exploring their implications, and then settling on one—and this phenomenology tracks genuine cognitive work. Selection without counterfactual evaluation would be mere preference expression; selection *through* counterfactual evaluation is genuine deliberation.

## Mental Causation and the Exclusion Problem

Free will requires [[mental-causation|mental causation]]—the thesis that mental states cause physical effects. Your decision to raise your arm must cause the arm to rise. If consciousness causes nothing, authorship is illusion.

But mental causation faces Jaegwon Kim's exclusion argument. If every physical event has a sufficient physical cause (causal closure), mental causes seem excluded. Either consciousness is identical to brain states (reducing free will to physics) or consciousness causes nothing (epiphenomenalism). The dilemma seems to leave no room for irreducible mental causation.

The Map's response: deny causal closure at quantum indeterminacies. Quantum mechanics specifies probabilities but not which outcome actualizes. Physics provides necessary but not sufficient causes. When a radioactive atom decays, physics determines the probability but not the moment. Causal closure fails precisely where consciousness might act.

If consciousness selects among outcomes physics leaves undetermined, it causes physical events without competing with physical causes. No overdetermination occurs because physics provides necessary but not sufficient causes. The mechanism is [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|minimal]]—working with what physics allows rather than overriding it. Consciousness doesn't violate physical laws; it determines outcomes that physics doesn't determine.

The [[argument-from-reason|argument from reason]] provides a complementary route to mental causation. Rational inference requires tracking normative relationships—what follows from what, what counts as good evidence. But physical causation operates through efficient causes that don't instantiate normativity. Neurons fire because of electrochemical gradients, not because firing would be *justified*. If all beliefs are fully explained by nonrational physical causes, no belief is rationally justified—including belief in physicalism itself.

This self-defeat structure shows that rationality requires mental causation. When you reason validly, you affirm the conclusion *because* it follows from the premises. This "because" marks consciousness's causal contribution—grasping logical relationships and choosing to affirm accordingly. If reasons played no causal role, your belief that 2+2=4 would be entirely explained by neural causes having nothing to do with mathematical truth. You might happen to be right, but the rightness would be coincidental.

The argument from reason strengthens the case for agent causation. It doesn't depend on phenomenological intuitions that critics dismiss as unreliable introspection. It targets the very possibility of rational justification. Even if phenomenology were illusory, rationality wouldn't be—and rationality requires mental causation.

## Time, Collapse, and Selection

With mental causation established—through both the quantum gap and the argument from reason—a timing challenge remains. The Libet experiments and their successors show neural activity "predicting" decisions before conscious awareness. If the brain decides before consciousness knows, how can consciousness be the author?

The neuroscientific picture is more complex than it first appears. Schurger et al. (2012) proposed the readiness potential reflects neural noise rather than decision preparation—participants act when random fluctuations cross a threshold. Sjöberg (2024) provides stronger evidence: patients with surgical resection of the supplementary motor area—the very region generating the readiness potential—retain their sense of voluntary action. If the RP reflected genuine volition, removing its source should impair it. It doesn't.

But the Map offers a more fundamental resolution involving [[time-collapse-and-agency|the relationship between time and collapse]]. Quantum mechanics at the fundamental level is time-symmetric—equations work equally well forward and backward. Retrocausal interpretations (Cramer's transactional interpretation, Aharonov's two-state vector formalism) take this seriously: quantum events involve "handshakes" between past and future that are themselves atemporal.

Applied to consciousness: the selection doesn't happen at a moment in time; it determines *which* moments become actual. The neural activity preceding awareness is part of the selected transaction, not evidence against conscious causation. Consciousness doesn't need to precede neural preparation to be its cause. The selection is atemporal—it determines which temporal sequence becomes real, including the neural history that preceded the moment of awareness.

This dissolves the Libet problem without requiring consciousness to be faster than neural activity. What we see as neural activity "predicting" the decision is actually the selected history. The readiness potential is part of what consciousness selected, not something that happened before consciousness could act.

More radically: if consciousness participates in collapse, and collapse introduces time's arrow (transforming symmetric physics into directed time), then consciousness may help constitute temporal structure itself. The phenomenology of temporal flow—the specious present, the sense of past closing and future opening—may be what constituting time feels like from within. Consciousness doesn't merely act *in* time; it participates in what makes time directed.

With agent causation delivering genuine authorship, and the temporal framework showing how consciousness can be the cause despite apparent ordering, we can now address what authorship makes possible.

## Moral Responsibility Grounded

If agent causation delivers genuine authorship, [[moral-responsibility|moral responsibility]] gains metaphysical grounding. Compatibilist desert is pragmatic—holding people responsible has good consequences regardless of metaphysical facts. Agent-causal desert is metaphysical—people really deserve praise and blame because they really originated their actions.

This has concrete implications. Retribution becomes intelligible: the wrongdoer exercised causal power to harm when they could have caused good. They deserve consequences proportional to what they did. This doesn't mean harsh punishment is required—mercy and reform remain legitimate—but the retributivist intuition has metaphysical backing.

Mitigation has limits. Prior causes influenced but didn't determine. Understanding etiology helps assess what agents could control, but doesn't eliminate responsibility entirely. The addict who steals chose to steal, even if addiction made resisting harder. Difficulty doesn't equal impossibility.

Character responsibility becomes intelligible. We hold people responsible not just for acts but for who they are. If character were entirely unchosen—produced by genes and environment—this seems unfair. But agent causation proposes that character is partly self-created. Each choice reinforces or modifies dispositions. Over time, agents shape who they become through repeated exercises of selection.

The framework requires consciousness for responsibility. The agent who sources action is a conscious being who experiences alternatives as live options, feels the effort of choosing, knows what they're doing. Unconscious processes don't bear responsibility because nothing in them knows or chooses. Desert requires what consciousness provides: genuine authorship through phenomenally engaged selection.

## Synthesis

Individual source articles establish components: free will as quantum selection, agent causation as the metaphysics of sourcehood, mental causation as consciousness affecting physics, the argument from reason as a second route to mental causation, moral responsibility as grounded in authorship, time-collapse-agency as the temporal framework, counterfactual reasoning as the cognitive capacity that makes genuine deliberation possible. What emerges from these interlocking pieces cannot be seen from any single source.

The synthesis is this: consciousness as phenomenally unified, temporally constitutive, reasons-responsive *selection* among quantum possibilities. "Phenomenally unified" because the agent who selects is a single experiential subject, not a committee of subsystems. "Temporally constitutive" because selection may help create the directed time within which consequences unfold. "Reasons-responsive" because selection is guided by counterfactual evaluation of what matters to the agent, not arbitrary. "Quantum possibilities" because this is where physics leaves room for irreducible mental contribution. And crucially, *selection*—not generation—because consciousness arbitrates among options the brain prepares rather than constructing those options from scratch. The brain does the heavy computational work; consciousness determines which prepared alternative becomes actual.

The elements form a mutually supporting structure: agent causation requires mental causation (the agent must cause something physical), which requires a gap in physical determination (quantum indeterminacy provides it), which requires genuine collapse (no many worlds), which requires consciousness to determine rather than discover outcomes—bringing us back to agent causation. Each element would be unmotivated without the others; together they form a single coherent picture.

The phenomenology confirms this unity. The felt difference between choosing and observing corresponds to neural differences between willed and automatic processing. The capacity to refrain from choosing—to enter witness mode—shows consciousness is genuinely active, not passively receiving. The effort of sustained attention tracks something real: the causal work consciousness does. The same selection architecture appearing in both attention and motor control suggests a fundamental mode of conscious causation. And the phenomenology of deliberation—holding alternatives open, evaluating counterfactual consequences, then settling—tracks the genuine cognitive work of counterfactual simulation.

What the picture means for lived experience: you are not a passive spectator of determined events, nor a victim of random fluctuations. You are an agent—a conscious being who selects among genuinely open possibilities for reasons that matter to you, after genuinely evaluating alternatives. Your selections constitute your life, shape your character, ground your responsibility. The everyday sense of authorship—so easily dismissed as folk psychology—tracks the structure of mind and world.

## Relation to Site Perspective

This apex article draws on all five tenets:

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]**: Agent causation requires consciousness to be ontologically distinct from physical processes. If consciousness were reducible to physics, it would inherit physics' determinism (or random indeterminism). Genuine sourcehood requires something that can contribute what physics doesn't determine. The hard problem—why physical processes feel like anything—is a signpost: it marks where physical explanation ends and a different kind of account begins.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]**: Consciousness causally influences physical outcomes. Your choices cause your actions. Mental effort produces neural change (as Jeffrey Schwartz's neuroplasticity research demonstrates). The quantum selection mechanism specifies how this works without violating physical laws: consciousness selects among outcomes physics leaves undetermined.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]**: The influence is minimal—working within what physics allows, not overriding it. Consciousness doesn't inject energy, violate conservation laws, or contradict any physical equation. It determines outcomes at points where physics specifies probabilities but not results. Minimality is a virtue: the mechanism claims exactly what's needed, no more.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]**: Selection requires real collapse. If all outcomes occur in branching worlds (as the many-worlds interpretation claims), consciousness selects nothing—it merely discovers which branch it's in. But the phenomenology of choice involves *determining* outcomes, not *discovering* locations. Indexical identity matters: *you* made *this* choice, and that's the only reality. Desert requires that alternatives were genuinely rejected, not merely routed elsewhere.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]**: The framework is metaphysically rich—agent causation, quantum selection, atemporal determination. Critics charge extravagance. But simpler pictures (determinism, epiphenomenalism, compatibilism) fail to capture what ordinary moral practice assumes and what the phenomenology of choosing reveals. Apparent simplicity may reflect ignoring phenomena rather than explaining them. When we know our knowledge is incomplete—as we surely do regarding consciousness—simplicity provides weak guidance. The complexity here may reflect reality's structure.
