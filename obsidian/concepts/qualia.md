Qualia are the subjective, experiential qualities of conscious states—the redness of red, the painfulness of pain, the taste of coffee. They are what it is *like* to have an experience.

The term comes from the Latin *qualis*, meaning "of what kind." In philosophy of mind, qualia (singular: quale) refer to the intrinsic, ineffable, private properties of our conscious experiences. When you see a red apple, there is something it is like to experience that redness—a felt quality that accompanies your perception. This quality is the quale of redness.

## Why Qualia Matter

Qualia sit at the heart of the [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|hard problem of consciousness]]. We can explain the neurological processes that detect light wavelengths, but no amount of neurological detail tells us *why* there is something it is like to see red rather than nothing at all. The explanatory gap between physical description and subjective experience remains unbridged.

Consider two scenarios:
1. A neuroscientist gives a complete account of pain—nerve fibers, neurotransmitter release, brain regions activated
2. You stub your toe

The first describes pain from the outside. The second involves the quale of pain—the felt quality that makes pain *painful*. These seem fundamentally different kinds of knowledge.

## Key Properties of Qualia

Philosophers have characterised qualia in various ways:

### Intrinsic

Qualia are not relational—they are properties of experience itself, not of how experience relates to the world. The redness of red is intrinsic to the experience, not defined by what red things have in common.

### Private

You cannot directly access my qualia, nor I yours. We can compare behaviour, point to the same objects, use the same words—but your experience of red may differ from mine in ways neither of us could ever detect. This privacy makes qualia fundamentally different from publicly observable properties.

### Ineffable

Qualia resist complete verbal description. How would you explain the taste of coffee to someone who has never tasted it? You might describe it as "bitter" or "rich," but these words don't convey the actual quale. The experience itself exceeds any description.

### Directly Apprehensible

Despite being ineffable to others, qualia are immediately known to the one experiencing them. You don't infer that you're in pain—you directly apprehend the painful quality. This direct acquaintance gives qualia a peculiar epistemic status.

## Thought Experiments

Several famous thought experiments illuminate what qualia are and why they pose problems for physicalism:

### Mary's Room

Frank Jackson's knowledge argument: Mary is a brilliant scientist who knows every physical fact about colour vision, but has lived her entire life in a black-and-white room. When she finally sees colour for the first time, does she learn something new?

If yes—if there is something Mary learns that she couldn't deduce from all the physical facts—then physical facts don't exhaust reality. The quale of redness is something over and above the physical.

### Inverted Qualia

Imagine someone whose colour qualia are inverted relative to yours. When you both look at a red apple, you experience red and they experience green (and vice versa). But since they learned colour words pointing at the same objects you did, neither of you would ever know. Their behaviour would be identical to yours.

If this scenario is coherent, then qualia are not fully determined by functional or behavioural facts. Two beings could be functionally identical yet experientially different.

### Zombies

A [[philosophical-zombies|philosophical zombie]] is a being physically identical to you but with no qualia—no inner experience at all. The zombie moves, speaks, even says "I experience redness!" but there is nothing it is like to be the zombie. If zombies are conceivable (even if not possible), this suggests that qualia are not entailed by physical facts.

The zombie argument proceeds from conceivability to possibility to the falsity of physicalism: if we can coherently imagine a physical duplicate without experience, and if conceivability is evidence of possibility, then consciousness is something "extra" not necessitated by physics alone. The qualia the zombie lacks—the redness, the painfulness, the taste—are precisely what physical description leaves out.

## The Challenge to Materialism

Qualia present a fundamental challenge to materialist views of consciousness. If qualia are intrinsic, private, and ineffable, they resist the standard moves that physicalism makes for other phenomena.

The [[materialism|materialist]] faces a dilemma:
- **Deny qualia exist**: Eliminativism claims there are no qualia—our introspective reports are systematically mistaken. But this seems to deny the obvious: the redness is right there, being experienced.
- **Reduce qualia to physical properties**: But how? Identifying a quale with a brain state leaves unexplained why that state has any experiential character at all.
- **Accept qualia as emerging from complexity**: But mere complexity doesn't explain why there's something it's like. A billion neurons interacting is still just neurons interacting—where does the felt quality come from?

### The Illusionist Challenge

[[illusionism|Illusionism]] represents the most radical physicalist strategy against qualia. Keith Frankish and Daniel Dennett argue that qualia—the intrinsic, private, ineffable properties described above—do not actually exist. We *seem* to have experiences with these properties, but this seeming is itself a misrepresentation. There are no phenomenal properties, only representations *as if* there were.

This trades the hard problem for an "illusion problem": explaining why the illusion of qualia is so compelling. But critics note that all illusions presuppose experience. To be under an illusion, something must be experiencing the illusion. Raymond Tallis argues this makes illusionism incoherent—invoking experience to deny experience.

Galen Strawson called illusionism "the silliest claim ever made" in philosophy. The existence of experience seems undeniable even if its *contents* might be illusory. A phenomenal experience need not be *veridical* to exist. The belief that I'm seeing a pink elephant may be mistaken, but not that I'm having *some* experience.

The persistence of this debate—and the extremity of illusionism's denial—itself testifies to qualia's resistance to physicalist explanation. If qualia could be smoothly reduced to neural states, physicalists wouldn't need to deny their existence entirely.

## The Functionalist Challenge

[[functionalism|Functionalism]] offers a sophisticated response to concerns about qualia. On this view, mental states are defined by their causal roles—what causes them and what they cause. Pain is whatever state is caused by tissue damage, causes avoidance behaviour, and interacts appropriately with beliefs and desires. Qualia, on this account, are not intrinsic properties of experience but the functional roles that experiences play.

This explains multiple realizability: pain in humans and pain in octopuses can both be pain because both states play the pain-role, regardless of different physical implementations. And it makes consciousness scientifically tractable—we can study functional organization without solving metaphysics.

But functionalism struggles with the thought experiments above. If inverted qualia are possible—if two beings could be functionally identical yet have different qualitative experiences—then qualia are not captured by functional role. The functionalist must either deny that inverted qualia scenarios are genuinely conceivable or accept that functional descriptions leave something out.

The absent qualia objection sharpens the point. Philosopher Ned Block imagined the population of China organized to replicate a human brain's functional organization, with each person playing the role of a neuron and communicating by two-way radio. The system would be functionally identical to a conscious brain. But would there be something it's like to be China? Would qualitative experience emerge from people passing messages? The intuition that it would not—that the system would be a "blockhead" with no inner life—suggests that consciousness requires more than functional organization.

Block called this the "absent qualia" problem: a system could implement the right functions yet lack qualia entirely. If so, functional organization is not sufficient for conscious experience. This site's framework agrees: consciousness requires something over and above functional structure—something that functional descriptions, however complete, cannot capture.

## The Phenomenal Concepts Strategy

The most sophisticated physicalist response to qualia-based arguments is the [[phenomenal-concepts-strategy]]. Rather than denying qualia exist or reducing them to functional properties, PCS locates the explanatory gap in our *concepts* rather than in reality.

The core idea: when we introspect qualia, we use *phenomenal concepts* that present experience directly, from the inside. Physical concepts like "neural state N47" present the same properties indirectly, from the outside. Both might refer to the same brain state, but they present it in radically different ways. The gap between "what it's like" and "what's happening physically" is thus a conceptual gap, not an ontological one.

This parallels the morning star / evening star case. Someone could know everything about the morning star without realizing it's the evening star—same object, different concepts. Similarly, Mary in her black-and-white room could know all physical facts without knowing what seeing red would be like. On this view, she learns a new *way of thinking* about the same physical state, not a new *fact* about a non-physical property.

However, David Chalmers's "master argument" poses a dilemma: either the features that make phenomenal concepts special are themselves physically explicable (in which case [[philosophical-zombies|zombies]] would have them too, so they can't explain why we find qualia puzzling) or they aren't physically explicable (in which case there's still an explanatory gap at the conceptual level). PCS may relocate the hard problem rather than dissolve it.

The persistence of this debate—with PCS neither refuted nor triumphant after decades of work—suggests the gap reflects something real about qualia that physical description cannot capture.

## Relation to This Site's Perspective

This site's [[tenets|Dualism tenet]] holds that consciousness is not reducible to physical processes. Qualia are a primary reason for this commitment.

The very existence of qualia—of there being something it is like to have experiences—suggests that the physical description of the world is incomplete. Physics describes structure, relations, quantities. But the redness of red is not a structure or relation—it is a quality. Either physics must expand to include qualities (which would make it unrecognisable as physics), or there is more to reality than physics captures.

The [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction tenet]] gains support from qualia too. We report our qualia—we say "that looks red" or "this coffee tastes bitter." These reports involve physical speech and writing. If qualia were causally inert (epiphenomenal), how could they influence our mouths and keyboards? The fact that we discuss qualia suggests they have causal powers.

This doesn't solve the hard problem—it doesn't explain *how* qualia arise or what they fundamentally are. But it does establish that any complete account of reality must take them seriously rather than explaining them away.
