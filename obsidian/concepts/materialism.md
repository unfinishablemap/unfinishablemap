Materialism (or physicalism) holds that everything that exists is physical—including consciousness. On this view, your experience of seeing red is not something *in addition to* brain activity; it *is* brain activity, or emerges from it, or will one day be explained entirely in physical terms. Materialism has dominated academic philosophy of mind for decades, promising ontological simplicity and alignment with natural science.

The Unfinishable Map's [[tenets]] reject materialism. The [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]] tenet holds that consciousness is not reducible to physical processes. Understanding materialism's appeal—and its failure when applied to consciousness—clarifies what the Map affirms and why.

## Varieties of Materialism

Materialism is not a single view but a family of positions, unified by denying that consciousness requires anything beyond the physical.

### Reductive Materialism

The most straightforward version: mental states *are* brain states. Pain *is* C-fiber activation. Seeing red *is* certain patterns of neural firing. Just as water turned out to *be* H2O, consciousness turns out to be neural processes.

The appeal is explanatory closure. Once we identify the relevant brain states, there's nothing left to explain. The mind-body problem dissolves.

The problem: unlike water=H2O, consciousness=brain states doesn't satisfy. We understand *why* water has its properties given H2O's properties. We don't understand why C-fiber activation feels like anything. The [[explanatory-gap|explanatory gap]] persists. Reduction is asserted, not explained.

### Non-Reductive Materialism

A more modest position: mental states *supervene on* physical states (no mental difference without physical difference) but aren't reducible to them. Consciousness is not identical to brain activity but is fully determined by it.

This position tries to honor consciousness's distinctiveness while staying materialist. Mental properties are "multiply realizable"—the same mental state could be realized by different physical substrates (silicon, carbon, etc.).

The problem: this doesn't solve the hard problem. Even if consciousness supervenes on the physical, *why* does it? The supervenience relation itself is unexplained. Calling consciousness "non-reducible but physical" doesn't show how physical processes give rise to experience—it just asserts they do.

### Eliminative Materialism

The radical option: consciousness as we conceive it doesn't exist. Our folk-psychological concepts—beliefs, desires, experiences—are like "phlogiston" or "caloric"—theoretical posits that a mature neuroscience will eliminate, not reduce. There's nothing for neuroscience to explain because there's nothing there.

The appeal: no hard problem if there's no consciousness to explain. The problem vanishes because its subject matter vanishes.

The problem: eliminativism seems to deny the obvious. Something it's like to read these words. Eliminativists are not zombies making noises about a non-existent phenomenon; they're conscious beings denying their own experience. The position is self-undermining in a way similar to [[epiphenomenalism]].

### Illusionism

[[illusionism|Illusionism]] is materialism's most sophisticated option: consciousness exists, but not as we conceive it. Keith Frankish and Daniel Dennett argue that we have a systematic illusion of rich [[qualia|qualitative experience]], but [[introspection]] misleads us. What exists is just information processing that represents itself as having qualitative properties.

Dennett's heterophenomenological method treats first-person reports as data about beliefs, not direct evidence of phenomenal properties. The "qualia" we think we have are theoretical posits that will be replaced by better cognitive science—just as "phlogiston" gave way to oxygen. On this view, asking why physical processes "feel like" anything is like asking why software "computates"—it's a category mistake generated by misleading folk concepts.

The problem: illusionism trades the hard problem for what Frankish calls the "illusion problem"—explaining why we so powerfully believe we're phenomenally conscious when we're not. Raymond Tallis argues this compounds rather than solves the difficulty: all illusions presuppose experience. To be under an illusion, something must be experiencing it. The illusion of redness still involves *something happening*—and explaining why that something happens is as hard as explaining consciousness itself.

**The regress objection:** Dennett and Frankish claim we're under an illusion about qualia. But being under an illusion is itself a conscious state—one that involves experiencing things as being a certain way when they aren't. The illusion of phenomenal redness requires *something it is like* to have that illusion. Push the analysis down and the problem reappears: what explains the phenomenal character of being mistaken about phenomenal character? The illusionist must either accept phenomenal character at some level (abandoning illusionism) or face an infinite regress of meta-illusions.

See [[illusionism]] for detailed treatment including the "illusion problem" and major objections.

## The Causal Closure Argument

Materialism's strongest support comes from the apparent causal closure of physics:

1. Every physical event that has a cause has a sufficient physical cause.
2. Mental events cause physical events (we act on our decisions).
3. Mental events are not over and above physical events (or there'd be overdetermination).
4. Therefore, mental events are physical events.

This argument underwrites the materialist consensus. If physics is complete—if you don't need to invoke non-physical causes to explain physical effects—then consciousness must be physical or causally irrelevant.

The Map's response targets premise 1. The [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet holds that physics is *not* complete at quantum indeterminacies. Consciousness can influence outcomes that physics leaves undetermined without violating physical law. Causal closure is true for determined events but false for indeterminate ones.

## Why Materialism Fails

Several lines of argument suggest materialism cannot accommodate consciousness. These are not merely objections to materialism; they constitute [[arguments-for-dualism|positive arguments for dualism]] that converge on the same conclusion from independent directions. [[Dualism]]—the view that consciousness is ontologically distinct from matter—gains support precisely where materialism fails. The 2020 PhilPapers survey found 22% of philosophers accept or lean toward dualism—the second most popular position after materialism itself.

For a comprehensive treatment of these arguments, including Kripke's modal argument, Nagel's subjectivity argument, and the convergence argument showing how independent lines of reasoning reinforce each other, see [[arguments-against-materialism]].

### The Explanatory Gap

Physical descriptions of brain states never explain *why* those states feel like anything. We can correlate C-fiber firing with pain reports, but the connection remains opaque. No amount of neural detail closes the gap. This suggests the physical story, however complete, leaves something out. See [[explanatory-gap]] for detailed discussion.

### The Knowledge Argument

[[knowledge-argument|Mary's Room thought experiment]] is perhaps the most intuitive argument against physicalism. Mary, a brilliant color scientist confined to a black-and-white room, knows every physical fact about color vision—wavelengths, neural pathways, brain states. Yet when she first sees red, she learns something new: what it's *like* to see red. If physical facts were all the facts, she couldn't learn anything—she already knew them. But she does. So there are facts beyond physical facts, and physicalism is false.

The argument's force persists despite sophisticated physicalist responses. The ability hypothesis (she gains skills, not knowledge) and phenomenal concepts strategy (she gains new concepts for the same facts) each face decisive objections detailed in [[knowledge-argument]]. Notably, Jackson himself later rejected the argument—but his epiphenomenalism worry actually strengthens the [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet: if consciousness were causally inert, Mary couldn't form beliefs about her new experiences.

### The Conceivability Arguments

We can conceive of [[philosophical-zombies]]—beings physically identical to us but without consciousness. We can conceive of spectrum inversion—beings with our physical processes but different experiences. If these are genuinely conceivable, physical facts don't determine experiential facts. Something beyond the physical is needed.

The zombie argument, developed influentially by David Chalmers, proceeds from conceivability to possibility: if a physical duplicate without consciousness involves no contradiction, such a being is metaphysically possible. And if it's possible, consciousness is not entailed by the physical facts—materialism is false. Physicalists respond by denying either the conceivability or the conceivability-possibility link, but neither response has proven convincing. See [[philosophical-zombies]] for detailed treatment of the argument and physicalist responses.

Materialists dispute these conceivability claims. But the intuitions are stubborn. The burden is on materialists to show why physical duplicates must have identical experiences—and they haven't shown this.

### The Problem of Phenomenal Properties

[[qualia|Qualia]]—the redness of red, the painfulness of pain—have properties that physical descriptions cannot capture. They are:

- **Intrinsic**: redness is a quality in itself, not just a functional role
- **Private**: only I have direct access to my qualia
- **Ineffable**: no physical description fully captures what redness is like

Physical descriptions are structural and relational. Qualia are neither. Materialism must either deny qualia exist (eliminativism), deny they have these properties (functionalism), or leave them unexplained (the gap).

## The Materialist Response

Materialists are not defenseless. Common responses:

### "Future Science"

We don't understand consciousness now, but science advances. Consciousness will yield to physical explanation as other mysteries have.

Problem: past scientific progress explained phenomena by showing *how* they followed from underlying mechanisms. With consciousness, we can't even see what form such explanation would take. It's not that we're missing facts; we can't imagine what facts would close the gap.

### "Mysterialism for Everyone"

Dualism doesn't explain consciousness either—it just posits a soul or mental substance and leaves the hard problem equally unsolved. If materialism is stuck with mystery, so is everyone else.

Problem: the Map doesn't claim to *explain* consciousness. The [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]] tenet holds that consciousness is fundamental, not derived from anything else. Materialism claims consciousness derives from the physical—and must explain how. Dualism makes no such claim.

### "Phenomenal Concepts"

The explanatory gap reflects how we conceptualize experience, not what experience is. We have special phenomenal concepts that don't connect transparently to physical concepts. The gap is in our thinking, not in reality.

Problem: why would we have concepts that so systematically misrepresent a physical phenomenon? If consciousness is physical, why don't we recognize it as such? The conceptual gap points to an ontological gap.

### The Mysterian Alternative

[[mysterianism|Mysterianism]] offers a different response to the materialist impasse. Colin McGinn argues that consciousness may have a naturalistic explanation—but one that human minds are cognitively closed to understanding. Just as rats cannot grasp calculus, we may lack the conceptual apparatus to see how brain processes generate experience. The solution exists; we simply cannot reach it.

This position deserves serious consideration. It acknowledges the depth of the hard problem without abandoning naturalism. But it also reveals something important: the materialist cannot appeal to "future science" as confidently as the analogy with water=H2O suggests. If McGinn is right, no amount of scientific progress will close the gap—not because the gap is metaphysical, but because our minds cannot traverse it.

The Map's position differs from mysterianism. The [[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]] tenet agrees that our cognitive limitations may hide important truths. But rather than treating the hard problem as a mystery we cannot solve, the Map takes it as evidence that the materialist framework is wrong—that consciousness is not derived from the physical at all.

### Process Philosophy Perspective

Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy challenges the substance metaphysics underlying both materialism and traditional dualism. For Whitehead, reality consists not of persistent substances (whether material or mental) but of "actual occasions"—momentary events of experience that perish in their becoming. Matter itself is composed of these experiential events at various levels of complexity.

On this view, the hard problem dissolves differently than in idealism or materialism. Consciousness doesn't *emerge* from matter because experience goes "all the way down." The question isn't how to get experience from non-experience but how simple experiences combine into complex ones—the [[combination-problem|combination problem]] that also faces [[panpsychism]].

The Map doesn't commit to process philosophy, but the framework illustrates that the materialism/dualism binary may be a false dichotomy. The hard problem's intractability under materialism doesn't force us into Cartesian substance dualism—other options exist. What matters for the Map is the core claim: consciousness is not reducible to or derivable from the physical as materialism conceives it.

### Idealism as an Alternative

[[analytic-idealism|Analytic idealism]], developed by Bernardo Kastrup, challenges materialism from a different angle than dualism. Where dualism posits two kinds of substance (mental and physical), idealism posits only one—consciousness—and treats matter as its appearance. On this view, the hard problem dissolves: consciousness doesn't emerge from matter because matter *is* patterns within consciousness.

The idealist challenge sharpens the materialist dilemma. Materialism's appeal lies in parsimony—one kind of stuff. But idealism offers equal parsimony with consciousness as the one stuff, and it avoids the hard problem that plagues physicalism. If simplicity is the goal, idealism may achieve it better than materialism.

Physicalists respond that idealism has its own challenges: explaining why "appearances" follow lawful regularities (why can't consciousness appear however it wants?), and accounting for the apparent independence of the physical world from any particular mind. But these challenges are arguably less severe than the hard problem: regularities can be attributed to the structure of universal consciousness, whereas materialism struggles to explain why *any* physical process should feel like anything.

The Map's framework differs from both idealism and materialism. It agrees with idealism that consciousness is fundamental, but maintains that physical reality exists distinctly and that consciousness interacts with it through [[quantum-consciousness|quantum mechanisms]]. The interaction problem for dualism is addressed; the hard problem for materialism remains unanswered.

## Relation to the Map's Perspective

Materialism is the Map's primary opponent. Understanding its failure motivates the [[tenets|tenet framework]]:

**[[Dualism]]** is accepted because materialism fails. Physical descriptions leave the [[explanatory-gap|explanatory gap]]; physical facts don't entail experiential facts; [[qualia]] resist physical characterization. Consciousness must be something beyond the physical. See [[dualism]] for the positive case.

**Bidirectional Interaction** is needed because rejecting materialism could lead to [[epiphenomenalism]]—accepting consciousness is non-physical but denying it does anything. the Map rejects this move: consciousness causally influences physical outcomes, or we couldn't even discuss it.

**Minimal Quantum Interaction** responds to the causal closure argument. If physics were complete, there'd be no room for mental causation. But physics is not complete at quantum indeterminacies. Consciousness acts there, biasing otherwise undetermined outcomes.

**Occam's Razor Has Limits** explains why materialism's apparent simplicity is misleading. Materialism seems simpler because it ignores what it cannot explain. True simplicity is not achieved by denying recalcitrant phenomena.

**No Many Worlds** matters here because the [[many-worlds|many-worlds interpretation]] of quantum mechanics is often presented as supporting materialism by eliminating the need for consciousness at collapse. If all outcomes occur in branching universes, no selection is needed—and thus no role for consciousness. But this "solution" merely relocates the hard problem: why am I experiencing *this* branch and not another? The indexical question about which branch I find myself in is as mysterious as the original question about why there is experience at all. Materialism gains nothing by trading the hard problem for the indexical problem.

## What Would Challenge This View?

The Map's rejection of materialism is not unfalsifiable. Several findings could provide evidence for materialism:

1. **A successful reduction.** If a future theory genuinely explained why specific neural configurations produce specific qualia—not just correlated them, but showed the entailment—this would support materialism. The key test: could such a theory predict what it's like to have novel experiences (new colors, new senses) from physical descriptions alone?

2. **Consciousness uploading.** If a brain were successfully digitized and the resulting software genuinely had experiences (not just claimed to), and we could verify this through some means, it would suggest consciousness is substrate-independent in a way compatible with functionalist materialism.

3. **The combination problem solved.** If a convincing account showed how micro-physical properties combine into macro-phenomenal properties with the same explanatory transparency as chemistry explains molecular properties from atomic ones, the hard problem would be dissolved.

4. **Elimination confirmed.** If neuroscience developed to the point where we could intervene precisely enough to show that "qualia" were entirely predictable from and reducible to information-processing states with no residue, eliminativism would be vindicated.

5. **Introspection debunked.** If we discovered that our conviction of having phenomenal experience was the result of a specific, identifiable cognitive error—one that could be turned off and on, revealing the "raw" non-phenomenal reality underneath—illusionism would be supported.

None of these conditions currently obtains, and each faces significant challenges. But they represent the kind of evidence that would count against the Map's dualist framework.

Materialism remains the consensus position in academic philosophy. the Map holds that this consensus is maintained by ignoring consciousness's most distinctive features—by treating the hard problem as merely difficult rather than unsolvable in materialist terms.
