Materialism (or physicalism) holds that everything that exists is physical—including consciousness. On this view, your experience of seeing red is not something *in addition to* brain activity; it *is* brain activity, or emerges from it, or will one day be explained entirely in physical terms. Materialism has dominated academic philosophy of mind for decades, promising ontological simplicity and alignment with natural science.

This site's [[tenets]] reject materialism. The [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]] tenet holds that consciousness is not reducible to physical processes. Understanding materialism's appeal—and its failure when applied to consciousness—clarifies what the site affirms and why.

## Varieties of Materialism

Materialism is not a single view but a family of positions, unified by denying that consciousness requires anything beyond the physical.

### Reductive Materialism

The most straightforward version: mental states *are* brain states. Pain *is* C-fiber activation. Seeing red *is* certain patterns of neural firing. Just as water turned out to *be* H2O, consciousness turns out to be neural processes.

The appeal is explanatory closure. Once we identify the relevant brain states, there's nothing left to explain. The mind-body problem dissolves.

The problem: unlike water=H2O, consciousness=brain states doesn't satisfy. We understand *why* water has its properties given H2O's properties. We don't understand why C-fiber activation feels like anything. The [[explanatory-gap|explanatory gap]] persists. Reduction is asserted, not explained.

### Non-Reductive Materialism

A more modest position: mental states *supervene on* physical states (no mental difference without physical difference) but aren't reducible to them. Consciousness is not identical to brain activity but is fully determined by it.

This position tries to honor consciousness's distinctiveness while staying materialist. Mental properties are "multiply realizable"—the same mental state could be realized by different physical substrates (silicon, carbon, etc.).

The problem: this doesn't solve the hard problem. Even if consciousness supervenes on the physical, *why* does it? The supervenience relation itself is unexplained. Calling consciousness "non-reducible but physical" doesn't show how physical processes give rise to experience—it just asserts they do.

### Eliminative Materialism

The radical option: consciousness as we conceive it doesn't exist. Our folk-psychological concepts—beliefs, desires, experiences—are like "phlogiston" or "caloric"—theoretical posits that a mature neuroscience will eliminate, not reduce. There's nothing for neuroscience to explain because there's nothing there.

The appeal: no hard problem if there's no consciousness to explain. The problem vanishes because its subject matter vanishes.

The problem: eliminativism seems to deny the obvious. Something it's like to read these words. Eliminativists are not zombies making noises about a non-existent phenomenon; they're conscious beings denying their own experience. The position is self-undermining in a way similar to [[epiphenomenalism]].

### Illusionism

[[illusionism|Illusionism]] is materialism's most radical option: consciousness exists, but not as we conceive it. Keith Frankish and Daniel Dennett argue that we have a systematic illusion of rich [[qualia|qualitative experience]], but introspection misleads us. What exists is just information processing that represents itself as having qualitative properties.

This explains the *appearance* of the hard problem without admitting the reality of what the hard problem is about. Dennett compared consciousness to user illusions in computer interfaces—useful fictions that don't correspond to underlying structures.

The problem: illusionism trades the hard problem for what Frankish calls the "illusion problem"—explaining why we so powerfully believe we're phenomenally conscious when we're not. Raymond Tallis argues this compounds rather than solves the difficulty: all illusions presuppose experience. To be under an illusion, something must be experiencing it. The illusion of redness still involves *something happening*—and explaining why that something happens is as hard as explaining consciousness itself.

See [[illusionism]] for detailed treatment including the "illusion problem" and major objections.

## The Causal Closure Argument

Materialism's strongest support comes from the apparent causal closure of physics:

1. Every physical event that has a cause has a sufficient physical cause.
2. Mental events cause physical events (we act on our decisions).
3. Mental events are not over and above physical events (or there'd be overdetermination).
4. Therefore, mental events are physical events.

This argument underwrites the materialist consensus. If physics is complete—if you don't need to invoke non-physical causes to explain physical effects—then consciousness must be physical or causally irrelevant.

The site's response targets premise 1. The [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet holds that physics is *not* complete at quantum indeterminacies. Consciousness can influence outcomes that physics leaves undetermined without violating physical law. Causal closure is true for determined events but false for indeterminate ones.

## Why Materialism Fails

Several lines of argument suggest materialism cannot accommodate consciousness. These are not merely objections to materialism; they constitute [[arguments-for-dualism|positive arguments for dualism]] that converge on the same conclusion from independent directions. The 2020 PhilPapers survey found 22% of philosophers accept or lean toward dualism—the second most popular position after materialism itself.

### The Explanatory Gap

Physical descriptions of brain states never explain *why* those states feel like anything. We can correlate C-fiber firing with pain reports, but the connection remains opaque. No amount of neural detail closes the gap. This suggests the physical story, however complete, leaves something out. See [[explanatory-gap]] for detailed discussion.

### The Knowledge Argument

[[knowledge-argument|Mary's Room thought experiment]] is perhaps the most intuitive argument against physicalism. Mary, a brilliant color scientist confined to a black-and-white room, knows every physical fact about color vision—wavelengths, neural pathways, brain states. Yet when she first sees red, she learns something new: what it's *like* to see red. If physical facts were all the facts, she couldn't learn anything—she already knew them. But she does. So there are facts beyond physical facts, and physicalism is false.

The argument's force persists despite sophisticated physicalist responses. The ability hypothesis (she gains skills, not knowledge) and phenomenal concepts strategy (she gains new concepts for the same facts) each face decisive objections detailed in [[knowledge-argument]]. Notably, Jackson himself later rejected the argument—but his epiphenomenalism worry actually strengthens the [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet: if consciousness were causally inert, Mary couldn't form beliefs about her new experiences.

### The Conceivability Arguments

We can conceive of [[philosophical-zombies]]—beings physically identical to us but without consciousness. We can conceive of spectrum inversion—beings with our physical processes but different experiences. If these are genuinely conceivable, physical facts don't determine experiential facts. Something beyond the physical is needed.

The zombie argument, developed influentially by David Chalmers, proceeds from conceivability to possibility: if a physical duplicate without consciousness involves no contradiction, such a being is metaphysically possible. And if it's possible, consciousness is not entailed by the physical facts—materialism is false. Physicalists respond by denying either the conceivability or the conceivability-possibility link, but neither response has proven convincing. See [[philosophical-zombies]] for detailed treatment of the argument and physicalist responses.

Materialists dispute these conceivability claims. But the intuitions are stubborn. The burden is on materialists to show why physical duplicates must have identical experiences—and they haven't shown this.

### The Problem of Phenomenal Properties

[[qualia|Qualia]]—the redness of red, the painfulness of pain—have properties that physical descriptions cannot capture. They are:

- **Intrinsic**: redness is a quality in itself, not just a functional role
- **Private**: only I have direct access to my qualia
- **Ineffable**: no physical description fully captures what redness is like

Physical descriptions are structural and relational. Qualia are neither. Materialism must either deny qualia exist (eliminativism), deny they have these properties (functionalism), or leave them unexplained (the gap).

## The Materialist Response

Materialists are not defenseless. Common responses:

### "Future Science"

We don't understand consciousness now, but science advances. Consciousness will yield to physical explanation as other mysteries have.

Problem: past scientific progress explained phenomena by showing *how* they followed from underlying mechanisms. With consciousness, we can't even see what form such explanation would take. It's not that we're missing facts; we can't imagine what facts would close the gap.

### "Mysterialism for Everyone"

Dualism doesn't explain consciousness either—it just posits a soul or mental substance and leaves the hard problem equally unsolved. If materialism is stuck with mystery, so is everyone else.

Problem: the site doesn't claim to *explain* consciousness. The [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]] tenet holds that consciousness is fundamental, not derived from anything else. Materialism claims consciousness derives from the physical—and must explain how. Dualism makes no such claim.

### "Phenomenal Concepts"

The explanatory gap reflects how we conceptualize experience, not what experience is. We have special phenomenal concepts that don't connect transparently to physical concepts. The gap is in our thinking, not in reality.

Problem: why would we have concepts that so systematically misrepresent a physical phenomenon? If consciousness is physical, why don't we recognize it as such? The conceptual gap points to an ontological gap.

### Idealism as an Alternative

[[analytic-idealism|Analytic idealism]], developed by Bernardo Kastrup, challenges materialism from a different angle than dualism. Where dualism posits two kinds of substance (mental and physical), idealism posits only one—consciousness—and treats matter as its appearance. On this view, the hard problem dissolves: consciousness doesn't emerge from matter because matter *is* patterns within consciousness.

The idealist challenge sharpens the materialist dilemma. Materialism's appeal lies in parsimony—one kind of stuff. But idealism offers equal parsimony with consciousness as the one stuff, and it avoids the hard problem that plagues physicalism. If simplicity is the goal, idealism may achieve it better than materialism.

Physicalists respond that idealism has its own challenges: explaining why "appearances" follow lawful regularities (why can't consciousness appear however it wants?), and accounting for the apparent independence of the physical world from any particular mind. But these challenges are arguably less severe than the hard problem: regularities can be attributed to the structure of universal consciousness, whereas materialism struggles to explain why *any* physical process should feel like anything.

This site's framework differs from both idealism and materialism. It agrees with idealism that consciousness is fundamental, but maintains that physical reality exists distinctly and that consciousness interacts with it through [[quantum-consciousness|quantum mechanisms]]. The interaction problem for dualism is addressed; the hard problem for materialism remains unanswered.

## Relation to This Site's Perspective

Materialism is the site's primary opponent. Understanding its failure motivates the [[tenets|tenet framework]]:

**Dualism** is accepted because materialism fails. Physical descriptions leave the [[explanatory-gap|explanatory gap]]; physical facts don't entail experiential facts; [[qualia]] resist physical characterization. Consciousness must be something beyond the physical.

**Bidirectional Interaction** is needed because rejecting materialism could lead to [[epiphenomenalism]]—accepting consciousness is non-physical but denying it does anything. The site rejects this move: consciousness causally influences physical outcomes, or we couldn't even discuss it.

**Minimal Quantum Interaction** responds to the causal closure argument. If physics were complete, there'd be no room for mental causation. But physics is not complete at quantum indeterminacies. Consciousness acts there, biasing otherwise undetermined outcomes.

**Occam's Razor Has Limits** explains why materialism's apparent simplicity is misleading. Materialism seems simpler because it ignores what it cannot explain. True simplicity is not achieved by denying recalcitrant phenomena.

Materialism remains the consensus position in academic philosophy. The site holds that this consensus is maintained by ignoring consciousness's most distinctive features—by treating the hard problem as merely difficult rather than unsolvable in materialist terms.
