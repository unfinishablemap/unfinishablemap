The Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI) holds that quantum measurement never collapses the wave function. Instead, every possible outcome occurs—the universe splits into branches, one for each possibility. The Unfinishable Map explicitly rejects MWI in the [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]] tenet. The rejection is not merely aesthetic but principled: MWI raises unanswerable questions about identity, dissolves the meaning of probability, and fails to explain why consciousness exists at all.

## What MWI Claims

Hugh Everett proposed MWI in 1957 to solve the [[measurement-problem|measurement problem]] without postulating collapse. Rather than defining when collapse occurs, Everett eliminated it: the wave function evolves unitarily forever. When a quantum system interacts with an observer, both become entangled—one branch where the observer sees outcome A, another where they see B. Both branches are equally real; every quantum possibility is realized somewhere.

The apparent elegance is real: MWI takes the mathematics literally, requiring no collapse postulate. But this elegance comes at extraordinary cost.

## Five Arguments Against MWI

### 1. Ontological Extravagance

MWI posits that for every quantum event—trillions occurring each second throughout the universe—reality branches into multiple copies, each containing a complete universe. The number of branches grows exponentially, bounded only by the universe's history.

This isn't merely "lots of universes." It's continuous ontological explosion. Each photon absorbed by each atom in each star creates new branches. The total number of branches already exceeds any number we can meaningfully write.

MWI defenders argue this is *simpler* because it has fewer laws—just the Schrödinger equation. But the [[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]] tenet reminds us that simplicity is unreliable when knowledge is incomplete. A theory positing infinite unobservable universes is not parsimonious in any intuitive sense.

### 2. The Indexical Identity Problem

Before measurement, there is one you. After measurement on MWI, there are many equally real continuations—one for each possible outcome. Yet you find yourself in exactly one branch, having exactly one experience.

The question "Why am I in *this* branch rather than that one?" seems meaningful. You will see the spin-up result or the spin-down result, not both. Your future self exists in one branch, not all of them. Which one is *you*?

MWI says this question is malformed. Both post-measurement persons are equally continuous with the pre-measurement you. There's no further fact about which branch you "really" end up in—both branches contain persons with equal claim to being you.

This doesn't match the phenomenology. Right now, you anticipate having one definite future experience, not multiple incompatible ones. The felt reality of being *this* observer expecting *one* outcome suggests a [[haecceity|haecceitistic]] truth about which branch is yours—something MWI cannot accommodate.

MWI defenders invoke self-locating uncertainty: you should be uncertain which branch you'll find yourself in. But self-locating uncertainty normally involves a single world with indexically uncertain facts. On MWI, there's no fact to be uncertain about—both outcomes are equally real, and "you" end up in both.

### 3. The Probability Problem

Quantum mechanics predicts that outcomes occur with specific probabilities given by the Born rule. On MWI, all outcomes occur. What does probability mean if everything happens?

The standard MWI strategy uses decision theory: rational agents should weight outcomes by the Born rule because that's what decision theory recommends, given the branching structure. But this faces objections:

**The measure problem**: Why should branch-counting follow the Born rule? Each branch is equally real. If there are more branches with outcome A than outcome B, why should that affect how *this* pre-measurement you should bet?

**The caring problem**: Why should the pre-measurement you care about post-measurement continuations proportionally to their Born weights? All of them exist. The branch-weighted version of you is as much "you" as any other weighting.

MWI defenders offer decision-theoretic derivations (Deutsch-Wallace) purporting to show that rational agents *must* weight outcomes by Born probabilities. But these derivations are contested—critics argue the axioms are question-begging. Deriving probability from non-probabilistic branching may be fundamentally misguided.

### 4. The Preferred Basis Problem

When a measurement occurs on MWI, the universe branches. But along which observables? Why does measuring electron spin split branches along spin-up/spin-down rather than some other basis?

The answer usually invokes decoherence: environmental interaction selects a "pointer basis" of stable, non-interfering states. This explains why we observe cats as alive-or-dead rather than in superpositions.

**The problem**: Decoherence selects bases only approximately and relative to observers. It doesn't yield unique, observer-independent branches. The branch structure—which worlds exist—depends on how you slice the wave function. This seems to make worlds less fundamental than the interpretation requires.

**Implications**: If branch structure is observer-relative, MWI faces questions similar to [[relational-quantum-mechanics|relational interpretations]]—but without RQM's explicit embrace of relationality.

### 5. Consciousness Remains Unexplained

The deepest problem: MWI explains why measurement *appears* to collapse the wave function ([[decoherence|decoherence]] hides other branches from us) but doesn't explain why there is conscious experience at all.

Every interpretation faces the [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|hard problem]]. But interpretations that give consciousness a role—selecting outcomes, modulating collapse, participating in the physics—at least connect the existence of consciousness to the physics. MWI provides no such connection.

Why do branches contain conscious observers rather than philosophical zombies? The wave function evolves unitarily; nothing in that evolution distinguishes conscious from unconscious processes. MWI is consistent with consciousness but doesn't explain it.

**For the Map**: The framework holds that consciousness participates in determining physical outcomes ([[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]). MWI explicitly denies this—consciousness plays no role in the physics; all outcomes occur regardless. This fundamental incompatibility motivates the tenet-level rejection.

## The Illusionist Challenge

[[illusionism|Illusionists]] might respond that the indexical objections depend on taking phenomenal consciousness too seriously. If experience is illusory, perhaps the problem dissolves.

But even if phenomenal consciousness is illusory, something generates the *representation* of being this particular observer anticipating this particular outcome. That representational state has its own indexical character—the illusory seeming-self still seems to be in one branch. MWI cannot accommodate the *representation* of single-future anticipation any better than the *reality* of it. The indexical problem persists whether consciousness is "real" or "illusory."

## Process Philosophy Perspective

Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy illuminates why MWI fails. For Whitehead, reality consists of "actual occasions"—momentary events that arise, achieve definiteness, and perish. Becoming *requires* achieving definiteness; a universe of perpetual superposition without genuine resolution violates the fundamental structure of process.

Whitehead distinguished between real potentiality and actualization—the selection of one possibility into definiteness. MWI collapses this distinction: all potentials are actualized in some branch, so nothing is genuinely selected. This connects to [[haecceity]]: each actual occasion has its own "thisness" that makes it this occasion rather than another. Whitehead's occasions cannot branch because haecceity is non-transferable.

## MWI's Appeal

Despite these objections, MWI attracts substantial support among physicists and philosophers. The appeal is real:

**Mathematical elegance**: No collapse postulate, just unitary evolution. The simplest interpretation of the equations.

**No measurement problem**: What "triggers" collapse? On MWI, nothing—the question dissolves.

**No superluminal signaling**: Collapse interpretations face questions about faster-than-light influence. MWI has purely local evolution.

**Determinism**: The wave function evolves deterministically. Apparent randomness is perspectival.

These are genuine virtues. The Map rejects MWI not because it's obviously wrong but because its costs—particularly for identity and meaning—outweigh its benefits.

## Viable Alternatives to MWI

MWI also claims to dissolve the [[prebiotic-collapse|prebiotic collapse problem]]—what selected quantum outcomes during 13.8 billion years before consciousness. If all outcomes occur, nothing needed selecting. But the Map's alternative is more conservative: objective reduction handled prebiotic collapse; consciousness modulates collapse only in neural systems.

The case against MWI only succeeds if scientifically respectable alternatives exist. They do. The [[quantum-measurement-interpretations-beyond-mwi|comprehensive survey of quantum interpretations]] establishes five major alternatives: Copenhagen, Bohmian mechanics, QBism, transactional/time-symmetric approaches, and objective collapse theories.

The interpretive landscape is genuinely open—surveys of physicists consistently show deep disagreement, with few confident their preferred interpretation is correct (Schlosshauer et al., 2013). The Map favors interpretations where consciousness participates in collapse (transactional, consciousness-integrated CSL), as these explain both quantum measurement outcomes and phenomenal facts. Interpretations that eliminate consciousness or treat it as purely epistemic don't explain why consciousness exists at all. See the [[quantum-measurement-interpretations-beyond-mwi|full survey]] for detailed analysis of each interpretation's compatibility with the Map's framework.

## What Would Challenge This View?

The Map's rejection of MWI is principled but not dogmatic. Conditions that would significantly weaken the case against MWI:

1. **Resolution of the probability problem.** If the Deutsch-Wallace derivation were shown compelling without question-begging axioms, the probability objection would lose force.

2. **An account of indexical identity.** If MWI defenders could explain why the question "Which branch am I in?" is confused in a way that dissolves rather than relocates the puzzle, the indexical objection would need revision.

3. **Consciousness without selection.** If the hard problem were solved in a way compatible with epiphenomenalism, the Map's bidirectional interaction commitment would need reconsideration, and MWI would become more tenable.

4. **Empirical tests favoring MWI.** If experiments produced results uniquely predicted by MWI, empirical pressure would mount.

None of these conditions currently obtain. The rejection of MWI remains well-motivated.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]] tenet encodes this rejection. The tenet's rationale emphasizes indexical identity: "Why am I *this* instance and not another? The framework provides no resources to answer this, yet the question seems meaningful."

MWI conflicts with multiple site commitments:

**Dualism**: The [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]] tenet holds that consciousness is not reducible to physical processes. MWI is consistent with dualism in principle—nothing prevents non-physical properties from accompanying physical states in every branch. But MWI provides no motivation for dualism: if consciousness plays no role in determining outcomes, its irreducibility becomes an unexplained addition rather than a theoretical requirement. Collapse interpretations, by contrast, can integrate consciousness into the physics itself.

**Minimal Quantum Interaction**: The [[tenets#^minimal-quantum|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet posits that consciousness influences physical outcomes through the smallest possible intervention—biasing quantum indeterminacies rather than violating conservation laws. MWI eliminates quantum indeterminacy entirely: nothing is undetermined because all outcomes occur. The tenet becomes inapplicable; there's nothing for consciousness to bias.

**Bidirectional Interaction**: The [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet holds that consciousness causally influences physical outcomes. MWI denies this—outcomes are determined by unitary evolution, not conscious selection. If MWI is true, [[mental-causation|mental causation]] needs a different story. Consciousness becomes either epiphenomenal (accompanying but not affecting the physics) or eliminable (not a genuine category at all).

**No Many Worlds**: This tenet directly encodes the rejection. The arguments above constitute its rationale. The indexical identity problem, the probability problem, and the failure to explain consciousness motivate rejecting MWI despite its mathematical elegance.

**Occam's Razor Has Limits**: The [[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]] tenet cautions against privileging simplicity when knowledge is incomplete. MWI defenders appeal to Occam's Razor: fewer laws (no collapse postulate) means simpler theory. But this simplicity is superficial. MWI trades ontological simplicity (one world) for law simplicity (one equation). Given our deep uncertainty about consciousness and its role in physics, preferring MWI on simplicity grounds is premature.

Alternative interpretations—particularly [[collapse-and-time|time-symmetric]] approaches—preserve these site commitments while solving the measurement problem. The interpretive landscape remains genuinely open; MWI is not forced upon us by the physics.
