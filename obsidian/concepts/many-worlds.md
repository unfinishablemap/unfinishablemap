The Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI) holds that quantum measurement never collapses the wave function. Instead, every possible outcome occurs—the universe splits into branches, one for each possibility. This site explicitly rejects MWI in the [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]] tenet. The rejection is not merely aesthetic but principled: MWI raises unanswerable questions about identity, dissolves the meaning of probability, and fails to explain why consciousness exists at all.

## What MWI Claims

Hugh Everett proposed MWI in 1957 to solve the [[measurement-problem|measurement problem]] without postulating collapse. On the standard Copenhagen view, measurement causes the wave function to "collapse" from superposition to a definite state. But when exactly? What counts as measurement? These questions have no satisfactory answer.

Everett's solution: nothing special happens at measurement. The wave function evolves unitarily forever. When a quantum system in superposition interacts with an observer, the observer doesn't collapse the system—instead, the observer becomes entangled with it. The composite system enters superposition: one branch where the observer sees outcome A, another where they see outcome B.

Both branches are equally real. From inside any branch, it *appears* that collapse occurred. But globally, the wave function just keeps evolving, branching endlessly. Every quantum possibility is realized somewhere.

The apparent elegance is real: MWI takes the mathematics of quantum mechanics literally, requiring no additional collapse postulate. But this elegance comes at extraordinary cost.

## Five Arguments Against MWI

### 1. Ontological Extravagance

MWI posits that for every quantum event—trillions occurring each second throughout the universe—reality branches into multiple copies, each containing a complete universe. The number of branches grows exponentially, bounded only by the universe's history.

This isn't merely "lots of universes." It's continuous ontological explosion. Each photon absorbed by each atom in each star creates new branches. The total number of branches already exceeds any number we can meaningfully write.

**The MWI response**: Appealing to Occam's Razor, Deutsch and others argue MWI is *simpler* because it has fewer laws—just the Schrödinger equation, no collapse postulate. Additional worlds cost nothing if they follow from the theory.

**The counter-response**: Occam's Razor concerns theoretical entities, not just equations. A theory positing infinite unobservable universes is not parsimonious in any intuitive sense. And the [[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]] tenet reminds us that simplicity is unreliable when knowledge is incomplete. MWI's mathematical simplicity may reflect our ignorance of what actually occurs at measurement.

### 2. The Indexical Identity Problem

Before measurement, there is one you. After measurement on MWI, there are many equally real continuations—one for each possible outcome. Yet you find yourself in exactly one branch, having exactly one experience.

The question "Why am I in *this* branch rather than that one?" seems meaningful. You will see the spin-up result or the spin-down result, not both. Your future self exists in one branch, not all of them. Which one is *you*?

MWI says this question is malformed. Both post-measurement persons are equally continuous with the pre-measurement you. There's no further fact about which branch you "really" end up in—both branches contain persons with equal claim to being you.

**The problem**: This doesn't match the phenomenology. Right now, you anticipate having one definite future experience, not multiple incompatible ones. The felt reality of being *this* observer expecting *one* outcome suggests an indexical fact—a [[haecceity|haecceitistic]] truth about which branch is yours—that MWI cannot accommodate.

**The MWI response (Deutsch, Carroll)**: Self-locating uncertainty explains the phenomenology. Before measurement, you should be uncertain about which branch you'll find yourself in—like being uncertain which room you woke up in. The uncertainty is real even though both outcomes occur.

**The counter-response**: Self-locating uncertainty normally involves a single world with indexically uncertain facts. But on MWI, there's no fact to be uncertain about—both outcomes are equally real, and "you" end up in both. The uncertainty framework seems inapplicable when all outcomes occur.

### 3. The Probability Problem

Quantum mechanics predicts that outcomes occur with specific probabilities given by the Born rule. On MWI, all outcomes occur. What does probability mean if everything happens?

The standard MWI strategy uses decision theory: rational agents should weight outcomes by the Born rule because that's what decision theory recommends, given the branching structure. But this faces objections:

**The measure problem**: Why should branch-counting follow the Born rule? Each branch is equally real. If there are more branches with outcome A than outcome B, why should that affect how *this* pre-measurement you should bet?

**The caring problem**: Why should the pre-measurement you care about post-measurement continuations proportionally to their Born weights? All of them exist. The branch-weighted version of you is as much "you" as any other weighting.

**The MWI response**: Decision-theoretic derivations (Deutsch-Wallace) claim to show that rational agents *must* weight outcomes by Born rule probabilities, given certain axioms about rational preference under branching.

**The counter-response**: These derivations are contested. Critics (Kent, Albert, Loewer) argue the axioms are question-begging or insufficiently motivated. The project of deriving probability from non-probabilistic branching may be fundamentally misguided.

### 4. The Preferred Basis Problem

When a measurement occurs on MWI, the universe branches. But along which observables? Why does measuring electron spin split branches along spin-up/spin-down rather than some other basis?

The answer usually invokes decoherence: environmental interaction selects a "pointer basis" of stable, non-interfering states. This explains why we observe cats as alive-or-dead rather than in superpositions.

**The problem**: Decoherence selects bases only approximately and relative to observers. It doesn't yield unique, observer-independent branches. The branch structure—which worlds exist—depends on how you slice the wave function. This seems to make worlds less fundamental than the interpretation requires.

**Implications**: If branch structure is observer-relative, MWI faces questions similar to [[relational-quantum-mechanics|relational interpretations]]—but without RQM's explicit embrace of relationality.

### 5. Consciousness Remains Unexplained

The deepest problem: MWI explains why measurement *appears* to collapse the wave function (decoherence hides other branches from us) but doesn't explain why there is conscious experience at all.

Every interpretation faces the [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|hard problem]]. But interpretations that give consciousness a role—selecting outcomes, modulating collapse, participating in the physics—at least connect the existence of consciousness to the physics. MWI provides no such connection.

Why do branches contain conscious observers rather than philosophical zombies? The wave function evolves unitarily; nothing in that evolution distinguishes conscious from unconscious processes. MWI is consistent with consciousness but doesn't explain it.

**For this site**: The framework holds that consciousness participates in determining physical outcomes ([[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]). MWI explicitly denies this—consciousness plays no role in the physics; all outcomes occur regardless. This fundamental incompatibility motivates the tenet-level rejection.

## MWI's Appeal

Despite these objections, MWI attracts significant support. A 2025 Nature Physics survey found substantial (though not majority) physicist support. The appeal is real:

**Mathematical elegance**: No collapse postulate, just unitary evolution. The simplest interpretation of the equations.

**No measurement problem**: What "triggers" collapse? On MWI, nothing—the question dissolves.

**No superluminal signaling**: Collapse interpretations face questions about faster-than-light influence. MWI has purely local evolution.

**Determinism**: The wave function evolves deterministically. Apparent randomness is perspectival.

These are genuine virtues. This site rejects MWI not because it's obviously wrong but because its costs—particularly for identity and meaning—outweigh its benefits.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]] tenet encodes this rejection. The tenet's rationale emphasizes indexical identity: "Why am I *this* instance and not another? The framework provides no resources to answer this, yet the question seems meaningful."

MWI conflicts with multiple site commitments:

**Bidirectional Interaction**: The site holds that consciousness causally influences physical outcomes. MWI denies this—outcomes are determined by unitary evolution, not conscious selection. If MWI is true, [[mental-causation|mental causation]] needs a different story.

**Free Will**: The site's [[free-will|free will framework]] proposes that consciousness selects among quantum possibilities. On MWI, all possibilities are realized. Selection is illusory—every choice, its alternative, and every combination thereof occurs. The phenomenology of choice-making becomes systematically misleading.

**Meaningful Probability**: The site treats quantum probability as reflecting genuine indeterminacy that consciousness might bias. On MWI, probability is either purely epistemic (self-locating uncertainty) or purely decision-theoretic. Neither connects probability to ontological openness.

Alternative interpretations—particularly [[collapse-and-time|time-symmetric]] approaches like the transactional interpretation—preserve these site commitments while solving the measurement problem. The interpretive landscape remains open; MWI is not forced upon us by the physics.
