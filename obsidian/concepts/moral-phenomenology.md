Moral phenomenology is the philosophical study of what moral experience feels like from the inside. It asks: what is the phenomenal character of encountering wrongness, feeling obligated, admiring courage, or suffering guilt? The Unfinishable Map holds that these questions matter because moral experience has distinctive [[qualia]] that resist reduction to physical or functional description. If the felt wrongness of cruelty is a genuine phenomenal property — not merely an emotional reaction labelled "moral" after the fact — then moral phenomenology provides primary data about the evaluative structure of consciousness.

## Scope and Distinctions

Moral phenomenology occupies a specific position within a cluster of related concepts on the Map. Clarifying these boundaries prevents confusion.

**[[phenomenology]]** is the broader tradition of first-person investigation of consciousness. Moral phenomenology applies this tradition to a specific domain: the moral.

**[[normative-phenomenology]]** investigates all normative experience — epistemic, aesthetic, prudential, and moral. Moral phenomenology is one branch of this wider programme, focused exclusively on the ethical.

**[[moral-perception]]** is a capacity claim: that ethical properties can be directly perceived rather than inferred. Moral phenomenology is the descriptive investigation of what moral perceiving (and other moral experiences) feel like, without committing in advance to whether what is experienced constitutes perception in the technical sense.

**[[phenomenal-normativity]]** is the metaphysical thesis that certain phenomenal states carry intrinsic normative force. Moral phenomenology is the descriptive enterprise that produces evidence relevant to this thesis without presupposing it.

Moral phenomenology is therefore the foundational descriptive work: careful first-person investigation of moral experience that informs — but does not settle — questions about moral perception, phenomenal normativity, and normative phenomenology more broadly.

## The Phenomenal Character of Moral Experience

### Wrongness

Witnessing cruelty produces an experience with identifiable phenomenal character. The wrongness presents itself as a feature of the situation — belonging to the act, not merely to the observer's reaction. This presentational quality distinguishes moral experience from generic discomfort. Stubbing one's toe is unpleasant; witnessing cruelty is unpleasant in a way that includes a quality of *shouldn't be*.

The wrongness also carries directionality. It is not a diffuse negative feeling but targets the act or agent responsible. This intentional structure — wrongness *of* something — parallels the intentionality of perception generally but involves evaluative rather than sensory content.

### Obligation

The experience of obligation has a phenomenal profile distinct from both wrongness and desire. Obligation presents itself as a demand that originates outside one's preferences — a felt practical necessity rather than an inclination. The person who wants to help and the person who feels they *must* help have different experiences even when they act identically.

Kant characterised this as reason's authority over inclination. Moral phenomenology notes the datum without committing to Kant's explanation: something in the experience presents itself as binding regardless of what one happens to want.

### Moral Admiration

Positive moral experiences also have distinctive phenomenal character. Witnessing integrity under pressure produces moral admiration — a state distinguishable from aesthetic appreciation, hedonic pleasure, or social approval. Moral admiration involves perceiving a person or action as exemplary in a way that invites emulation, carrying what the [[phenomenology-of-moral-experience|topic article]] describes as "moral luminosity."

### Guilt and Moral Remainder

Guilt is perhaps the most phenomenologically transparent moral experience. It combines backward-looking awareness of a wrong one has done, a quality of personal responsibility, and temporal persistence that distinguishes it from both regret (which attaches to outcomes) and shame (which concerns one's standing). Particularly revealing are cases of moral remainder — the guilt that persists after making the correct choice in a tragic dilemma, tracking genuine moral costs that the right decision did not eliminate.

## Why Moral Phenomenology Matters

### For Metaethics

Moral phenomenology constrains metaethical theory by providing data that any adequate account must accommodate. If wrongness consistently presents itself as a perceived property of situations rather than a projected emotion, theories that treat morality as pure projection must explain why experience systematically misrepresents its own structure. If obligation presents as external demand rather than internal preference, expressivist accounts face a phenomenological deficit.

This does not settle metaethical debates — evolutionary debunking arguments (Street 2006) show that natural selection could produce experience that feels objective regardless of whether objective normativity exists. But it raises the evidential bar: dismissing moral phenomenology requires independent grounds, not merely an alternative causal story.

### For Philosophy of Mind

Moral phenomenology extends the hard problem into the evaluative domain. The gap between neural activation during moral perception and the felt quality of perceiving wrongness is a specific instance of the explanatory gap. No description of amygdala firing patterns or prefrontal cortex engagement captures *what it is like* to experience moral outrage. If the hard problem is genuine for sensory [[qualia]], it is equally genuine for moral qualia.

This makes moral phenomenology relevant to the consciousness debate beyond ethics. The variety and specificity of moral phenomenal states — that wrongness feels different from obligation, which feels different from admiration — provides additional evidence that phenomenal character is richly structured and resists functional reduction.

### For Contemplative Investigation

Moral phenomenology can be deepened through sustained attention. Contemplative traditions report that trained observation reveals moral microstructure invisible to casual introspection. Buddhist *mettā* practice stabilises the phenomenal quality of goodwill; Simone Weil's concept of attention locates moral perception in sustained receptivity. If moral experience were mere projection, extended contemplative attention should reveal the projection mechanism. Practitioners report the opposite: deeper attention reveals more moral texture, not less. (The Map notes that Buddhist metaphysics interprets this through dependent origination rather than dualism; the phenomenological observations are separable from the metaphysical frameworks within which traditions interpret them.)

## Relation to Site Perspective

Moral phenomenology connects to the Map's [[tenets|foundational commitments]] at several points.

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]**: If moral experience has irreducible phenomenal character — if the felt wrongness of cruelty cannot be exhaustively described in functional or neural terms — then moral phenomenology extends the case for dualism into the evaluative domain. The explanatory gap is not confined to sensory qualia; it runs through the full range of conscious experience, including its moral dimension.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]**: Moral experience motivates action. People sacrifice comfort and safety because of how moral situations feel. This motivational power presupposes that consciousness causally shapes behaviour. If moral phenomenology were epiphenomenal — if the felt wrongness of injustice played no role in producing protest — the consistent link between moral experience and moral action would be inexplicable.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]**: Reducing moral phenomenology to evolutionary fitness signalling seems parsimonious. But this parsimony is achieved by dismissing the primary data — what moral experience is actually like when carefully investigated. The apparent simplicity of projectivism may reflect the limitations of the reductive framework rather than the absence of moral qualia.
