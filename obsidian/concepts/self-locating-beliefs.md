Self-locating beliefs are beliefs about where or who you are in the world, as opposed to beliefs about what the world is like. You can know every impersonal fact about the universe—every particle's position, every causal relation, every event's timing—and still lack self-locating knowledge. The distinction matters for consciousness: if self-locating beliefs track genuine [[indexical-facts|indexical facts]], then reality includes more than third-person description can capture.

## The Distinction

Epistemologists distinguish two kinds of belief:

**Ordinary beliefs**: Beliefs about what the world contains and how things are arranged. "There is a person in London." "The electron has spin-up." "Conscious beings exist." These can be stated in purely impersonal, context-free language.

**Self-locating beliefs**: Beliefs about which part of reality you occupy. "I am in London." "I am the person seeing this." "This experience is mine." These require indexicals—words like "I," "here," "now"—that shift reference depending on who uses them.

John Perry's supermarket example illustrates the difference. You notice a trail of sugar on the floor and think: "Someone is making a mess with a torn bag." This is an ordinary belief—impersonal, about what's happening somewhere in the store. Then you look down and realise: "I am making the mess." This self-locating belief changes everything. Same world, same facts, but a new piece of knowledge that the impersonal description didn't contain.

The cognitive and motivational difference is stark. Knowing "someone is making a mess" doesn't prompt you to check your own cart. Knowing "I am making the mess" immediately does. Perry argues this shows self-locating beliefs are not reducible to ordinary beliefs—they add something no impersonal description provides.

## Lewis's Two Gods

David Lewis's "Two Gods" scenario makes the point with maximal force. Two omniscient gods know every impersonal fact about the universe: every particle's position, every event's timing, every causal law. Their knowledge is complete by any third-person standard.

Yet each god might not know which god they are.

One god resides on the tallest mountain; the other in the deepest ocean. All the impersonal facts are the same from both perspectives—the complete physical description doesn't privilege either location. The mountain god knows "one god is on the mountain and one in the ocean." What this god doesn't know from impersonal facts alone is: "I am the mountain god."

This self-locating knowledge requires something beyond omniscience about the world's structure. Even knowing everything about *what* exists, you can be ignorant about *where you are* among what exists.

## Relation to Indexical Facts

Self-locating beliefs express [[indexical-facts]]—facts that can only be stated using indexicals. If self-locating beliefs were merely a different way of knowing ordinary facts, they could in principle be translated into impersonal terms. Lewis's scenario suggests otherwise: the self-locating fact "I am the mountain god" is not derivable from any set of impersonal facts about gods and mountains.

This has implications for metaphysics. Christian List argues that irreducible indexical facts provide evidence against "third-personal metaphysics"—any picture that treats reality as fully describable without indexicals. If physics describes the universe in context-free terms, yet self-locating knowledge adds something physics doesn't contain, then physics is incomplete.

The connection to [[haecceity]] runs deep. Haecceity is the primitive "thisness" that makes something *this* particular thing rather than another qualitatively identical thing. Self-locating beliefs track haecceitistic facts—the fact that *I* am this subject, that *this* experience is happening to me. The Two Gods differ not in any qualitative property but in which one each is—a difference in haecceity that self-locating knowledge captures.

## The Sleeping Beauty Problem

The Sleeping Beauty problem has become a test case for theories of self-locating belief. Beauty is put to sleep on Sunday. A fair coin is flipped. If heads, she wakes Monday and the experiment ends. If tails, she wakes Monday, has her memory erased, then wakes again Tuesday (experiencing what feels like the same Monday awakening).

Upon waking, Beauty knows the experimental setup. What probability should she assign to the coin having landed heads?

**Thirders** say 1/3. There are three possible awakening experiences (heads-Monday, tails-Monday, tails-Tuesday), and she should treat them as equally likely.

**Halfers** say 1/2. The coin is fair; no new evidence has arrived; she should stick with the prior probability.

The disagreement reveals something about self-locating uncertainty. Beauty doesn't lack any impersonal fact—she knows the setup, knows the coin is fair, knows the possible outcomes. What she lacks is self-locating knowledge: which awakening is this? Is it Monday or Tuesday? Heads-world or tails-world?

Whether self-locating uncertainty behaves like ordinary uncertainty—whether it follows standard probability rules—remains contested. But the problem shows that self-location is a distinctive epistemic category.

## Self-Location and Many-Worlds

The [[many-worlds]] interpretation makes all quantum outcomes equally real—when a measurement occurs, the universe branches into all possibilities. This creates a peculiar situation for self-locating beliefs.

Before you look at a quantum measurement, there is one you. After branching, there are multiple successors in different branches, each continuous with your pre-measurement self. Everettians propose that your pre-measurement uncertainty about which outcome you'll see is "self-locating uncertainty"—uncertainty about which branch you're in, analogous to Beauty's uncertainty about which awakening she's experiencing.

The Map's [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]] tenet rejects this move, for several reasons:

**The framework mismatch**: Self-locating uncertainty normally presupposes a single reality with indexically uncertain facts. Beauty is in *one* awakening; she just doesn't know which. In many-worlds, you end up in *all* branches equally. There is no single branch you're "really" in while being uncertain which it is. The uncertainty framework seems inapplicable when all outcomes occur.

**The haecceitistic problem**: If personal identity is constituted by [[haecceity]]—primitive thisness—then "which branch am I in?" asks about a haecceitistic fact. But many-worlds provides no such facts. All branches are equally real, all successors equally continuous with you. There is nothing to ground the self-locating belief "I am in this branch" rather than "I am in all branches."

**The phenomenological mismatch**: You will experience one definite sequence of outcomes, not multiple incompatible ones. The felt reality of anticipating one future—not many—suggests an indexical fact that many-worlds cannot accommodate.

Self-locating uncertainty in many-worlds faces the dilemma: either there are genuine self-locating facts (which MWI denies) or there is no genuine uncertainty (which makes decision theory inapplicable).

## Implications for Consciousness

Self-locating beliefs have special significance for consciousness:

**The priority of self-location**: Before you can wonder whether others are conscious, you must know which subject you are. Self-locating knowledge is presupposed by every other question you can ask about minds.

**The [[vertiginous-question]]**: Why, of all conscious beings, am I *this* one? This is a question about self-location in the space of subjects. Knowing all impersonal facts about conscious beings doesn't tell you which one's experiences are yours.

**First-person access**: Your knowledge of your own experiences is not arrived at through inference from impersonal facts. You don't conclude "I am in pain" by observing brain states. The self-locating knowledge is immediate—and this immediacy suggests it tracks something that third-person description misses.

**Teleportation thought experiments**: If you are scanned, destroyed, and reconstructed on Mars, the replica has all your qualitative properties. But is "I am this person" true when you think it on Mars? Self-locating beliefs bring out what's at stake: not whether a qualitative duplicate exists, but whether *you*—this subject—survive.

## Objections

**"Self-location reduces to ordinary belief"**: Perhaps "I am the mountain god" just means "the utterer of this token is the mountain god"—a statement that could in principle be cashed out impersonally.

*Response*: This translation loses the motivational role. Knowing "the utterer of this token is making a mess" doesn't prompt you to check your cart the way knowing "I am making the mess" does. The indexical seems cognitively essential, not just linguistically convenient.

**"Self-locating uncertainty is just ignorance"**: Perhaps self-locating beliefs don't track special facts—they just reflect incomplete information about ordinary facts.

*Response*: The Two Gods know all impersonal facts. Their ignorance isn't about what exists or how things are arranged—it's about where they fit in what exists. If this were ordinary ignorance, specifying more impersonal facts would resolve it. But no additional third-person information tells the mountain god "you are the mountain god."

**"This generates skepticism"**: If self-locating knowledge is irreducible, how can we ever be sure of it?

*Response*: Self-locating knowledge is typically the most certain knowledge we have. You don't infer that you exist or that this experience is yours—it's given directly. The philosophical problem is explaining this certainty, not defending it.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Self-locating beliefs connect to several of the Map's [[tenets]]:

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]**: If self-locating beliefs track irreducible indexical facts—facts not derivable from physics—then physical description is incomplete. The fact that *this* subject exists, experiencing from *this* perspective, is part of what dualism says physics cannot capture.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]**: The many-worlds interpretation cannot ground self-locating beliefs. If all outcomes are equally real, there is no fact about which branch you're in—yet you anticipate one definite future. The Map rejects MWI partly because self-locating beliefs seem meaningful in ways MWI cannot accommodate.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]**: Your self-locating beliefs influence your actions. "I am the one making the mess" prompts checking your cart. If consciousness were epiphenomenal, self-locating beliefs couldn't cause behaviour. The fact that they do suggests consciousness is causally efficacious.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]**: Eliminating indexical facts might seem parsimonious—fewer kinds of facts, simpler ontology. But Lewis's Two Gods shows this parsimony comes at a cost: it cannot explain self-locating knowledge. Simplicity that eliminates genuine phenomena is not intellectual virtue.
