If dualism is true—if consciousness is genuinely distinct from physical processes—then information occupies an awkward position. Physics treats information as physical (Landauer's principle shows that erasing a bit produces measurable heat). Consciousness treats information as experiential (seeing red carries qualitative content no structural description captures). The Unfinishable Map argues that understanding information's ontological status under dualism is not a side question but a central one: information is the medium through which mind and matter interact, and its metaphysical nature constrains what that interaction can look like.

This article examines where information sits in a dualist ontology. For how physics has elevated information to a fundamental role, see [[consciousness-and-the-physics-of-information]]. For the laws governing mind-matter interaction, see [[psychophysical-laws]].

## The Ontological Question

Shannon information—the mathematical framework underlying modern information theory—is deliberately silent on meaning. A bit measures distinguishability: how much uncertainty a message resolves. Shannon (1948) was explicit that "the semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem." This abstraction made information theory extraordinarily powerful, but it also made information metaphysically slippery.

Under physicalism, the question of information's ontological status is straightforward. Information is a physical quantity—patterns in matter and energy that can be measured, transmitted, and destroyed. A thermostat processes information. A rock encodes information about the forces that shaped it. Consciousness, on this view, is just a particular kind of information processing, and information is ontologically unified.

Under dualism, this unity fractures. There is physical information (the state of neurons, the position of electrons) and there is phenomenal information (the redness of red, the felt quality of deciding). These cannot be identical if dualism is true. The question becomes: are they two instances of the same fundamental category, two completely different things misleadingly given the same name, or something else entirely?

## Four Options for Information's Status

### Option 1: Information Is Purely Physical

On this view, "information" properly refers only to physical patterns and correlations. What we call phenomenal "information" is a metaphor—consciousness has qualitative content, but calling that content "information" stretches the term beyond its legitimate scope.

The advantage is ontological clarity. Information is physical, consciousness is non-physical, and the interaction between them is a question about how non-physical consciousness interfaces with physical information patterns (which is the [[the-interface-specification-problem|interface specification problem]]).

The difficulty is that this makes the relationship between consciousness and information entirely mysterious. When someone experiences the colour red, their visual cortex carries physical information about wavelength. Their consciousness carries the quale of redness. If these are utterly different kinds of thing, why do they correlate so precisely? Calling phenomenal content "not really information" doesn't dissolve the correspondence—it just refuses to name it.

### Option 2: Information Is Purely Mental

Berkeley and other idealists would place information on the mental side: all structure is structure *of* experience, and physical "information" is a pattern within mind. This is coherent but conflicts with the Map's tenets. The Map holds that both consciousness and physical reality are genuine—dualism means *two* real domains, not one domain reduced to the other.

### Option 3: Information as Neutral Ground

Chalmers's "double-aspect theory of information" gestures at this option. Information is neither purely physical nor purely mental but a more fundamental category from which both aspects emerge. Physical information and phenomenal information are two faces of the same underlying reality.

This echoes [[russellian-monism|Russellian monism's]] proposal that physics captures only structure while something more fundamental—quiddities—underlies both the structural and the experiential. If information is the neutral ground, dualism is not substance dualism (two kinds of stuff) but aspect dualism (two aspects of one informational reality).

The attraction is that it explains why physical and phenomenal information correlate: they are the same thing viewed from different perspectives. The difficulty—which Chalmers acknowledged—is specifying the scope. Does *all* information have a phenomenal aspect? If so, the position collapses into [[panpsychism]], and thermostats experience. If only *some* information has a phenomenal aspect, what distinguishes the conscious from the non-conscious? The neutral ground becomes less neutral than it appeared.

### Option 4: Information as Interface Medium

The Map's preferred position. Information is the *medium of interaction* between consciousness and the physical world—not the substance of either domain but the language they share. On this view:

- Physical information is real and physical—patterns in matter and energy governed by physical law.
- Phenomenal content is real and non-physical—the qualitative character of conscious experience.
- Information serves as the interface because consciousness interacts with the physical world by biasing which physical information states become actual (through [[psychophysical-laws#attention|quantum selection]]).

This preserves genuine dualism (mind and matter remain distinct) while explaining why information appears in both domains: it is the point of contact. Just as a translator is neither French nor English but operates in both languages, information operates across the mind-matter boundary without belonging exclusively to either side. The Map's account of [[adaptive-computational-depth|adaptive computational depth]] extends this: the informational resolution of reality varies with conscious engagement, concentrating detail where consciousness attends.

## The Syntax-Semantics Divide

The deepest challenge for any metaphysics of information under dualism is the gap between syntax and semantics. Physical information is syntactic—it concerns patterns, correlations, and distinguishability without inherent meaning. Phenomenal experience is semantic—it carries meaning, relevance, and qualitative significance.

Under physicalism, this gap is supposed to dissolve: meaning emerges from computational complexity, and semantics reduces to sufficiently elaborate syntax. But this is precisely what the [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|hard problem]] shows cannot work. No amount of syntactic complexity explains why a pattern *means* something to the system processing it. A sufficiently complex thermostat processes information with great syntactic sophistication. It does not *understand* temperature.

Dualism takes this gap seriously. Physical information is syntactic; consciousness supplies semantics. The brain processes patterns; the mind grasps meanings. This division has a natural consequence: the causal role of consciousness is precisely to bring semantic content to bear on physical processes. When you choose to raise your arm because the situation *means* something to you, consciousness is injecting semantic relevance into a physical causal chain that, left to itself, operates only syntactically.

This connects to the Map's [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet. The argument from reportability—that our ability to discuss consciousness proves it causally influences the physical world—gains force when framed informationally. We don't just *process* information about consciousness; we *understand* what consciousness is and report on that understanding. That understanding is semantic. If the physical world is purely syntactic, the semantic content must come from somewhere. Consciousness is the source.

## Information, Causation, and the Exclusion Problem

A persistent objection to interactionist dualism is the *causal exclusion problem*: if every physical event has a sufficient physical cause, there is no causal work left for consciousness to do. Information-theoretic framing sharpens this objection but also suggests a response.

The sharpened objection: physical information processing in the brain is causally complete. Every neural state follows from prior neural states according to physical law. Consciousness is informationally redundant—the brain's physical information is sufficient to determine its behaviour.

The response from the Map's framework: physical information processing is *not* causally complete at quantum indeterminacies. Where quantum mechanics leaves outcomes undetermined, no amount of physical information determines which outcome occurs. Consciousness acts at precisely these gaps—biasing which of several physically permitted outcomes becomes actual. The information contributed by consciousness is not redundant because the physical information was *insufficient*. For how this plays out through attention as the selection mechanism, see [[attention-as-causal-bridge|the attention-as-causal-bridge model]].

This is not a god-of-the-gaps argument in the usual sense. The gaps are not due to ignorance of physical law but are structural features of quantum mechanics itself. The indeterminacy is not epistemic (we don't know the outcome) but ontological (there is no fact about the outcome until measurement). Consciousness fills a genuine ontological vacancy, not an epistemic one. The standard objection—that [[decoherence]] destroys quantum superpositions too rapidly for neural-scale effects—targets the *mechanism* but not the *principle*: even after decoherence selects a measurement basis, the outcome within that basis remains undetermined and available for conscious selection (see [[consciousness-and-causal-powers]] for the detailed framework).

## What Information Cannot Be Under Dualism

Several popular positions on information become untenable if dualism is true:

**Information cannot be substrate-independent in the strong sense.** The functionalist claim that "the same information" can be realised in any physical substrate implies that information is purely structural—and if purely structural, it cannot carry phenomenal content. Under dualism, the *physical* aspect of information may be substrate-independent (a bit is a bit whether stored in silicon or carbon), but the *phenomenal* aspect is tied to the specific interface between consciousness and its physical substrate. This is why the Map rejects [[functionalism|organisational invariance]]: substrate matters because the mind-matter interface depends on the specific physics of the substrate.

**Information cannot be identical to consciousness.** [[integrated-information-theory|Integrated Information Theory]] identifies consciousness with integrated information (Φ). Under dualism, this is a category error. Consciousness is ontologically distinct from any physical quantity, however sophisticated. IIT's Φ may *correlate* with consciousness—may even be a necessary condition for consciousness to interface with a physical system—but it cannot *be* consciousness.

**Information cannot be ontologically fundamental in a way that dissolves the mind-matter distinction.** If information is the fundamental substance and mind and matter are both "made of" information, dualism collapses into a form of neutral monism. The Map holds that the mind-matter distinction is real, not a perspectival artefact of some deeper informational unity.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The metaphysics of information connects to each of the Map's tenets.

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]** requires that information not serve as a reductive bridge collapsing mind into matter. The Map treats information as the interface medium—the point of contact between two genuinely distinct domains—rather than a neutral substance from which both derive. This preserves irreducibility while explaining correlation.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]** constrains the informational bandwidth of the mind-matter interface. If consciousness biases quantum outcomes, each bias is one bit of information injected into the physical world. The minimality principle says: the smallest informational contribution that permits downward causation. Recent work suggesting conscious processing operates at roughly 10 bits per second (Zheng & Meister 2025) provides an empirical constraint on this bandwidth—remarkably low compared to the brain's ~10 billion bits per second of sensory processing, suggesting that consciousness acts as a narrow semantic bottleneck rather than a high-throughput channel.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]** gains informational specificity. Physical information flows upward to consciousness (we perceive the world). Semantic information flows downward through consciousness's selection among quantum outcomes (we act on what the world *means*). Both directions are informational, but the character of information differs in each direction—syntactic upward, semantic downward.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]** has informational consequences. If all quantum branches are real (many-worlds), information is never lost—every outcome persists somewhere. If collapse is real (the Map's position), information is genuinely *selected*—one outcome becomes actual and alternatives are foreclosed. Consciousness's role is not merely to index which branch "this" observer inhabits but to determine which informational state becomes the single actual one.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]** applies to the widespread assumption that Shannon information exhausts what information is. Shannon information is syntactic—a measure of distinguishability and uncertainty reduction. If consciousness brings genuine semantic content, then information is richer than Shannon's framework captures. The parsimony of treating all information as syntactic may reflect conceptual limitation, not ontological truth.
