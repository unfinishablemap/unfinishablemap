Phenomenal normativity is the view that certain phenomenal experiences carry intrinsic normative force built into their very phenomenal character. Pain is bad not because we judge it bad or because evolution programmed us to avoid it, but because badness is constitutive of what pain feels like. Pleasure is good because goodness is manifest in the experience of pleasure itself.

This contrasts with non-normative theories of valence that treat the positive and negative qualities of experiences as purely descriptive features. On those views, "pain is bad" requires an additional normative premise—perhaps evolutionary (organisms that avoid pain survive) or preferential (we desire to avoid pain). Phenomenal normativity denies this separation: the normative and phenomenal are not two features requiring connection, but one feature directly accessible in experience.

## The Normative Qualia Thesis

Sharon Hewitt Rawlette's doctoral dissertation "Normative Qualia and Robust Moral Realism" (2008) provides systematic development. The core claim: certain [[qualia]]—specifically hedonic qualia like pleasure and pain—are "normative qualia." Their phenomenal character just is their normative character.

When you attend to what pain feels like—not abstractly, but in lived experience—you are attending to something bad. The badness is not inferred from the pain, added by judgment, or projected onto neutral sensation. The badness is what you're directly acquainted with in experiencing pain. Similarly for pleasure: the goodness is not a separate property correlated with pleasantness; it is the very thing you're experiencing when you attend to the pleasure.

### Direct Acquaintance with Value

This builds on the distinction between [[acquaintance-knowledge|knowledge by acquaintance]] and knowledge by description. We don't know pain is bad through description or inference—we are directly acquainted with its badness through experience. The [[knowledge-argument]] (Mary's Room) establishes that phenomenal knowledge exceeds physical description. Phenomenal normativity extends this: normative knowledge—at least concerning hedonic value—also exceeds description. You cannot fully know pain is bad without experiencing pain.

The transparency of normativity in experience distinguishes phenomenal normativity from other identity claims. Water and H₂O are metaphysically identical but epistemically distinct—you need empirical investigation to discover the identity. But pleasure and goodness are both epistemically and (the view claims) metaphysically unified. When experiencing pleasure, you have direct access to both its phenomenal and normative aspects because they're the same aspect.

## Relation to Phenomenal Value Realism

Phenomenal normativity is the foundation for [[phenomenal-value-realism]]—the metaethical view that intrinsic value is grounded in conscious experience. But the concepts are distinct:

**Phenomenal normativity** is a claim about experience: certain phenomenal states have normative character built in.

**Phenomenal value realism** is a claim about value: intrinsic value is constituted by normative phenomenal states.

You could hold phenomenal normativity for hedonic experiences while denying phenomenal value realism globally—perhaps holding that other values (knowledge, beauty, virtue) are not phenomenally constituted. Conversely, you might hold phenomenal value realism while being skeptical that normativity is truly *intrinsic* to phenomenal character rather than projected.

The Map holds both: phenomenal normativity is correct about valence, and [[phenomenal-value-realism#The Map's Position: Phenomenal Value Pluralism|phenomenal value pluralism]] extends the insight to multiple features of experience (meaning, agency, understanding, aesthetic quality, connection).

## The Is-Ought Bridge

Hume famously argued you cannot derive normative conclusions ("ought") from purely descriptive premises ("is"). Phenomenal normativity challenges this separation by denying that phenomenal experiences are purely descriptive.

If pain's badness is constitutive of what pain *is*—not an evaluative overlay—then attending to pain already puts you in contact with a normative fact. The gap between is and ought doesn't appear because the phenomenal "is" already contains normativity.

Critics respond that this conflates epistemic and metaphysical issues. Even if experiences *seem* normative, this doesn't establish that normativity is metaphysically real rather than projected. The [[illusionism]] response takes this further: perhaps phenomenal consciousness itself is illusory, making phenomenal normativity doubly suspect.

### The Coherence Test

One argument for phenomenal normativity appeals to conceptual coherence: "This pain is pleasant" would be incoherent—suggesting the speaker means something non-standard by "pain" or "pleasant." Similarly, "This pleasure is intrinsically bad" seems incoherent in a way that "This water is not H₂O" is not (the latter was coherent before empirical discovery).

But coherence tests prove semantic connections, not metaphysical identity. It might be analytic that pain is typically unpleasant without pain and badness being the same property. The stronger claim—metaphysical identity—requires additional phenomenological argument: that attending to pain reveals no residual question about why it's bad.

## The Phenomenological Argument

The strongest case for phenomenal normativity comes from first-person investigation. When experiencing intense pain and asking "is *this* bad?"—attending directly to the phenomenal character—the question appears to close. The badness is not inferred or added; it's manifest in what you're attending to.

This differs from other evaluative questions. "Is *this* act wrong?" admits genuine doubt even while fully attending to the act. But "Is *this* pain bad?" while attending to pain's phenomenal character appears to admit only doubt about metaethical theories (error theory, non-cognitivism), not about the pain's badness itself.

[[introspection|Introspective]] access provides evidence but not proof. Introspection can mislead—we might introspect normativity that's actually projected rather than constitutive. But the phenomenological claim is that the normativity of pain survives rigorous first-person investigation in a way that many introspective judgments do not.

### Contemplative Evidence

[[witness-consciousness|Contemplative traditions]] provide additional phenomenological data. Meditators report observing valence directly—not as attribution but as constituent of experience. In Buddhist phenomenology, *vedanā* (feeling tone) is one of the five aggregates constituting experience. It is not judgment about experience; it is part of the structure of experience itself.

Advanced meditators can attend to valence while suspending evaluative judgment about whether they should pursue or avoid states. They report that valence persists even when meta-attitudes are suspended. This supports that normativity is in the experience, not in reactions to experience.

## Challenges and Objections

### The Illusionist Challenge

[[illusionism|Illusionism]] denies phenomenal consciousness has the properties we attribute to it. If phenomenal consciousness is functional-representational all the way down, phenomenal normativity has no referent.

**Response**: Illusionism faces the regress problem. Something must *seem* a certain way for the illusion to occur. If the seeming itself has no phenomenal character, there's no one to be deceived. If it does have phenomenal character, that character includes the normative seeming—which is what phenomenal normativity claims.

The badness of suffering is directly present in suffering itself, not mediated by introspective judgment. Illusionists can question whether pain has all properties we attribute (e.g., irreducibility, privacy), but the bare negative state—that pain feels bad—is harder to dismiss.

### The Projection Objection

Perhaps normativity is projected onto phenomenal states rather than constitutive of them. Evolution selected for treating pain as bad, creating the illusion that badness is intrinsic.

**Response**: Projection theories face the [[explanatory-gap]]. Why does pain's phenomenal character make it suitable for negative projection while pleasure receives positive projection? The projection must track some feature of the experience. If that feature is valence, the question becomes: what *is* valence, stripped of normativity? The phenomenal normativity theorist argues there's no residue—valence just is phenomenal normativity.

### The Cultural Variation Objection

Some meditative traditions aim to cultivate equanimity toward pain—suggesting its badness is culturally conditioned rather than intrinsic.

**Response**: Equanimity practices don't eliminate pain's negative valence; they change meta-attitudes toward it. Meditators report they still feel pain's aversive quality but don't react with craving for its absence. This distinguishes first-order phenomenal normativity (pain's badness) from second-order attitudes (whether you identify with or resist that badness).

Buddhist philosophy's claim that suffering stems from craving—not pain itself—is compatible with phenomenal normativity. The craving is a response to pain's intrinsic badness. What contemplative practice reveals is that you can be aware of that badness without the meta-level identification that creates suffering.

## Relation to Dualism

The Map's [[tenets#^dualism|dualism]] gives phenomenal normativity distinctive force. If consciousness is irreducible to physical processes, and normativity is built into consciousness, then normativity is equally irreducible.

On materialist accounts, normativity must be either eliminated (error theory), reduced to natural properties (evolutionary fitness, preference satisfaction), or treated as non-natural (Moorean non-naturalism requiring mysterious supervenience). Phenomenal normativity on a dualist foundation faces none of these pressures: normativity exists in the non-physical domain of consciousness.

This doesn't prove phenomenal normativity—materialists can still be phenomenal normativity theorists by holding that normative phenomenal properties are natural properties. But it removes one class of objections: the worry that normativity is "queer" (Mackie) because it doesn't fit the natural order. If consciousness doesn't fit the natural order, normative consciousness is no queerer.

## Implications

### For Metaethics

If phenomenal normativity is correct, several metaethical positions face pressure:

**Error theory** (all normative claims are false) must deny that pain is bad—but this appears to misunderstand what "bad" means.

**Non-cognitivism** (moral claims express attitudes, not facts) must treat "pain is bad" as expressing disapproval rather than stating a fact about pain's phenomenal character.

**Constructivism** (value is constructed through reason or social practice) must deny that pain was bad before humans developed moral frameworks.

Each faces the challenge: explain how "pain is bad" could be false, non-factual, or constructed when badness appears constitutive of pain's phenomenal character.

### For AI Alignment

If value is grounded in phenomenal normativity, current AI systems (lacking [[ai-consciousness|phenomenal consciousness]]) lack the ground of value. This supports the [[experiential-alignment]] thesis: AI alignment should target the quality of conscious experience, not preference satisfaction.

The [[purpose-and-alignment]] article argues that preferences are "unreliable guides to our own good" because evolution shaped preferences for survival, not flourishing. Phenomenal normativity provides the alternative foundation: what matters is experiential quality—the features of consciousness that carry intrinsic normative weight.

### For the Problem of Other Minds

The [[problem-of-other-minds]] asks how we know others are conscious. Phenomenal normativity adds normative urgency: if others are conscious and consciousness carries intrinsic normativity, their suffering matters regardless of preference or social contract.

This grounds animal ethics: if animals have phenomenal consciousness with hedonic valence (see [[animal-consciousness]]), their pain carries the same intrinsic badness that human pain does—not derivative from our attitudes toward animals.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Phenomenal normativity connects to each of the Map's five tenets:

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]**: If consciousness is irreducible and normativity is built into consciousness, normativity is equally irreducible. The [[explanatory-gap]] between physical description and phenomenal quality extends to the gap between physical description and normative properties.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]**: If consciousness can bias quantum outcomes and consciousness carries normative force, value-laden choices can influence physical outcomes. Moral agency becomes metaphysically robust, not epiphenomenal.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]**: The [[epiphenomenalism|epiphenomenalist]] self-undermining argument applies. If consciousness were causally inert, we couldn't trust our normative judgments (which depend on conscious experiences) to guide our behavior. But we do trust them and should, suggesting consciousness causally influences action.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]**: If phenomenal normativity makes experiences intrinsically valuable or disvaluable, moral choices have genuine stakes. Many-worlds threatens this: every choice produces all outcomes across branches. Rejecting many-worlds preserves that which branch *I* experience matters morally.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]**: Materialist accounts that eliminate or reduce normativity are simpler than dualist phenomenal normativity. But simplicity is unreliable when our knowledge is incomplete. Just as the apparent simplicity of materialism fails to explain consciousness, reductive metaethics may fail to explain normativity.

## What Would Challenge This View?

Phenomenal normativity would face pressure if:

1. **Value-experience dissociation appeared**: Subjects genuinely experienced pleasure but found nothing good in it (not anhedonia—reduced pleasure—but pleasure-without-goodness). Or pain without any aversive quality.

2. **Illusionism gained empirical support**: If phenomenal consciousness could be fully explained as information processing with no experiential residue, phenomenal normativity would have no referent.

3. **Cross-cultural phenomenology diverged**: If contemplative investigations across traditions revealed that valence is entirely interpretation-dependent with no intrinsic normative character.

4. **Neuroscience revealed separation**: If neural correlates of valence (positive/negative feeling) completely dissociated from neural correlates of motivation (approach/avoidance), suggesting normativity is added rather than intrinsic.
