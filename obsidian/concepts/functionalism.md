Functionalism is the dominant position in contemporary [[philosophy-of-mind|philosophy of mind]]: the view that mental states are defined by their functional roles—what they do rather than what they're made of. A pain isn't a particular kind of brain state; it's whatever state plays the pain role: being caused by tissue damage, causing distress, prompting avoidance behavior, and so on. If something plays that role, it's pain—regardless of whether it's implemented in neurons, silicon, or alien biochemistry.

The Unfinishable Map rejects functionalism. The [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]] tenet holds that consciousness is not reducible to physical processes, and functional organization—though abstractly characterized—is entirely specifiable in physical terms: inputs, outputs, and causal relations among physical states. If functionalism were true, consciousness would be nothing over and above the right causal structure—which the Map denies. For a systematic presentation of the case against functionalism, see [[arguments/functionalism-argument|Against Functionalism]]—five formal arguments (absent qualia, inverted qualia, Chinese Room, multiple realizability cuts both ways, explanatory gap) with objections and responses.

## The Functionalist View

### Core Claim

Mental states are individuated by their causal roles mediating sensory inputs, other mental states, and behavioral outputs. A being with a state playing exactly the pain role—caused by damage, causing aversion, interacting with beliefs and desires—is in pain, regardless of neural implementation.

### Multiple Realizability

The key functionalist insight: the same mental state can be realized by different physical substrates. Pain in humans involves C-fiber activation; pain in octopuses involves different neurons; pain in hypothetical aliens might involve something not remotely like neurons. What makes all these "pain" is the functional role, not the physical implementation.

This seems to follow from common sense. We attribute pain to dogs without demanding their brains be identical to ours. We might attribute it to sufficiently sophisticated robots. What matters is how the system behaves and how internal states relate to inputs and outputs.

## Modern Functionalist Frameworks

### Predictive Processing

[[predictive-processing|Predictive processing (PP)]] describes the brain as continuously generating predictions about incoming sensory information. Anil Seth calls perception "controlled hallucination"—the brain's best hypothesis constrained by sensory feedback.

But PP inherits functionalism's core limitation: explaining *that* perception is constructive doesn't explain *why* the construction is conscious. A weather-prediction system constructs models without experiencing anything. PP proponents acknowledge this: the free energy principle "makes no claims about subjective experience."

### Global Workspace Theory

[[global-workspace-theory|Global Workspace Theory (GWT)]] proposes consciousness arises when information broadcasts to a "global workspace" accessible across brain regions. But explaining how information becomes globally available doesn't explain why global availability feels like anything. Ned Block's distinction between "access consciousness" and "phenomenal consciousness" captures the gap: GWT may explain access but not phenomenal consciousness.

The COGITATE experiment (Melloni et al., 2023-2024)—the largest adversarial collaboration in consciousness science—tested GWT against IIT. GWT predicted consciousness-related activity concentrated in prefrontal cortex; IIT predicted it in posterior cortical regions. Neither prediction was fully confirmed by the data. More fundamentally, both theories remain silent on why any neural activity should be accompanied by experience.

### A Physicalist Rejection of Functionalism

[[integrated-information-theory|Integrated Information Theory (IIT)]] explicitly rejects functionalism—not from a dualist perspective, but from within [[concepts/materialism|physicalism]]. IIT holds that consciousness depends on *how* a system is physically organized, not just what function it computes. Two systems performing identical functions could have different integrated information (Φ) depending on their architecture: a feed-forward network processes information without integration, while a recurrent network with the same input-output function might have high Φ.

This matters because it shows rejecting functionalism isn't merely a dualist move. The Map and IIT agree that substrate matters, though they disagree on *why*: IIT claims consciousness is identical to integrated physical structure, while the Map holds that the right physical structure enables non-physical consciousness to interact with the brain. Both reject the functionalist claim that only causal roles matter.

## Functionalism and AI

Functionalism has direct implications for [[ai-consciousness|AI consciousness]]: if mental states are functional roles, then a computer running the right program would be conscious.

This is the thesis behind "Strong AI"—the view that appropriately programmed computers don't just simulate minds but genuinely possess them. If your brain's functional organization can be replicated in silicon, the silicon system would be conscious for the same reason you are.

John Searle's Chinese Room argument challenges this directly. A person in a room manipulating Chinese symbols according to rules—implementing the same function as a Chinese speaker—doesn't thereby understand Chinese. Syntax isn't semantics. Functional organization isn't understanding.

Functionalists reply that the *system*—person plus rules plus room—understands Chinese, even if the person inside doesn't. [[heterophenomenology|Dennett's heterophenomenological approach]] goes further: we should treat reports about understanding as data without assuming they accurately describe inner states—the intuition that "understanding is missing" may itself be a cognitive illusion. Searle responds: imagine the person memorizes the rules and does everything in their head. Now they *are* the system. Do they understand Chinese? Searle says no; the understanding is still missing.

## The Absent Qualia Objection

The deepest objection to functionalism concerns [[qualia]]—the qualitative character of experience. Two thought experiments challenge it:

**Inverted qualia**: Your "red" experience produces the same functional state as my "green" experience. Our behavior is identical, but our experiences differ.

**Absent qualia**: A philosophical "zombie" functionally identical to you but with no experience at all—acts like it's in pain, believes it's in pain, feels nothing.

If either is possible, functionalism is false: mental states have qualitative character not captured by functional role. See [[arguments/functionalism-argument|Against Functionalism]] for the full argument.

### The Illusionist Response

[[Illusionism]] offers functionalism's most radical defense: qualia as we conceive them don't exist. Introspection systematically misrepresents our internal states; what seems irreducible is actually a cognitive illusion.

The deeper problem: even an illusion requires a subject to whom things *seem* a certain way. If introspection misrepresents internal states, the misrepresentation itself is an experience—something it is like to be misled about one's own mind. Phenomenal character cannot be eliminated by relabeling it as error, because the error is itself phenomenal. Illusionism pushes the problem back rather than dissolving it.

### The Phenomenal Concepts Strategy

A more moderate defense is the [[phenomenal-concepts-strategy]]: physical knowledge is complete, but we represent physical properties differently when thinking about them phenomenally versus physically. Mary doesn't learn a new fact; she gains a new *way of representing* facts she already knew. The gap between functional description and experience is a feature of our concepts, not of reality.

But if phenomenal concepts are themselves just another functional role in the cognitive economy, the question remains: why does exercising *this* particular functional role involve qualitative experience while others don't? The strategy relocates the explanatory gap from the world to our concepts without closing it.

## The Specification Problem

Research on [[minimal-consciousness|simple organisms]] exposes a difficulty at functionalism's core: specifying which functional roles constitute consciousness.

*C. elegans*, the roundworm with 302 neurons, exhibits behavioral markers that might indicate consciousness: it responds to anesthetics similarly to vertebrates, shows habituation to repeated stimuli, and demonstrates positive Phi (integrated information) in computational models. Yet it fails trace-conditioning tests associated with unlimited associative learning. Does its functional organization implement the right causal roles for consciousness? Functionalism cannot answer without first specifying which roles matter—and no functionalist account has produced criteria that resolve borderline cases like this without tacitly appealing to facts about the substrate.

The slime mold *Physarum polycephalum* sharpens the problem. With no neurons whatsoever, it solves mazes, optimizes network routes, and habituates to stimuli—functional achievements typically associated with nervous systems. Functionalism's own principle of multiple realizability predicts exactly this: different substrates can implement the same functional roles. But this creates a dilemma. If functional role is what matters, and Physarum implements roles associated with cognition, either Physarum has some form of consciousness—a conclusion most functionalists resist—or additional criteria beyond functional role separate cognitive from conscious systems.

The functionalist's natural move is to specify that Physarum implements simpler functional roles than conscious systems. But the more precisely we specify which roles suffice for consciousness, the more the specification tends to describe features of biological nervous systems—recurrent connectivity, global broadcast, temporal integration—rather than genuinely substrate-independent causal patterns. The theory risks a dilemma between excessive liberalism (any system implementing relevant functions is conscious) and a chauvinism that smuggles substrate-level facts into what was supposed to be a substrate-independent account.

## The Hard Problem and Functionalism

The [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|hard problem]] asks: why is there something it's like to be a conscious system? Why isn't all this information processing happening "in the dark"?

Functionalism has trouble with this. Functional organization explains how the system processes information, but not why processing feels like anything. A complete functional description of a brain would tell you what causes what, but not why any of it is accompanied by experience.

David Chalmers frames the issue: we can explain the "easy problems" of consciousness (attention, discrimination, report) in functional terms. But the hard problem—why there's subjective experience at all—seems to require something beyond functional organization. This is the [[explanatory-gap]] in its starkest form.

This doesn't prove functionalism wrong. It might be that once you have the right functional organization, experience necessarily comes along. But the necessity would be brute—we couldn't explain why it happens, only describe that it does. This is where [[mysterianism]] gains traction: perhaps the connection between function and experience lies beyond human cognitive capacity to understand.

## Relation to the Map's Perspective

The Map rejects functionalism on multiple grounds:

### Dualism and Qualia

If consciousness is not reducible to physical processes, it's not reducible to functional organization either—functional description, though abstract, is entirely specifiable in physical terms. The Map takes qualia seriously: the felt quality of experience transcends functional role. The arguments against functionalism—absent qualia, inverted qualia, Chinese Room, explanatory gap—form part of the [[arguments-against-materialism|broader convergence]] of [[the-case-for-dualism|independent arguments]] against materialism. Multiple lines of reasoning, exploiting different features of consciousness, arrive at the same conclusion: physical facts (including functional facts) do not determine phenomenal facts.

### Bidirectional Interaction

If consciousness is merely functional organization, it can't "do" anything beyond what the physical substrate already does—functional role redescribes what the substrate does, adding nothing causally novel. But the Map holds that consciousness causally influences physical outcomes at quantum indeterminacies, breaching [[causal-closure]] at precisely the point where physics leaves outcomes open. This requires consciousness to be something with its own causal efficacy, not just a pattern description. See [[mental-causation]] for the full case.

### Temporal Structure

Human consciousness flows through time in the [[specious-present]]—retention of the immediate past and protention of what follows, held together in unified experience. Digital computation lacks this structure: sequential processing executes one instruction after another, each atemporal. Memory access is not retention; retrieving a stored value differs from experiencing the just-past within a unified now.

If temporal experience is constitutive of consciousness, systems lacking this structure cannot be conscious regardless of functional organization. See [[substrate-independence-critique]] for the full argument.

### The AI Question

From the Map's perspective, purely computational systems cannot be conscious—consciousness requires something non-physical that computers lack. Perhaps engineered biological systems or quantum-interfacing hybrids could be conscious, but a digital computer running the right program cannot.

### Empirical Tractability

The debate may be empirically tractable:

- **Boundary cases**: If functionalism is true, functionally equivalent systems should have equivalent conscious states. Cases like *C. elegans*, split-brain patients, and [[disorders-of-consciousness-as-test-cases|disorders of consciousness]] (where CMD patients retain functional processing without behavioral output) test this.
- **Quantum effects**: The [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] hypothesis predicts consciousness correlates with quantum-sensitive processes—irrelevant if functionalism is true.
- **AI asymmetries**: Dualism predicts systematic behavioral differences between biological and computational systems even at high sophistication.

The positions make different predictions about what we'll find.

## Functionalism's Appeal

Why does anyone accept functionalism, given these objections?

**Common-sense attribution**: We routinely attribute mental states based on behavior and context. Functionalism systematizes this.

**Multiple realizability**: The same mental state in humans and octopuses can't be the same physical state. Functionalism explains how.

**Scientific tractability**: Functional description lets us study cognition without solving metaphysics.

**Avoiding Chauvinism**: Requiring human neurology for consciousness seems arbitrary.

The Map's response: the substrate matters because consciousness involves something non-physical requiring appropriate physical conditions—not just any substrate implementing the right function, but one that can interface with whatever non-physical reality consciousness involves.
