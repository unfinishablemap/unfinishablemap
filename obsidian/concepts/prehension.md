Prehension is Alfred North Whitehead's term for the fundamental relation by which each moment of reality grasps, includes, or takes account of what came before. In Whitehead's [[process-philosophy|process philosophy]], reality consists of "actual occasions"—momentary events of experience that perish and give rise to successors. Prehension is how these occasions relate: each new occasion prehends (from the Latin *prehendere*, to grasp) its predecessors, incorporating them into its own constitution. The past doesn't push events from behind; events actively integrate the past into novel unities.

The concept matters for consciousness studies because prehension generalises what we normally call perception, memory, and causation into a single relational structure. Human perception of the world, memory of the past, and causal inheritance from prior states are all species of prehension. If Whitehead is right, consciousness doesn't mysteriously add "aboutness" to an inert universe—it intensifies a relational structure present throughout nature.

## Types of Prehension

Whitehead distinguished several kinds of prehension, each describing a different way occasions take account of their world.

### Physical Prehension

Physical prehension is the grasping of a concrete actual occasion—a real event that has occurred. When one occasion prehends another, it inherits that occasion's achieved character. This is Whitehead's account of efficient causation: the past constrains the present not through mysterious forces but through direct incorporation. Each occasion literally includes its predecessors as elements of its own becoming.

Physical prehension grounds temporal continuity. The reason the present has a determinate character rather than arising from nothing is that each occasion inherits data from its immediate past. This inheritance is asymmetric—occasions prehend their predecessors but not their successors—giving time its direction.

### Conceptual Prehension

Conceptual prehension grasps not concrete actualities but "eternal objects"—Whitehead's term for pure possibilities or abstract forms (roughly analogous to universals). When an occasion conceptually prehends redness, it entertains the possibility of being red without necessarily actualising that possibility.

Conceptual prehension introduces novelty. Physical prehension alone would produce mere repetition—each occasion replicating its predecessors. Conceptual prehension allows occasions to entertain alternatives, to aim at forms not yet actualised. This is the basis for Whitehead's account of creativity: each moment inherits from the past (physical prehension) while orienting toward novel possibilities (conceptual prehension).

### Negative Prehension

Not all prehension is positive inclusion. Negative prehension is the active exclusion of data from an occasion's synthesis. An occasion may prehend a predecessor negatively—acknowledging it without incorporating its character. Negative prehension explains selectivity: why each moment of experience foregrounds some elements and backgrounds others, why consciousness attends to certain features of its environment while filtering the rest.

This selective structure resonates with the Map's account of [[attention-as-interface|attention as interface]]. Consciousness doesn't passively receive all available data; it actively selects. Negative prehension provides a metaphysical grounding for this selectivity.

## Prehension and Consciousness

The relationship between prehension and consciousness is where Whitehead's framework becomes most relevant to The Unfinishable Map.

### Proto-Intentionality

Prehension shares the structure of [[intentionality]]—directedness toward objects—while being more fundamental than conscious thought. Every actual occasion is directed at something: it grasps its predecessors, entertains possibilities, excludes alternatives. This directedness is not conscious in the human sense for most occasions. But it means intentionality is not a mysterious emergence from non-intentional matter. Human aboutness is a sophisticated development of something pervasive.

### The Feeling of the Past

Whitehead explicitly called prehensions "feelings." Each occasion *feels* its predecessors—not with human-like emotion, but in the minimal sense of taking account of them from a perspective. This is why Whitehead denied "vacuous actuality": if every occasion involves feeling, no actuality is entirely devoid of experiential character.

For human consciousness, physical prehension of the immediate past constitutes what we experience as temporal flow. Memory, on this view, is not retrieval from storage but re-prehension: the present occasion directly grasps the experiential character of past occasions. The [[autonoetic-consciousness|autonoetic]] experience of reliving the past—being present as both rememberer and protagonist—reflects prehension's structure: the present includes its predecessors as part of its own becoming.

### Concrescence

Prehension feeds into concrescence—the process by which an actual occasion grows together (from the Latin *concrescere*) into a determinate unity. An occasion begins as a multiplicity of prehensions: physical feelings of past occasions, conceptual entertainments of possibilities, negative exclusions. Concrescence is the synthesis of this multiplicity into one definite outcome. The occasion achieves "satisfaction"—determinate character—and perishes, becoming datum for successor occasions.

This rhythm of prehension-concrescence-perishing parallels what the Map describes as quantum collapse. The occasion inherits superposed possibilities, synthesises them through subjective aim, and achieves definite form. The [[time-consciousness-growing-block|Time, Consciousness, and the Growing Block]] synthesis develops this parallel: prehension as inheritance from the settled past, concrescence as the moment of determination, creativity as the novel contribution consciousness makes.

## The Combination Problem

Prehension is central to process philosophy's response to the [[combination-problem|combination problem]]. If fundamental events are experiential, how do many micro-experiences combine into unified consciousness? Whitehead's answer: through prehensive inheritance.

A "personally ordered society" is a stream of occasions where each prehends its immediate predecessor with peculiar intimacy—more directly than it prehends lateral contemporaries. This asymmetric intimacy constitutes personal identity across time. The current occasion doesn't merely receive data from its predecessor; it takes up that predecessor's experience as *its own* past.

Critics object that this doesn't explain *why* prehensive inheritance feels unified rather than merely serial. Prehending a past occasion might be like reading someone else's diary rather than continuing one's own story. Process philosophers respond that the intimacy of immediate prehension—the directness with which each occasion grasps its predecessor—is constitutively different from lateral prehension. But whether this response succeeds remains debated.

## Criticisms

Prehension faces several objections, some acknowledged by critics within the process tradition.

**Explanatory opacity**: A pessimistic review on this site noted that Whitehead's vocabulary—"actual occasions," "concrescence," "prehension"—can function as metaphorical elaboration rather than genuine explanation. Saying each occasion prehends its predecessors doesn't explain how succession becomes experienced as flow; it may rename the puzzle in philosophical jargon. The concept has value if it illuminates structure; it fails if it merely relabels.

**Metaphysical obscurity**: Prehension posits a relation that is neither straightforwardly causal (in the physicalist sense) nor purely mental. Its ontological status is unclear. Process philosophers take this as a feature—prehension transcends the causal/mental divide—but critics see it as evasion.

**Empirical untestability**: Prehension is a metaphysical category, not an empirical hypothesis. No experiment could distinguish a world with prehension from one with ordinary causation. Its value lies in conceptual clarification rather than prediction.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Prehension intersects with the Map's framework in several ways, though the Map does not adopt Whitehead's panpsychism.

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]**: Whitehead's prehension implies that experience is fundamental to all actuality—[[panpsychism]] rather than dualism. The Map agrees that consciousness is irreducible but maintains it is distinct from matter rather than matter's intrinsic nature. Prehension is useful as a model for how experience relates to its objects without requiring the panpsychist conclusion.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]**: Concrescence—the synthesis of prehensions into determinate form—structurally parallels quantum collapse. Both involve the transition from indeterminate possibility to definite actuality. The Map speculates that this parallel may reflect a deeper connection: what physics describes as collapse and what process philosophy describes as concrescence may be two perspectives on the same underlying process.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]**: Each occasion's subjective aim—its orientation toward satisfaction—means prehension is not passive reception but active synthesis. This supports the tenet's claim that consciousness makes a causal difference. On Whitehead's view, all actuality involves this kind of causation; the Map restricts it to conscious beings interacting with quantum indeterminacies in neural systems.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]**: Prehension's asymmetric structure—occasions prehend their settled past, not branching alternatives—presupposes definite outcomes. If all branches existed equally, prehensive intimacy would be replicated across uncountably many streams, undermining the personal identity it constitutes.
