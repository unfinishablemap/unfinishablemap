Indexical facts are facts that can only be stated using indexical expressions—words like "I," "here," "now," "this," and "that" whose reference depends on the context of use. The fact that *I* am this person, that *this* is happening *now*, that the pain is *here*—these resist translation into impersonal, context-free language. Indexical facts pose deep challenges for physicalism and feature centrally in arguments about consciousness, personal identity, and the [[vertiginous-question|vertiginous question]].

## What Makes a Fact Indexical

Consider the difference between:
- "Andy is in London on January 27, 2026"
- "I am here now"

The first statement can be understood by anyone, regardless of who they are or where they stand. It specifies a person, place, and time using names and dates that don't depend on context. The second statement has no fixed meaning until you know who uttered it, where, and when. The same words spoken by different people in different places mean different things.

Indexical facts are those that cannot be fully captured without indexicals. John Perry's influential example: you're in a supermarket and see sugar trailing on the floor. You follow the trail, trying to find the person making the mess—only to realise *you* are that person. You knew that "someone with a torn sugar bag is making a mess" but didn't know that *I* am making a mess. The indexical fact adds something the impersonal description lacks.

David Lewis's "Two Gods" scenario sharpens the point: imagine two omniscient gods who know every impersonal fact about the universe—every particle's position, every event's timing, every causal relation. Yet each god might not know *which* god they are. Self-locating knowledge ("I am the god in the mountain, not the one in the sea") is distinct from impersonal knowledge. Even omniscience about third-person facts leaves first-person facts undetermined.

## The Problem for Physicalism

If physics aims to describe reality in context-independent terms—particle positions, field strengths, causal laws—then indexical facts pose a problem. Physics tells you what exists and how things relate, but not *which* of those things you are or *where* you stand in the causal network.

Consider: a complete physical description of the universe would specify every brain, every neural pattern, every conscious experience (if consciousness is physical). But would it tell you which brain is yours? The description treats all brains equally—no brain is privileged as "the one I am." The indexical fact "this brain is mine" seems to add something the physical description lacks.

This connects to [[qualia]] and [[phenomenal-consciousness]]. The hard problem asks why physical processes give rise to subjective experience at all. Indexical facts add another layer: even granting that experiences exist, there's a further question about why *this* experience is the one I'm having. The redness of red is puzzling enough; that *I* am experiencing *this* redness adds indexical puzzlement on top.

Christian List argues that irreducible indexical facts provide evidence against "third-personal metaphysics"—any picture claiming reality is fully describable without indexicals. If "I am this person" is a genuine fact not derivable from impersonal facts, then reality includes more than physics captures.

## Indexical Facts and Personal Identity

The question "what makes me the same person over time?" is traditionally about criteria of identity—psychological continuity, physical continuity, or some combination. But indexical facts raise a prior question: what makes me *this* person right now?

Pattern-identity theories (like those following Parfit) hold that personal identity consists in patterns of psychological continuity—memories, personality traits, beliefs. But indexical facts resist pattern reduction. Two people could hypothetically share all psychological patterns (through perfect copying), yet there would be a fact about which one is me. The indexical "I" picks out something that patterns alone don't determine.

This connects to [[haecceity]]—primitive "thisness" that individuates particulars beyond their qualitative features. Robert Adams argued that "primitive thisness" cannot be reduced to general properties. Applied to persons: the fact that I am *this* individual is basic, not derivable from what properties I have or what patterns I instantiate.

The [[vertiginous-question]] makes this vivid: why, of all conscious beings, am I *this* one? The question asks about an indexical fact—the fact that *I* am here, experiencing from this perspective. No amount of third-person information seems to answer it.

## Essential Indexicals

Perry's work on "the essential indexical" established that some beliefs and actions cannot be explained without indexical reference. Knowing that "the meeting starts at noon" is not the same as knowing that "the meeting starts now"—only the latter motivates you to stop what you're doing and attend.

This extends to self-reference. You might know every fact about Andy—his location, his neural states, his actions—without knowing that *you* are Andy. The indexical belief "I am Andy" is not equivalent to any set of beliefs about Andy stated in the third person. It's a different kind of belief, with different motivational and cognitive roles.

For consciousness, this suggests that first-person access to experience differs fundamentally from third-person knowledge about experience. A neuroscientist might know everything about your brain states while you know something they cannot: what it is like to be in those states. This "what it is like" involves indexical facts—facts about *this* experience as experienced from the inside.

## Temporal and Spatial Indexicality

"Now" and "here" are indexical just as "I" is. The fact that this moment is *now* cannot be stated without indexicals—every moment is equally present from its own perspective. Similarly, "here" picks out a location relative to the speaker.

Some philosophers argue temporal indexicality is less problematic: "now" simply means "simultaneous with this utterance," reducible to objective time plus context. But this reduction may not work for consciousness. Your experience is always *now*—the present moment has a phenomenal quality that past and future lack. This "nowness" may be an indexical fact that resists reduction to objective temporal relations.

Spatial indexicality connects to embodiment. Your body is *here*—not merely at some objectively specified location, but at the centre of your experiential field. Phenomenologists emphasise that space is lived from a perspective, not just mapped objectively. The indexical "here" captures something about spatial experience that coordinates cannot.

## Implications for the Many-Worlds Interpretation

The [[many-worlds]] interpretation holds that every quantum measurement causes branching—all outcomes occur in parallel branches, each equally real. This creates a problem for indexical facts.

Before measurement, there's one observer. After measurement, there are multiple observers in different branches. Which one is "really" you? Many-worlds provides no answer—all branches are equally real, all successors are equally continuous with your pre-measurement self. But you will experience one definite outcome, not all of them. The indexical fact "I am in this branch" seems meaningful, yet MWI gives it no grounding.

Everettians sometimes appeal to "self-locating uncertainty"—before observing the result, you're uncertain which branch you're in. But critics (including Friederich and Dawid) argue this fails: either the uncertainty is spurious (all outcomes occur, so there's no fact to be uncertain about) or it presupposes what it's meant to explain (why you'd expect one outcome rather than all).

The Map's [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]] tenet rejects MWI partly for this reason: indexical facts about which outcome you experience cannot be accommodated if all outcomes occur equally. Consciousness tracking one definite trajectory suggests genuine selection, not branching into all possibilities.

## Self-Locating Beliefs

Epistemologists distinguish:
- **Ordinary beliefs**: beliefs about what the world is like (impersonal facts)
- **Self-locating beliefs**: beliefs about where/who you are in the world (indexical facts)

Lewis's sleeping beauty problem, Elga's probability puzzles, and various thought experiments show that self-locating beliefs have distinctive features. You can know all impersonal facts yet be uncertain about self-locating ones.

For consciousness, this suggests first-person knowledge is irreducibly different from third-person knowledge. Even knowing all physical and functional facts about brains, you might not know which brain you are "in." The indexical fact of being this particular subject adds something third-person facts don't provide.

This doesn't require dualism by itself, but it shows that any adequate metaphysics must make room for indexical facts—facts that are real, but not statable without indexicals.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Indexical facts connect to The Unfinishable Map's [[tenets]] in several ways.

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]**: If consciousness involves irreducibly indexical facts—if "I am this experiencer" cannot be derived from impersonal physical facts—then physical description is incomplete. The dualist position makes room for indexical facts as genuinely ontological, not merely linguistic. Consciousness is not just qualitative experience ([[qualia]]) but *this* subject having *this* experience. The first-person perspective is part of what makes consciousness irreducible.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]**: Indexical facts require that there be facts about which branch, which outcome, which experience is yours. Many-worlds denies such facts—all branches are equally real. The Map's rejection of MWI preserves the meaningfulness of indexical identity. You will experience one sequence of outcomes; that sequence is picked out by indexical facts that MWI cannot accommodate.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]**: You report your indexical facts—"I see red," "I am here," "this hurts." These reports are physical (speech, writing). If indexical facts had no causal power, how would they influence the physical processes that produce reports? The ability to communicate indexical facts suggests they're not epiphenomenal but causally efficacious.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]**: Anti-indexicalism appeals to parsimony—why posit irreducible indexical facts when impersonal descriptions might suffice? But the Lewis "Two Gods" scenario and the vertiginous question show impersonal facts don't capture everything real. Parsimony that eliminates genuine phenomena is not intellectual virtue but blindness.
