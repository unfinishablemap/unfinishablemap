The conceivability-possibility inference is the principle that if something can be coherently conceived, it is at least metaphysically possible. This seemingly innocent bridge from imagination to reality powers some of philosophy's most contested arguments—particularly in philosophy of mind, where [[philosophical-zombies|zombie arguments]] and the [[knowledge-argument|knowledge argument]] depend on inferring genuine metaphysical possibilities from acts of conceiving.

The Unfinishable Map endorses this inference in its strongest form—ideal positive conceivability of fundamental conceptual separations—as evidentially significant for dualism. When sustained reflection reveals that consciousness can be coherently separated from physical structure, this gap is not a trick of imagination but genuine evidence about reality's structure.

The inference matters because conceivability is epistemically accessible—we can investigate what we can and cannot imagine—while metaphysical possibility concerns the structure of reality itself, which may be hidden from direct inspection. If conceivability reliably tracks possibility, we gain an investigative tool. If it doesn't, major arguments collapse.

## The Basic Inference

**Standard form:**
1. S can coherently conceive that P
2. If P is coherently conceivable, then P is metaphysically possible
3. Therefore, P is metaphysically possible

**Example application (zombie argument):**
1. I can coherently conceive of a being physically identical to me but lacking consciousness
2. If such a being is coherently conceivable, it is metaphysically possible
3. Therefore, [[philosophical-zombies]] are metaphysically possible
4. If zombies are possible, [[materialism|physicalism]] is false (consciousness is not entailed by physical facts)

The inference transforms a first-person imaginative act into a claim about the fundamental structure of reality.

## Chalmers' Refinement

David Chalmers has developed the most sophisticated defense of conceivability-possibility reasoning. His framework distinguishes types of conceivability and types of possibility, then specifies which pairings yield reliable inferences.

### Types of Conceivability

**Prima facie vs. ideal conceivability:**
- **Prima facie**: Seems conceivable on initial reflection, but might contain hidden contradictions
- **Ideal**: Survives idealized rational reflection—no contradiction emerges even under maximal scrutiny

**Positive vs. negative conceivability:**
- **Positive**: Can form a detailed imagined situation where P holds
- **Negative**: Cannot detect any contradiction in P even after careful analysis

Prima facie conceivability is unreliable—many mathematical falsehoods seem conceivable until proven impossible. Chalmers argues that *ideal positive conceivability* provides the strongest epistemic warrant for possibility claims.

### The Core Claim

Chalmers defends: **Ideal positive conceivability entails primary possibility**.

"Primary possibility" concerns whether a scenario is ruled out by the fundamental nature of properties themselves, not merely by how those properties happen to be instantiated in our world. Water being H₂O is not primarily necessary—we can conceive of "water" (the clear liquid that falls as rain) being a different chemical compound. But water being conscious might be primarily impossible if consciousness has an essential nature incompatible with purely physical structure.

The zombie argument exploits this: if we can ideally positively conceive of physical duplicates lacking consciousness, then consciousness is not necessitated by physical structure itself—it's a further fact about reality.

## Challenges to the Inference

### The Confabulation Objection

**Problem:** What feels like genuine conceiving might be pseudo-conceiving—manipulating labels without grasping genuine content.

When you "conceive" of a zombie, are you imagining a genuinely complete physical duplicate that lacks consciousness? Or are you just *telling yourself* you're imagining this while actually leaving crucial details unspecified?

The research on [[voids-conceptual-impossibility-2026-01-23|conceptual impossibility]] reveals an asymmetry: we can *refer to* impossibilities like "round square" without being able to *grasp* them. Could zombie conceivability be similar—linguistic reference without genuine conceptual content?

**Response:** Chalmers acknowledges this risk, which is why he requires *ideal positive* conceivability. Ideal reflection involves filling in details, checking for hidden contradictions, and ensuring the imagined scenario is coherent under sustained scrutiny. If gaps remain under ideal reflection, conceivability fails.

### The Two-Dimensional Objection

**Problem:** Conceivability might track epistemic possibility (compatible with what we know) rather than metaphysical possibility (compatible with reality's structure).

Before Kripke, philosophers thought "water is not H₂O" was conceivable. It seemed imaginable that water could be a different substance. But Kripke argued this was an illusion—what we conceived was a *watery stuff* that isn't H₂O, not *water itself* being non-H₂O. Water is necessarily H₂O; we just didn't know this initially.

Could zombie conceivability be similar? We *think* we're conceiving of physical duplicates lacking consciousness, but actually we're conceiving of *something else* (non-conscious functional duplicates that aren't genuine physical duplicates).

**Response:** Chalmers' two-dimensional semantics is designed to address this. He distinguishes primary intensions (how terms pick out referents given incomplete information) from secondary intensions (how terms pick out referents given the actual world). Zombie conceivability operates at the primary level—and if consciousness is not part of the primary intension of "physical," then physicalism fails.

This response is contested. Block and Stalnaker argue that two-dimensional semantics does not apply to phenomenal concepts the way Chalmers claims—that the primary intension of "consciousness" may itself be physically constituted, making the framework question-begging. The [[phenomenal-concepts-strategy]] represents physicalism's most sophisticated attempt to break the conceivability-possibility link specifically for phenomenal claims. Whether these responses succeed remains an active area of debate, though Chalmers' "master argument" (that any physicalist account of phenomenal concepts either relocates the [[explanatory-gap]] or fails to explain its persistence) poses a serious challenge to them.

### The Strength-Mismatch Objection

**Problem:** Even if conceivability provides *some* evidence for possibility, it might not be strong enough to bear the argumentative weight placed on it.

The history of science contains cases where expert conceivability proved misleading. For centuries, it seemed inconceivable that space could be non-Euclidean, that effects could precede causes at the quantum level, or that simultaneity could be relative. If sustained rational reflection has failed repeatedly for physical claims, why trust it for metaphysical ones?

**Response:** These cases require care. Some (non-Euclidean space, indeterministic physics) are scenarios that were initially *inconceivable* but turned out to be actual—conceivability failures that underestimated what is possible, not overestimated it. The zombie argument runs the other direction: it claims something *is* conceivable and therefore possible. The more relevant concern is cases where something seemed conceivable but proved impossible—and these are harder to find outside mathematics and logic.

More fundamentally, the physics cases concern empirical discoveries about contingent laws of nature, not conceptual necessities about whether one type of fact entails another. The conceivability-possibility inference is most reliable when dealing with constitutive relationships—whether physical facts *constitute* or *entail* phenomenal facts—rather than with which empirical laws happen to hold.

### The Cognitive Closure Objection

**Problem:** Perhaps our conceivability faculties are reliable in general but *locally unreliable* for the mind-body case specifically. If [[mysterianism|cognitive closure]] prevents us from grasping the properties that connect consciousness to physical structure, we might conceive of zombies not because they are genuinely possible but because we lack the concepts needed to see *why they are impossible*.

This is more targeted than general empiricist skepticism. It grants that conceivability-possibility reasoning works for mathematics, logic, and many metaphysical questions—but claims it fails precisely where consciousness meets physics, because that connection involves properties our cognitive architecture cannot represent.

**Response:** The cognitive closure objection faces a dilemma. If we cannot represent the relevant properties at all, then we also cannot determine whether zombie conceivability fails—the objection becomes unfalsifiable. And if the objection applies specifically to consciousness, one needs an explanation of *why* consciousness is the exception. The most natural explanation—that consciousness involves something beyond physical structure—is precisely what the dualist claims. Still, cognitive closure remains a genuinely open possibility, and the Map acknowledges it as such.

## Modal Rationalism and Its Limits

The conceivability-possibility inference embodies a form of *modal rationalism*—the view that reason can access modal truths (what is possible, necessary, or impossible) through a priori reflection.

**The rationalist bet:** Our imaginative faculties track something real about modal space. When we coherently conceive P, this isn't arbitrary—it reflects that P is compatible with the fundamental structure of reality.

**The empiricist skepticism:** Imagination is a cognitive capacity shaped by evolution and development. Why think it accurately maps metaphysical possibility rather than merely tracking what's familiar, useful, or psychologically accessible?

Modal rationalists point to successful cases (mathematical and logical necessity discovered through pure reason); empiricists point to failures (physical necessities that intuition missed). Neither side can resolve the dispute without presupposing something about the reliability of rational reflection.

However, consciousness conceivability may have special epistemic status. Unlike conceiving of non-Euclidean geometry or faster-than-light travel—where we lack direct access to the subject matter—we have first-person acquaintance with what consciousness *is*. When we conceive of a physical duplicate lacking consciousness, we are not manipulating abstract symbols but imagining the absence of something we know intimately through [[introspection]]. This gives zombie conceivability a different evidential weight from conceivability claims about domains we understand only theoretically. As the [[meta-problem-of-consciousness]] highlights, the very persistence and universality of the conceivability intuition is itself a datum requiring explanation.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The Unfinishable Map's [[tenets|first tenet]]—[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]—depends partly on conceivability arguments. The zombie argument (conceivability of physical duplicates lacking consciousness) and the knowledge argument (Mary gains new knowledge when experiencing color, showing phenomenal facts exceed physical facts) both employ conceivability-possibility reasoning.

If this inference is fundamentally unreliable, dualist arguments lose significant support. The Map's position thus requires at least *qualified* defense of the inference.

**The qualification:** The Map endorses the inference for *ideal positive conceivability* of fundamental conceptual separations, not for all conceivable scenarios. When we can coherently and completely imagine consciousness coming apart from physical structure, this reveals that consciousness is not conceptually entailed by physics—which is precisely what dualism claims.

The inference also supports the Map's [[tenets#^bidirectional|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet. If consciousness can be coherently conceived as separate from physical structure, this creates conceptual room for it to be causally efficacious rather than merely epiphenomenal—the conceivability of [[interactionist-dualism]] is a prerequisite for taking it seriously as a metaphysical option.

This aligns with the [[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]] tenet. The parsimony objection to dualism often assumes that conceivability arguments are mere "intuitions" to be overridden by simplicity. But if conceivability provides genuine epistemic access to modal structure, then the apparent simplicity of physicalism might reflect ignorance rather than insight—we fail to grasp the additional facts about consciousness because we're looking only at physical structure.

The Map's position is not that all conceivable scenarios are possible, but that when sustained, rigorous imaginative reflection reveals a conceptual gap—as between physical and phenomenal—this gap is evidentially significant. Dismissing it requires either showing the conceiving is pseudo-conceiving (contains hidden contradictions) or rejecting modal rationalism entirely (abandoning reason as a guide to possibility).

Both moves carry costs. The first requires demonstrating where zombie conceiving goes wrong—and decades of scrutiny haven't produced consensus that it does. The second abandons a priori modal reasoning altogether, making necessity and possibility empirically inaccessible—a radical skepticism that undermines much of philosophy and mathematics.
