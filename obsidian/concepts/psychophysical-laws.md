Psychophysical laws are fundamental principles connecting conscious experience to physical processes. If consciousness is ontologically distinct from physics—as The Unfinishable Map's [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism tenet]] holds—then no purely physical explanation can account for why particular brain states are accompanied by particular experiences. New laws are needed: laws relating phenomenal properties to physical properties at the most basic level. But specifying that such laws are needed is not enough. [[interactionist-dualism|Interactionist dualism]] faces a specification problem: *which* phenomenal properties map to *which* physical selections with enough precision to generate falsifiable predictions?

David Chalmers developed the most influential framework for psychophysical laws, arguing that consciousness requires extending our fundamental ontology. The Map builds on Chalmers while making different choices at key junctions—most critically, insisting on *downward* causation (phenomenal → physical selection) where Chalmers emphasizes *upward* laws (physical → phenomenal). This article covers both the framework (why psychophysical laws are needed and what structure they must have) and the coupling problem (what specific laws and mechanisms might look like). For an integrated overview, see [[psychophysical-laws-bridging-mind-and-matter]].

## Why Physics Alone Fails

The [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|hard problem]] shows that even a complete physical description of the brain leaves unexplained why there is something it is like to be that system. Phenomenal properties are not logically entailed by physical properties—experience resists functional reduction. If phenomenal properties are ontologically basic, their relationship to physics must be specified by new fundamental laws.

## Chalmers' Naturalistic Dualism

Chalmers calls his position "naturalistic dualism": dualist because mental properties are irreducible to physical properties, but naturalistic because mental states still relate lawfully to physical states. Psychophysical laws are as natural as physical laws—additional fundamental laws a complete theory requires, not Cartesian souls violating physics. This distinguishes his view from Cartesian substance dualism, strong [[emergence|emergentism]], and materialism.

## Supervenience Laws vs. Causal Laws

A crucial distinction: psychophysical laws can be *supervenience laws* or *causal laws*.

**Supervenience laws** specify which physical states are accompanied by which mental states—the laws run *upward* from physics to phenomenology. Chalmers primarily discusses these, and tends toward [[concepts/epiphenomenalism|epiphenomenalism]]: mental states are caused by physical states but don't cause physical states in return.

**Causal laws** (or "[[selection-laws|selection laws]]" in the Map's terminology) specify how mental states influence which physical states become actual. The Map's [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet requires causal laws—consciousness selects among physically underdetermined alternatives. Chalmers' framework primarily develops the upward direction; the Map needs both, with emphasis on the downward direction (phenomenal → physical selection).

## Chalmers' Three Principles

In "Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness" (1995), Chalmers proposes three psychophysical principles:

1. **Structural Coherence**: The structure of conscious experience corresponds to cognitive awareness structure. Limitation: inverted spectrum scenarios show structure alone doesn't determine phenomenal quality.

2. **Organizational Invariance**: Systems with identical functional organization have identical experiences. The Map rejects this—[[concepts/functionalism]] fails because the zombie argument shows functional organization doesn't logically entail experience. The [[haecceity]] of the particular conscious subject may matter beyond abstract patterns.

3. **Double-Aspect Theory of Information**: Information has both physical and phenomenal aspects, anticipating [[integrated-information-theory|IIT]]. The Map is skeptical of IIT's specific measures but the general information-experience connection remains relevant.

## The Quantum Development

Chalmers and McQueen (2022) develop quantum psychophysical laws combining IIT with collapse theory. Their key innovation—the *super-resistance principle*—holds that consciousness resists superposition: systems with high integrated information don't remain in superpositions of distinct conscious states.

They identify five constraints any dualist law must satisfy: (1) experiences must cause physical effects, (2) no observable violations of causal closure, (3) avoid overdetermination, (4) specify how physical states yield experiences, (5) functional duplication preserves phenomenology. The quantum framework addresses (1) and (2) elegantly: consciousness causes collapse without violating closure, since collapse is physically underdetermined.

## Where the Map Diverges

The Map builds on Chalmers' framework but makes different choices at key junctions:

**Direction of Causation**: The Map insists on downward causation (phenomenal → physical) where Chalmers tends toward epiphenomenalism. If consciousness were causally inert, our beliefs *about* consciousness would be causally disconnected from consciousness itself—self-undermining.

**The Selection Mechanism**: Where Chalmers leaves the mechanism abstract, the Map (following [[stapp-quantum-mind|Stapp]]) specifies attention as the mental variable and quantum Zeno maintenance as the mechanism—affecting which quantum possibilities become actual without injecting energy.

**Rejection of Organizational Invariance**: Substrate matters—not because silicon can't be conscious, but because particular physical instantiation may affect phenomenal character in ways functional description misses.

**Bandwidth Constraints**: The Map incorporates the ~10 bits/second limitation on conscious processing (Zheng & Meister 2025). Selection is coarse-grained—action patterns, not individual neurons—matching deliberate decision-making phenomenology at ~3-4 choices/second.

## The Coupling Problem

Without specifying *which* phenomenal properties map to *which* physical selections, "consciousness selects" remains a metaphor rather than a research program. A psychophysical coupling law would specify:

1. **Variables on the mental side**: What aspects of conscious experience map to selection? Attention? Intention? Valence? Effort?
2. **Variables on the physical side**: What quantum degrees of freedom are targetable? Individual outcomes? Probability weights? Basis choice?
3. **Bandwidth**: How much information can consciousness inject per unit time?
4. **Scope constraints**: What is *not* selectable?

What Schaffer calls the "t-shirt problem"—the lack of a compact systematization of psychophysical correlations—remains unsolved.

## Candidate Coupling Laws

Four families of coupling laws emerge, operating through different [[coupling-modes]]—basis control, timing control, or probability control:

### Law Family 1: Attention-Bounded Selection {#attention}

**Attention selects what it attends to.** Directed attention determines which neural representation becomes actual among quantum-superposed alternatives. Bandwidth: ~10 bits/second. Scope: only neural systems in the subject's attention loop. [[attention-consciousness-dissociation|Empirical evidence]] that attention and consciousness dissociate means coupling operates through *directed* attention specifically (the [[attention-as-interface|interface]] through which consciousness engages matter).

Stapp's quantum Zeno model provides the most developed mechanism: attending to a neural pattern increases observation rate, "freezing" the pattern via the Zeno effect. OCD patients using mindful attention showed measurable changes in caudate nucleus activation (Schwartz et al., 1996)—though this is compatible with physicalist neuroplasticity accounts. **Main objection**: Georgiev (2015) showed the Zeno effect breaks down for timescales exceeding brain decoherence time.

### Law Family 2: Policy-Level Selection {#intention}

**Consciousness selects among prepared action policies.** The brain generates options; consciousness chooses. This aligns with Libet's findings: readiness potential precedes conscious intention, but consciousness retains "veto power."

Eccles' psychon-dendron theory gives a specific mechanism: mental intention modulates quantum tunneling probability in neurotransmitter vesicle release. **Main objection**: the [[pairing-problem|pairing problem]]—how do immaterial psychons locate specific dendrons?

### Law Family 3: Basis-Choice Selection

**Consciousness chooses the question; physics provides the answer.** The minimal interpretation of Stapp's Process 1—consciousness shapes possibility space but doesn't determine specific outcomes.

### Law Family 4: Indexical Selection

**Consciousness selects which outcome is "this one."** Unlike MWI's self-locating uncertainty, selection makes one outcome *actual* and precludes the others—connecting to the Map's [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]] tenet.

### Comparative Overview

| Coupling | Phenomenal Property | Physical Selection | Development | Main Objection |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Attention→Observation** | Focus, effort | Measurement rate | High (challenged) | Decoherence timescale |
| **Intention→Probability** | Volition | Vesicle release | Medium | Pairing problem |
| **Valence→Motivation** | Pleasure/pain | Action selection | Low | No quantum mechanism |
| **Qualia→Basis** | Qualitative character | Measurement basis | Very low | Purely speculative |
| **Unity→Entanglement** | [[binding-problem|Phenomenal binding]] | Sustained coherence | Low | Correlation≠causation |

Stapp's attention mechanism provides the most developed account: clear phenomenal property (effort), clear physical parameter (observation rate), testable predictions, and experimental evidence (though contested). Valence, qualia, and unity couplings remain underspecified—no quantum-level mechanisms have been proposed for these.

## What's Not Selectable

A coupling law must specify exclusions—what consciousness cannot select:

- External quantum events (selection requires neural representation)
- Others' brains (attention scope is first-personal)
- Macroscopic objects (no quantum indeterminacy at relevant scale)
- Events outside attention scope
- Information beyond bandwidth limit (~10 bits/second)

Selection operates through attention, which is neurally implemented. The brain specialness problem resolves: selection is brain-local because attention is brain-local.

## The Decoherence Challenge

Any coupling law faces the [[decoherence]] objection: quantum superpositions in warm biological systems decay within femtoseconds—far too fast for neural processes on millisecond timescales. Three responses: (1) decoherence doesn't solve the measurement problem—even after decoherence, something must determine *which* outcome occurs, leaving a gap for consciousness to fill; (2) quantum biology shows some biological systems maintain coherence longer than thermal models predict, though most physicists accept Tegmark's calculations for neural-scale processes; (3) Stapp's Zeno mechanism operates through observation *frequency*, not coherence *duration*, so it doesn't require sustained coherence—though Georgiev's simulations challenge whether this works in biologically realistic conditions.

## The Illusionist Challenge

[[illusionism|Illusionists]] argue the need for psychophysical laws rests on a mistake—if phenomenal consciousness is an introspective illusion, no bridging laws are required. The illusionist position faces a regress: as [[introspection|Tallis observes]], "misrepresentation presupposes presentation"—the "illusion" of consciousness requires consciousness to be an illusion *for*, and that consciousness cannot be another illusion without infinite regress. The Map holds that we know phenomenal consciousness exists more certainly than we know any eliminativist argument is sound.

## Contemplative Evidence

[[mental-effort|Mental effort]]—the phenomenology of trying, attending, and directing—provides first-person evidence for downward causation. Effort feels like *doing* something to neural patterns, not like passively observing. Advanced meditators report that conscious experience continues even as cognitive processing dramatically reduces, suggesting the relationship is more bidirectional than Chalmers' supervenience-only framework implies. [[witness-consciousness|Witness consciousness]] provides further phenomenological support: the capacity to observe mental contents without identifying with them suggests consciousness is categorically different from its contents.

## Testing the Coupling Law

**Random number generator experiments** have attempted to detect consciousness influencing external quantum outcomes, with mixed results often attributed to publication bias. If the coupling law restricts selection to attention-controlled neural systems, RNG experiments should fail by design—the RNG is external.

**A better test**: Measure whether conscious effort correlates with neural pattern stability in attention networks. If Stapp's Zeno mechanism is real, effort should map to pattern persistence.

**Bandwidth measurement**: If selection is real, it should have measurable information-theoretic constraints that match conscious processing bandwidth.

## What Would Challenge This View?

The framework would face serious difficulty if: (1) the hard problem dissolves—if neuroscience explains our *belief* in consciousness without invoking phenomenal properties; (2) quantum mechanisms prove unavailable at neural scales, removing the Map's proposed pathway for downward causation; (3) organizational invariance is demonstrated through successful consciousness uploading, undermining the Map's rejection of functionalism; (4) many-worlds interpretation is confirmed, reducing selection laws to indexical uncertainty; (5) the ~10 bits/second bandwidth constraint proves incompatible with any quantum selection mechanism; or (6) RNG experiments consistently succeed, requiring revision of the attention-bounded scope restriction.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Psychophysical laws are where the Map's tenets become theoretically precise.

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]** requires psychophysical laws by definition. If consciousness is ontologically distinct from physics, something must specify how they relate. The coupling law presupposes mental and physical as distinct variables, lawfully related.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]** requires that these laws run in both directions—not just upward supervenience, but downward selection. This tenet most directly requires the coupling law: consciousness causally influences the physical world—but through what mechanism? Through attention, intention, or effort mapping to which quantum outcomes become actual.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]** constrains what kind of psychophysical laws are admissible. Consciousness biases quantum outcomes without violating conservation laws—the smallest intervention physics permits. The bandwidth constraint (~10 bits/second) further minimizes the channel.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]** means psychophysical laws govern genuine collapse, not indexical selection among equally real branches. Consciousness selects what becomes *actually* true, not which branch contains "this" observer. The selected outcome is *this* outcome, with [[haecceity|indexical identity]] that branching models cannot capture.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]** justifies the ontological expansion psychophysical laws require. A parsimonious theory that explains nothing is not genuinely simpler—it just ignores the explanandum. If consciousness exists and isn't physical, psychophysical laws are not optional additions but necessary completions of our picture of nature.

The Map cannot resolve which coupling law is correct—this is an open empirical and philosophical question. What the Map can do is articulate the problem clearly, specify what any adequate coupling law must accomplish, and evaluate existing proposals against those requirements.
