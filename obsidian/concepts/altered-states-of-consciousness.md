Altered states of consciousness (ASCs) constitute a diverse family of experiences—psychedelics, anesthesia, meditation, hypnosis, flow states, dreaming, near-death experiences—unified by qualitative deviation from baseline waking consciousness. For dualism, ASCs are particularly revealing: they demonstrate that consciousness operates in multiple modes with distinct phenomenal qualities, suggesting the brain-consciousness interface has configurable settings rather than being a simple on/off producer. The [[filter-theory|filter theory]] interprets each ASC as a different configuration of the filtering mechanism—some states *loosen* the filter (psychedelics, mystical experiences), others *narrow* it (anesthesia, sleep), still others *reconfigure* it (meditation, flow).

## Defining Altered States

Charles Tart's foundational definition (1969) identifies ASCs as "profound changes in the overall pattern of subjective experiences." This phenomenological approach avoids the question-begging implicit in some neuroscientific definitions that characterise ASCs as "increased tendency to produce misrepresentations." From the site's perspective, some ASCs may involve *less filtered* access to reality rather than error.

Key dimensions of alteration include:

| Dimension | Baseline State | Examples of Alteration |
|-----------|----------------|------------------------|
| Self-boundary | Stable sense of self | Ego dissolution (psychedelics), absorption (flow) |
| Time perception | Linear flow | Time dilation/contraction, eternity experiences |
| Agency | Normal volition | Automaticity (flow), reduced agency (hypnosis) |
| Perceptual vividness | Standard intensity | Enhancement (psychedelics) or dampening (sedation) |
| Access to memory | Selective retrieval | Expanded (some psychedelic states) or restricted |

## The Filter Theory Interpretation

The materialist interprets brain-consciousness correlations during ASCs as evidence of production: different brain states *generate* different conscious states. The filter theory offers an alternative: different brain states *configure* the interface differently, allowing different aspects of consciousness to manifest.

Several findings support the filter interpretation:

**Expansion rather than distortion.** Psychedelics don't merely scramble perception—they often *expand* it. Users report insights, enhanced pattern recognition, and access to normally unconscious material. Aldous Huxley's "reducing valve" metaphor captures this: the brain normally constrains consciousness to action-relevant information; psychedelics loosen this constraint.

**Identical outputs, divergent experiences.** Different anaesthetics (propofol vs. ketamine) can produce identical behavioural outputs—unresponsiveness, amnesia—while producing radically different conscious experiences. Ketamine preserves vivid experience despite behavioural unresponsiveness; propofol seems to eliminate experience entirely. If consciousness were simply produced by brain states, similar behavioural outputs should correlate with similar experiences.

**Information received but not perceived.** Neuroscience of anesthesia (2024) confirms that sensory information reaches the brain during light sedation but is not perceived. The signal arrives; something prevents its manifestation in consciousness. This is precisely what filter theory predicts—disruption of interface rather than disruption of consciousness itself.

## Specific States and What They Reveal

### Psychedelics

The REBUS model (Relaxed Beliefs Under Psychedelics) proposes that psychedelics relax high-level predictive constraints—the brain's expectations become less rigid, allowing bottom-up sensory information greater influence. The 2025 ALBUS extension (Altered Beliefs Under Psychedelics) connects this to predictive processing frameworks.

Neuroimaging reveals a paradox: psychedelics *decrease* within-network connectivity (especially in the [[neural-correlates-of-consciousness#The Default Mode Network|default mode network]]) while *increasing* between-network connectivity. The brain becomes simultaneously less integrated locally and more integrated globally.

The Penrose-Hameroff Orch OR theory proposes a quantum mechanism: psychedelic molecules bind to microtubules and induce quantum coherence. If consciousness participates in quantum collapse (as the [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet proposes), psychedelics might enhance this participation.

### Flow States

Csikszentmihalyi's flow—the state of optimal experience during skilled activity—involves "transient hypofrontality": reduced activity in executive control regions (superior frontal gyri) despite enhanced performance. This seems paradoxical: how does reduced control produce better outcomes?

Filter theory resolves the paradox. Flow involves consciousness *releasing* active control, allowing highly trained circuits to operate with less interference. The filter narrows to exclude deliberative processing while remaining open to automatic expertise. This supports [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]—consciousness normally exerts control, and its deliberate release in flow demonstrates its active role in non-flow cognition.

### Hypnosis

Recent neuroimaging (2025) confirms that hypnosis alters executive control network integration, corresponding to altered subjective sense of agency. Highly hypnotisable individuals show increased anterior default mode network activity. The key insight: altered sense of agency maps directly to altered neural patterns, but the direction of causation remains open. From the site's perspective, hypnotic suggestion may work by consciousness voluntarily reconfiguring its interface rather than brain states simply overriding consciousness.

### Meditation

Advanced meditation produces states ranging from focused absorption (samadhi) to [[witness-consciousness|witness awareness]] to cessation events—"radically altered states characterised by full loss of consciousness" that, unlike anaesthetic unconsciousness, are voluntary and transformative.

The voluntariness is crucial. Meditators deliberately alter their brain-consciousness interface through attention training. Longitudinal studies show meditation produces lasting structural brain changes. From the site's framework, this provides evidence for [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]: consciousness can deliberately reconfigure its neural interface through sustained practice.

### Near-Death Experiences

A 2024 University of Michigan study found gamma surges in dying patients—localised to the temporal-parietal-occipital junction associated with out-of-body experiences. Rivas et al. (2023) documented 120+ cases with veridical elements—accurate perceptions during apparent unconsciousness.

The empirical status remains contested. Sceptics note the lack of falsifiable predictions; advocates argue that some cases resist conventional explanation. What is clear: these experiences involve altered consciousness precisely when the brain's filtering function is maximally compromised—consistent with filter theory's prediction that reduced filtering allows expanded experience.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Altered states illuminate the site's [[tenets]] from multiple angles:

**Dualism:** ASCs demonstrate that consciousness has modes and configurations that cannot be straightforwardly mapped to brain states. The same behavioural output can mask different experiences; similar brain changes can produce opposite subjective effects.

**Minimal Quantum Interaction:** The Orch OR hypothesis proposes that psychedelics enhance quantum coherence in microtubules, providing a potential mechanism linking altered states to the quantum interface between mind and matter.

**Bidirectional Interaction:** Flow states and meditation demonstrate that consciousness can deliberately release control or reconfigure its interface—something impossible if consciousness were merely produced by, rather than interacting with, brain processes.

**No Many Worlds:** The site's rejection of many-worlds is consistent with ASC phenomenology: altered states feel like different modes of *this* consciousness, not glimpses into parallel selves.

The filter theory provides a unified framework: ASCs reveal different configurations of the brain-consciousness interface, not different productions by different brain states.
