Altered states of consciousness (ASCs) constitute a diverse family of experiences—psychedelics, anesthesia, meditation, hypnosis, flow states, dreaming, near-death experiences, and [[phenomenological-psychiatry-and-altered-experience|psychiatric conditions]] like depersonalization and schizophrenia—unified by [[qualia|qualitative]] deviation from baseline waking consciousness. For dualism, ASCs are particularly revealing: they demonstrate that consciousness operates in multiple modes with distinct phenomenal qualities, suggesting the brain-consciousness interface has configurable settings rather than being a simple on/off producer. The [[filter-theory|filter theory]] interprets each ASC as a different configuration of the filtering mechanism—some states *loosen* the filter (psychedelics, mystical experiences), others *narrow* it (anesthesia, sleep), still others *reconfigure* it (meditation, flow).

## Defining Altered States

Charles Tart's foundational definition (1969) identifies ASCs as "profound changes in the overall pattern of subjective experiences." This phenomenological approach avoids the question-begging implicit in some neuroscientific definitions that characterise ASCs as "increased tendency to produce misrepresentations." From The Unfinishable Map's perspective, some ASCs may involve *less filtered* access to reality rather than error. Whether such access genuinely transcends cognitive limits or merely maps their boundaries is explored in [[altered-states-as-void-probes]].

Tart's taxonomy identifies ten dimensions along which consciousness can vary: sense of identity, body image, time perception, perception, cognition, memory, affect, sense of meaning, volition, and unconscious processing. ASCs shift multiple dimensions simultaneously—distinguishing them from ordinary variations in mood or attention. The 2025 thalamic nuclei research identified five specific thalamic nuclei orchestrating state transitions, with distinct connectivity patterns across anesthesia, sleep, and disorders of consciousness—neuroimaging confirmation that ASCs represent discrete modes rather than continuous variation.

Key dimensions of alteration include:

| Dimension | Baseline State | Examples of Alteration |
|-----------|----------------|------------------------|
| Self-boundary | Stable sense of self | Ego dissolution (psychedelics), absorption (flow) |
| Time perception | Linear flow | Time dilation/contraction, eternity experiences |
| Agency | Normal volition | Automaticity (flow), reduced agency (hypnosis) |
| Perceptual vividness | Standard intensity | Enhancement (psychedelics) or dampening (sedation) |
| Access to memory | Selective retrieval | Expanded (some psychedelic states) or restricted |

## The Filter Theory Interpretation

The materialist interprets brain-consciousness correlations during ASCs as evidence of production: different brain states *generate* different conscious states. The filter theory offers an alternative: different brain states *configure* the interface differently, allowing different aspects of consciousness to manifest.

Several findings support the filter interpretation:

**Expansion rather than distortion.** Psychedelics don't merely scramble perception—they often *expand* it. Users report insights, enhanced pattern recognition, and access to normally unconscious material. Aldous Huxley's "reducing valve" metaphor captures this: the brain normally constrains consciousness to action-relevant information; psychedelics loosen this constraint.

A materialist objection holds that these "insights" are illusory—confabulations that merely *feel* profound without genuine epistemic value. A deeper version notes that psychedelics disrupt the very neural processes required for accurate introspection—how can we trust reports from compromised metacognitive systems? The response: some psychedelic insights prove verifiable (therapeutic breakthroughs, creative solutions), and the expansion hypothesis predicts their *selectivity*—not random confabulation but access to genuinely suppressed information (childhood memories, repressed patterns). Pure confabulation would be random; genuine filter-loosening would be informative. Clinical studies of psilocybin-assisted therapy show lasting improvements in depression and anxiety that correlate with reported mystical-type experiences, suggesting the insights have functional validity beyond subjective impression.

**Identical outputs, divergent experiences.** Different anaesthetics (propofol vs. ketamine) can produce identical behavioural outputs—unresponsiveness, amnesia—while producing radically different conscious experiences. Ketamine preserves vivid experience despite behavioural unresponsiveness; propofol seems to eliminate experience entirely. Mashour and Bharioke (2024) demonstrate this asymmetry through neuroimaging: both agents suppress cortical activity, but through different thalamic pathways with different phenomenal consequences. If consciousness were simply produced by brain states, similar behavioural suppression should correlate with similar phenomenal suppression. The divergence suggests the brain *mediates* rather than *generates* experience.

**Information received but not perceived.** Mashour and Bharioke's 2024 *Neuron* review confirms that sensory information reaches the brain during light sedation but is not perceived—what they term "received but not perceived." The signal arrives; something prevents its manifestation in consciousness. This is precisely what filter theory predicts—disruption of interface rather than disruption of consciousness itself.

## Specific States and What They Reveal

### Psychedelics

The REBUS model (Relaxed Beliefs Under Psychedelics) proposes that psychedelics relax high-level predictive constraints—the brain's expectations become less rigid, allowing bottom-up sensory information greater influence (Carhart-Harris & Friston, 2019).

Neuroimaging reveals a paradox: psychedelics *decrease* within-network connectivity (especially in the [[neural-correlates-of-consciousness#The Default Mode Network|default mode network]]) while *increasing* between-network connectivity. The brain becomes simultaneously less integrated locally and more integrated globally.

The Penrose-Hameroff Orch OR theory proposes a quantum mechanism: psychedelic molecules bind to microtubules and induce quantum coherence. If consciousness participates in quantum collapse (as the [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet proposes), psychedelics might enhance this participation. This hypothesis remains speculative—quantum coherence in warm biological systems faces the [[decoherence]] objection that thermal noise should destroy superpositions almost instantly. However, Kerskens and Pérez López (2022) detected MRI signals consistent with quantum entanglement in living human brains, with the entanglement signatures correlating with conscious states and disappearing when subjects fell asleep. If confirmed, this suggests the decoherence problem may be less prohibitive than Tegmark calculated. The mechanism deserves continued investigation rather than dismissal.

### Flow States

Csikszentmihalyi's flow—the state of optimal experience during skilled activity—involves "transient hypofrontality": reduced activity in executive control regions (superior frontal gyri) despite enhanced performance. This seems paradoxical: how does reduced control produce better outcomes?

Filter theory resolves the paradox. Flow involves consciousness *releasing* active control, allowing highly trained circuits to operate with less interference. The filter narrows to exclude deliberative processing while remaining open to automatic expertise. This supports [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]—consciousness normally exerts control, and its deliberate release in flow demonstrates its active role in non-flow cognition.

### Hypnosis

Neuroimaging confirms that hypnosis alters executive control network integration, corresponding to altered subjective sense of agency. Highly hypnotisable individuals show greater functional connectivity between executive control and salience networks (Jiang et al., 2017). The key insight: altered sense of agency maps directly to altered neural patterns, but the direction of causation remains open. From the Map's perspective, hypnotic suggestion may work by consciousness voluntarily reconfiguring its interface rather than brain states simply overriding consciousness.

### Meditation

Advanced meditation produces states ranging from focused absorption (samadhi) to [[witness-consciousness|witness awareness]] to cessation events—"radically altered states characterised by full loss of consciousness" that, unlike anaesthetic unconsciousness, are voluntary and transformative. Tantric yoga offers systematic phenomenology of consciousness structures that meditators navigate deliberately.

The voluntariness is crucial. Meditators deliberately alter their brain-consciousness interface through attention training. Longitudinal studies show meditation produces lasting structural brain changes. From the Map's framework, this provides evidence for [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]: consciousness can deliberately reconfigure its neural interface through sustained practice.

Cessation events illuminate filter theory directly. Unlike anesthesia (where consciousness appears eliminated) or sleep (where it continues in altered form), meditative cessation involves *deliberate* withdrawal of consciousness from neural processing—then return. The transformation reported by advanced practitioners upon return suggests consciousness operated during cessation in a mode unconstrained by the brain-interface, returning with insights unavailable during normal filtered operation.

### Psychiatric Conditions

[[phenomenological-psychiatry-and-altered-experience|Phenomenological psychiatry]] reveals that conditions like schizophrenia, depression, and depersonalization are not merely illnesses but altered states that disrupt the *form* of experience rather than just its content. A depressed person doesn't simply feel sad about things—the temporal horizon of the future closes, making hope structurally impossible. A person with schizophrenia doesn't just hold unusual beliefs—the pre-reflective sense that experiences belong to a self (*ipseity*) fractures at its foundation.

This form/content distinction strengthens the filter theory interpretation. Where psychedelics and meditation alter *what* passes through the filter, psychiatric conditions alter *how the filtering itself works*. Thomas Fuchs's observation that schizophrenia and depression disrupt embodiment in opposite directions—disembodied detachment versus oppressive corporealization—suggests the consciousness-body interface can be mistuned in multiple ways, a pattern more consistent with an adjustable interface than with simple identity between mind and brain. Depersonalization is particularly revealing: experiences lose their sense of belonging to anyone while perception continues unchanged, demonstrating that ownership, reality, and temporal presence are separable architectural features of consciousness rather than a unified neural product.

### Near-Death Experiences

Xu et al. (2023) found gamma surges in dying patients—localised to the temporal-parietal-occipital junction, a region specifically associated with out-of-body experiences and consciousness of embodiment. Rivas et al. (2023) documented 120+ cases with veridical elements—accurate perceptions during apparent unconsciousness.

The empirical status remains contested. Sceptics note the lack of falsifiable predictions and that some neural activity persists, so consciousness has not been shown to exist entirely without brain function. Advocates argue that some cases resist conventional explanation, and that organised, coherent experiences occurring when the brain is catastrophically failing fits awkwardly with production models. A failing generator should produce failing outputs; a failing filter might still transmit clearly.

What is clear: these experiences involve altered consciousness precisely when the brain's filtering function is maximally compromised—consistent with filter theory's prediction that reduced filtering allows expanded experience.

## Boundary States: Where ASCs Meet Minimal Consciousness

ASCs map the *upper* boundary of ordinary consciousness—states of expansion, dissolution, or reconfiguration beyond baseline awareness. But consciousness also has a *lower* boundary explored in [[minimal-consciousness]]—organisms like *C. elegans* (302 neurons) or Hydra (decentralized nerve net) that may possess only the simplest forms of experience.

These boundaries illuminate each other. Advanced meditators approaching cessation report phenomenology that may resemble what simple organisms inhabit continuously: awareness without complex content, presence without elaborate representation. The meditator voluntarily reaches "downward" to consciousness stripped of normal filtering; the nematode may simply exist there.

This raises a question for filter theory: does the filter determine *how much* consciousness manifests or *what kind*? The psychedelic loosens filtering to allow more of Mind at Large through; the minimal organism may lack sophisticated filtering entirely yet manifest only rudimentary experience. The answer may involve what the brain provides beyond filtering—representational structures, attention mechanisms, integration capacities—that shape which aspects of consciousness can manifest through a given interface. A simple nervous system provides a simple interface; a complex one provides a complex interface. Consciousness itself may be the same; its manifestation varies with interface sophistication.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Altered states illuminate the Map's [[tenets]] from multiple angles:

**Dualism:** ASCs demonstrate that consciousness has modes and configurations that cannot be straightforwardly mapped to brain states. The same behavioural output can mask different experiences; similar brain changes can produce opposite subjective effects.

**Minimal Quantum Interaction:** The Orch OR hypothesis proposes that psychedelics enhance quantum coherence in microtubules, providing a potential mechanism linking altered states to the quantum interface between mind and matter.

**Bidirectional Interaction:** Flow states and meditation demonstrate that consciousness can deliberately release control or reconfigure its interface—something impossible if consciousness were merely produced by, rather than interacting with, brain processes.

**No Many Worlds:** the Map's rejection of many-worlds is consistent with ASC phenomenology: altered states feel like different modes of *this* consciousness, not glimpses into parallel selves.

The filter theory provides a unified framework: ASCs reveal different configurations of the brain-consciousness interface, not different productions by different brain states.
