The simulation hypothesis proposes that our reality is a computed simulation running on some substrate. This speculative idea, popularised by Nick Bostrom's probability argument and science fiction, cannot be empirically tested—but it has philosophical relevance for mind-matter interaction. If we take the hypothesis seriously as a thought experiment, certain objections to consciousness influencing physics turn out to rest on contingent assumptions rather than necessary truths.

This page examines the simulation hypothesis and its implications for The Unfinishable Map's [[tenets]]—particularly bidirectional interaction and the [[locality]] problem. The hypothesis is valuable as a diagnostic tool for revealing hidden assumptions in our metaphysics, not as an empirical theory or a positive account of reality.

## The Hypothesis

**Bostrom's Argument (2003):** At least one of three propositions is true: (1) almost all civilisations go extinct before developing simulation capability, (2) almost all capable civilisations choose not to run ancestor simulations, or (3) we are almost certainly in a simulation. If civilisations typically survive and run simulations, simulated beings vastly outnumber "base reality" beings.

Even setting aside probability arguments, the simulation hypothesis is possible—reality could be computed rather than fundamental. This possibility alone has philosophical implications.

## Why This Matters for Consciousness

Even as a thought experiment, the simulation hypothesis exposes which metaphysical commitments are necessary and which are merely assumed:

### Locality Would Become Trivial

In any simulation, spatial relationships are represented data, not fundamental constraints. The "distance" between two neurons is a number in memory—not a gap that information must cross. The [[locality]] objection—how does consciousness coordinate across spatial distances?—would rest on an assumption (that space is fundamental) rather than a necessary truth. This doesn't answer the locality objection in our reality, but reveals that it presupposes a specific metaphysical picture.

### Mind-Matter Interface Has Precedent

We routinely couple mental states to simulated physics: a player's intention moves a character, a programmer's decision changes physical laws. The analogy is imperfect in a way that matters: players exist *outside* the game, while we're supposedly *inside* the simulation. The player's consciousness is not constituted by the game world—their causal access comes from an external position unavailable to simulated beings.

What the analogy does establish is that consciousness-physics coupling is not conceptually incoherent. The claim that "consciousness cannot in principle interact with physics" must contend with cases where it already does, even if the mechanism (external access) differs from what would be required for beings within a simulation. This is a point about conceivability, not feasibility—and conceivability is what the diagnostic purpose of this thought experiment requires.

### Physical Laws Are Implementation Choices

The fine-tuned constants of physics, the form of quantum mechanics, the apparent closure of physical causation—all become contingent facts about how this simulation was configured. Apparent barriers to mind-matter interaction might be features of a particular implementation rather than necessary truths. The simulation hypothesis doesn't show that closure *is* contingent—but it shows that the assumption of closure's necessity deserves scrutiny.

## Relation to Site Perspective

### Dualism

The simulation hypothesis is compatible with dualism and may even support it. If physical reality is computed, then:
- Physical processes are information processing
- Consciousness might be something *about* that processing—or something beyond it
- The substrate running the simulation adds an extra layer of reality beyond the simulated physics

Simulated physics isn't "really" physical in the fundamental sense. This creates logical space for consciousness to be something different from the simulated matter we observe.

### Minimal Quantum Interaction

Quantum mechanics might be the point where the simulation handles indeterminacy. If the simulator doesn't pre-calculate every quantum outcome (perhaps for efficiency), consciousness influencing these outcomes would be:
- Computationally minimal (operating only at undetermined points)
- Physically undetectable (indistinguishable from "real" randomness)
- Consistent with the simulated physical laws

The "minimal quantum interaction" tenet describes exactly what a well-designed mind-matter interface would look like in a simulation.

**Timescale caveat**: The standard [[decoherence]] objection—that quantum coherence decays rapidly in warm biological systems—applies within the simulation regardless. The Map takes decoherence seriously as an open challenge with specific responses (the measurement problem gap, biological quantum effects, the Zeno mechanism—see the [[decoherence|decoherence article]]). In the simulation context, the hypothesis adds only that such an interface might have been *designed*—not that physics magically cooperates.

### Bidirectional Interaction

As noted above, simulations routinely support bidirectional interaction between conscious operators and simulated physics. We are proof of concept: we are conscious, we run simulations, and we influence them.

If our reality is a simulation, the question becomes not "is bidirectional interaction possible?" but "was it included in the design?"

### No Many Worlds

Whether the simulation hypothesis supports single-outcome quantum mechanics depends on a central question: can quantum physics be faithfully simulated without the computation itself implying MWI's branching structure? If faithful simulation requires branching computation, the hypothesis could *support* many-worlds rather than undermine it.

If the simulation implements objective collapse at the substrate level, the picture favours single outcomes: the simulator calculates one outcome per measurement, other "branches" are simply not computed, and indexical identity is preserved because there's only one instance of each observer.

Under these conditions, simulation avoids the [[haecceity|indexical identity problem]] that MWI faces—why am I *this* branch-instance rather than another? For the Map's commitment to [[phenomenology-of-choice|choice phenomenology]], this matters: the felt reality of selecting one option aligns better with genuine single outcomes than with decoherence-masked branching.

## The Meta-Problem: Where Is Consciousness?

A simulation running on physical substrate is still physical—the computer exists in base reality even if its simulated world doesn't. This raises a crucial question: where does consciousness reside?

### Three Possibilities

**Consciousness in the simulation only**: The simulated beings are conscious; the simulation substrate is merely computational. This creates an emergence mystery—how does consciousness arise from simulated rather than "real" matter? If consciousness can emerge from simulated physics, why not from base physics directly?

**Consciousness at the substrate level**: The simulators are conscious; we are their computations. This preserves the Map's dualism—consciousness is fundamental at base reality—but makes us philosophical zombies with respect to genuine experience. The Map's framework resists this: if we experience, we're conscious, regardless of our substrate.

**Consciousness at both levels**: Both simulators and simulated beings are conscious. This may follow if [[quantum-consciousness|consciousness depends on quantum effects]] that the simulation faithfully implements. If the simulation faithfully implements quantum mechanics, it reproduces the conditions that give rise to consciousness—not merely behaviour that resembles it.

The Map's framework suggests the third option. If consciousness operates through [[measurement-problem|quantum measurement]] and the simulation implements quantum mechanics (rather than merely approximating classical physics), then simulated beings might be genuinely conscious. The hard problem shifts from "how does matter produce consciousness?" to "under what computational conditions does consciousness arise?"—but it doesn't disappear.

### Computational Limits Within Simulations

If we are simulated, we inherit all [[computational-cognitive-limits|computational limits]]: Gödel's incompleteness, the halting problem, Rice's theorem. This creates a tension with Penrose-style arguments: if consciousness genuinely grasps Gödel sentences that formal systems cannot prove, it transcends computation—yet simulated computations *can't* genuinely grasp these truths. Either the simulation hypothesis is false, Lucas-Penrose arguments fail, or consciousness operates non-computationally even within the simulation. The Map's commitment to bidirectional interaction suggests the third option.

A further question: are these limits [[natural-vs-designed-limits|natural features of finite cognition, or designed constraints]]? A simulator could impose limits beyond those inherent to computation itself.

This has implications for [[ai-consciousness]]: if we're simulated and conscious, digital systems might also achieve consciousness under the right conditions—the barrier would be architectural, not substrate-based.

## Objections and Responses

### The Regress Problem

If we're simulated, is the simulator also simulated? And their simulator?

This regress must bottom out somewhere in non-simulated reality—unless reality is somehow self-simulating or the concept of "base reality" is incoherent. But the same logic applies to any causal chain; we don't reject causation because causes have causes.

### The Incredulity Objection

"Surely we'd notice if we were in a simulation?"

We have no experience of non-simulated reality to compare against. A sufficiently sophisticated simulation might be indistinguishable from reality in practice, though whether this holds in principle depends on questions about computational resources and whether consciousness is computable. If indistinguishable, we could only detect flaws—and perhaps physics already contains candidates (quantum mechanics, the measurement problem, consciousness).

### The Triviality Objection

"Everything is compatible with the simulation hypothesis, so it explains nothing."

The simulation hypothesis is speculative metaphysics, not empirical science. It cannot be falsified with current methods. If all you want is empirical purchase on the mind-body problem, this hypothesis provides none.

But triviality requires sameness, not just compatibility. The simulation hypothesis does two distinct kinds of philosophical work:

**Constructive modelling.** The hypothesis provides a framework in which mind-matter interaction is not merely asserted as possible but structurally modelled. In the simulation framework, consciousness interfaces with a computational layer—offering an architecture where interaction works, not just an argument that it could. This is substantively different from bare conceivability arguments.

**Assumption identification.** The hypothesis makes specific metaphysical commitments visible as contingent design choices rather than necessary truths. Causal closure becomes an implementation decision. [[locality|Spatial relationships]] become represented data rather than fundamental constraints. Single quantum outcomes become a feature of computational economy (with caveats about quantum computation noted in the No Many Worlds section). Each of these targets a specific objection to interactionist dualism with a specific structural alternative—they are not variations on a single "everything is contingent" claim.

What it cannot do: it doesn't explain consciousness (relocating the mystery is not solving it), doesn't solve [[decoherence]] (the challenge persists within simulated physics), and provides no empirical tests.

### Distinguishing From Cartesian Skepticism

A natural objection: doesn't the simulation hypothesis merely repackage Descartes' evil demon? Both scenarios suggest our metaphysical assumptions might be wrong—so what does simulation add?

The difference is structural specificity. Cartesian skepticism and brain-in-a-vat scenarios are purely destructive—they question whether our beliefs are justified but provide no alternative architecture. They say "everything might be wrong" without specifying *how* it could be otherwise. The simulation hypothesis proposes a definite alternative structure: computational substrate, interface layers, design choices. This specificity is what allows it to target particular assumptions rather than undermining all assumptions equally.

A Cartesian demon could deceive us about anything, which is precisely why demon scenarios lack diagnostic power—they don't distinguish contingent from necessary features of reality. The simulation hypothesis does: it identifies which features of physics would be implementation choices (spatial relationships, causal closure) and which would persist regardless of substrate (logical structure, mathematical truths). This selective contingency is what makes the hypothesis a diagnostic tool rather than a sceptical solvent.

## The Illusionist Challenge

[[illusionism|Illusionists]] might argue that the simulation hypothesis dissolves consciousness-related puzzles because there's nothing genuinely puzzling to begin with. If phenomenal consciousness is a misrepresentation by introspective systems, the "hard problem" disappears whether or not we're simulated.

From the Map's perspective, this challenge faces a regress. If simulated beings have quasi-phenomenal states, then either: (1) the quasi-phenomenal is itself simulated, but misrepresentation requires something to be misrepresented *to*—the [[philosophical-zombies|zombie reformulation]] applies; or (2) the quasi-phenomenal operates at the substrate level, but then the delusion is a real phenomenal state and illusionism hasn't eliminated phenomenality, only relocated it.

From the Map's dualist standpoint, the simulation hypothesis poses a question for illusionism: simulating an illusion that depends on *seeming* requires implementing whatever makes seeming possible. An illusionist would respond that "seeming" is a functional state that computation straightforwardly implements—so the force of this challenge depends on whether functional replication of seeming exhausts what needs explaining.

## What Would Challenge This View?

The simulation hypothesis would be undermined or significantly constrained if:

1. **Consciousness requires non-computational substrate.** If Penrose-type arguments are correct—that consciousness involves non-algorithmic processes no Turing machine can implement—then simulated beings on classical computers would be [[philosophical-zombies|philosophical zombies]]. The hypothesis would remain possible (we might be in a quantum simulation) but would lose its power to dissolve mind-matter puzzles.

2. **Quantum mechanics proves incompatible with simulation.** If continuous aspects of quantum field theory cannot be computationally approximated to arbitrary precision, simulating our physics might be impossible in principle. Classical simulation of quantum effects remains an open question.

3. **The hard problem dissolves without simulation.** If physicalism succeeds in explaining phenomenal consciousness, the hypothesis loses its distinctive appeal. Its value trades on the hard problem's intractability.

## Status

The hypothesis functions as a diagnostic tool for examining assumptions. Many objections to interactionist dualism presuppose a metaphysical picture that the simulation framework reveals as contingent. "Revealing assumptions as contingent" is more modest than "answering objections"—the objections may still hold within our experienced reality—but showing they are not logically necessary is specific philosophical work.

Whether or not we are simulated, the *possibility* of simulation illuminates what's truly necessary versus merely assumed in our metaphysics. That illumination—modest but genuine—is the hypothesis's contribution to the Map.
