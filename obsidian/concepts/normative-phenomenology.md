Normative phenomenology is the systematic first-person investigation of how normative properties—moral obligation, epistemic compellingness, aesthetic value, prudential weight—present themselves in conscious experience. Where [[phenomenology]] investigates the structures of experience in general, normative phenomenology applies the phenomenological method specifically to the evaluative dimension: what does it feel like to encounter a demand, perceive an obligation, or recognise beauty? The Unfinishable Map holds that this method is indispensable. If [[phenomenal-normativity]] is correct—if normativity is built into the phenomenal character of certain experiences—then the primary access to normative reality runs through first-person investigation.

## Method and Scope

Normative phenomenology inherits the tools of classical [[phenomenology]]: the epoché (suspension of assumptions about the external world), eidetic variation (imaginative manipulation to isolate essential structures), and careful description of what appears in consciousness. But it applies these tools to a specific target: the normative dimension of experience.

The epoché in normative phenomenology brackets metaethical theories—whether normativity is "real," projected, constructed, or evolved—and attends to how normative properties appear. Before asking whether moral obligations exist mind-independently, normative phenomenology asks: what is the structure of the experience of being obligated? What does epistemic compellingness feel like from the inside? How does aesthetic value present itself?

This bracketing is not scepticism about normativity. It is methodological discipline: describe first, theorise after. The descriptions become data that any adequate metaethical theory must accommodate.

### Scope Across Normative Domains

The [[phenomenology-of-normative-properties]] article maps four domains where normative experience arises: moral, epistemic, aesthetic, and prudential. Normative phenomenology investigates all four, treating the diversity as evidence about the structure of normativity itself. The shared demand character—the fact that all normative experiences present their objects as calling for response—is a phenomenological finding, not a theoretical assumption.

This breadth distinguishes normative phenomenology from moral phenomenology alone. The phenomenology of obligation, the phenomenology of evidential weight, the phenomenology of beauty, and the phenomenology of prudential pull are related investigations within a unified methodological programme.

## Phenomenological Findings

### Demand Character

The most consistent finding across normative domains is demand character: normative properties present themselves as requiring response. This is not the causal push of physical force but the felt address of something that matters.

Consider the experience of encountering a valid deductive argument whose conclusion you resist. There is a phenomenal pull toward acceptance—cool, impersonal, insistent. You can refuse the conclusion, but the refusal registers as resistance to something, not as the absence of pressure. The demand is experienced as coming from the argument, not from within oneself.

[[moral-perception|Moral demands]] have a different phenomenal texture—warmer, more urgent, often other-directed. But they share the structural feature: the demand presents itself as appropriate, as warranted by the situation rather than imposed by the subject.

### Independence from Attitude

Normative phenomenology reveals that normative properties present themselves as independent of the subject's preferences. The wrongness of cruelty does not disappear when one stops caring about it. The validity of an argument does not weaken because one wishes the conclusion were false. This phenomenal independence is a structural feature of normative experience, not a theoretical posit.

The independence distinguishes normative experience from desire. Wanting coffee and perceiving obligation are phenomenologically distinct even when both motivate action. Desire presents its object as wanted; normative experience presents its object as warranting response regardless of want.

### Gradedness and Salience

Normative properties present themselves as admitting degrees. Some wrongs are graver than others; some evidence is more compelling; some beauty is more arresting. This gradedness is experienced, not merely judged—the difference between a minor discourtesy and a grave injustice registers phenomenally before any deliberative comparison.

Normative salience—the capacity of normative properties to capture attention—also varies. Moral emergencies seize attention; subtle aesthetic qualities require cultivated receptivity. Normative phenomenology studies this variation in salience as evidence about the structure of normative consciousness.

## Relation to Adjacent Concepts

Normative phenomenology intersects with several related concepts on the Map but is distinct from each.

**[[phenomenal-normativity]]** is the metaphysical thesis that certain phenomenal states carry intrinsic normative force. Normative phenomenology is the method for investigating whether and how this thesis is borne out in experience. Phenomenal normativity is a claim; normative phenomenology is the investigation that produces evidence for or against it.

**[[moral-perception]]** is the capacity to directly apprehend ethical properties. Normative phenomenology is the broader methodological programme within which moral perception is studied—alongside epistemic, aesthetic, and prudential perception.

**[[phenomenological-evidence]]** provides the epistemological framework: how first-person reports count as evidence. Normative phenomenology generates a specific kind of phenomenological evidence—evidence about the normative dimension of experience.

**[[cognitive-phenomenology]]** investigates the felt character of thinking. Normative phenomenology overlaps where thinking has normative content—the felt compellingness of valid inference, the phenomenal character of understanding why something matters.

## Methodological Challenges

### The Corruption Problem

Investigating normative experience risks corrupting the data. Attending to one's moral reactions may alter them. The meditator observing anger may dissolve it; the philosopher analysing obligation may intellectualise it beyond recognition. Normative phenomenology must navigate between two failures: too little attention (yielding unreliable reports) and too much (altering the phenomenon under study).

Microphenomenological techniques address this partly by using present-tense re-enactment rather than retrospective analysis. But the tension between observation and alteration remains a genuine limitation, parallel to challenges in [[phenomenological-evidence|phenomenological evidence]] generally.

### Cultural Saturation

Normative concepts are culturally transmitted. When investigating what obligation feels like, can one bracket the cultural framing of obligation one has absorbed? The epoché aims to suspend theoretical assumptions, but normative experience may be constituted partly by cultural training in ways that resist bracketing.

The cross-cultural response mirrors phenomenology's general strategy: if investigators from historically independent traditions converge on similar descriptions of normative phenomenal structures, cultural constitution cannot fully explain the convergence. Buddhist descriptions of dukkha's demand character, Confucian descriptions of ren's pull, and Western descriptions of moral obligation share structural features despite different cultural embedding.

### The Is-Ought Boundary

A persistent concern: does normative phenomenology collapse the distinction between describing normative experience and endorsing normative claims? If one describes obligation as genuinely demanding, has one already taken a metaethical position?

Normative phenomenology maintains the distinction by bracketing endorsement. Describing how obligation presents itself—as a demand that appears warranted—is not the same as claiming obligations are real. An illusionist about normativity could accept the phenomenological description while denying that the demand character reflects normative reality. The descriptions constrain but do not determine metaethical theory.

## Contemplative Approaches

[[contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness-theories|Contemplative traditions]] contribute substantially to normative phenomenology. Sustained meditative attention reveals normative microstructure invisible to casual introspection.

Buddhist *vipassanā* discloses how hedonic valence (*vedanā*) arises moment-to-moment as a constitutive feature of experience, not an evaluative overlay. Practitioners report that sustained attention reveals normativity as woven into the fabric of each moment of awareness—not added by reflection but present before reflection begins.

Christian contemplative traditions describe encounters with moral demand that deepen under sustained prayer. Simone Weil's concept of attention as "selfless receptivity" treats moral perception as a quality of consciousness cultivated through disciplined practice.

These traditions function as laboratories for normative phenomenology: environments where subjects train systematic attention to the normative dimension of experience and report their findings. The convergence across traditions—sustained attention reveals more normative structure, not less—constitutes evidence that normativity is discovered rather than projected.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Normative phenomenology connects to the Map's [[tenets|foundational commitments]] as a methodological complement to its metaphysical positions.

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]**: If normative experience has irreducible phenomenal character—if the felt wrongness of cruelty cannot be captured in functional or neural description—then normative phenomenology provides evidence for dualism in the evaluative domain. The [[explanatory-gap]] extends from "why is there something it is like to see red?" to "why does injustice feel like a demand?" Normative phenomenology systematically discloses this extended gap.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]**: Normative phenomenology reveals the motivational structure of normative experience. Perceived obligations drive action; felt evidential weight shapes belief. If consciousness were epiphenomenal, the consistent link between normative phenomenal character and motivated response would be inexplicable. Normative phenomenology documents this link as a structural feature of experience.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]**: Reducing normative experience to emotional projection or evolutionary conditioning appears parsimonious. But normative phenomenology reveals a rich, structured domain of experience that reductive accounts must explain away. The apparent simplicity of projectivism is achieved by ignoring the primary data—what normative experience is actually like when carefully investigated.
