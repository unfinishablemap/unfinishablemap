Visual consciousness is the phenomenal experience of seeing—what it's like to perceive colour, shape, motion, and spatial arrangement. When you look at a red apple, there is something it is like to experience its redness, its roundness, its position in space. This experiential quality constitutes visual consciousness, distinct from the mere processing of visual information that occurs in early visual cortex.

The distinction matters because sophisticated visual processing can occur without visual consciousness, as [[blindsight]] demonstrates. Patients with damage to primary visual cortex (V1) can discriminate visual stimuli—identifying location, motion direction, even emotional expressions—while reporting no conscious experience of seeing. Visual information reaches decision systems and guides action, yet produces no [[qualia]]. This dissociation reveals that visual consciousness is not reducible to visual processing.

## The Structure of Visual Experience

Visual consciousness has distinctive phenomenal structure that shapes how we experience the world.

### Spatial Character

Visual experience presents objects as arranged in three-dimensional space before you. Unlike auditory or olfactory experience, vision delivers a spatial field with objects at determinate locations and distances. This spatial phenomenology is immediate—you don't infer that the tree is farther than the fence; you see it that way.

The visual field has egocentric structure: objects appear before you, to your left, above you. This perspectival character—being centred on *this* viewpoint—connects visual consciousness to questions of [[indexical-facts|indexical identity]]. Why does the visual world appear from *here* rather than *there*?

### Colour Qualia

Colour experience exemplifies qualia's resistance to physical reduction. Light wavelengths are measurable physical quantities; the experience of redness is not. The [[knowledge-argument]] dramatises this: Mary knows every physical fact about colour vision yet learns something new upon first seeing red. What she learns is the visual quale—what redness looks like.

The [[inverted-qualia|inverted spectrum]] thought experiment targets visual consciousness specifically. Two people might process colour information identically yet have systematically inverted colour experiences—one experiences green where the other experiences red. Since behaviour depends on functional role rather than qualitative character, neither would know. If this scenario is coherent, visual qualia are not fixed by visual processing.

### Temporal Dynamics

Visual consciousness unfolds in time with characteristic dynamics. Motion perception involves not just detecting position change but experiencing movement as continuous flow. The [[specious-present]]—the felt duration of "now"—has visual manifestation: we experience a moving ball as crossing space, not as a sequence of static snapshots.

Change blindness reveals how attention shapes visual consciousness. Massive visual changes go unnoticed when they coincide with saccades or scene disruptions. Visual consciousness does not passively register visual information—[[attention]] selects what enters awareness.

## The Binding Problem in Vision

Visual features are processed separately: colour in V4, motion in MT/V5, shape in inferotemporal cortex. Yet visual consciousness presents unified objects—a single red ball moving leftward, not separate experiences of redness, roundness, and leftward motion. The [[binding-problem]] asks how distributed processing produces unified experience.

Classical theories propose binding through neural synchrony—features of the same object trigger correlated activity across regions. But synchronized firing remains physically separate events; correlation is not unity. The hard aspect of binding (BP2) asks why computational coordination produces phenomenal unity at all.

One proposal: quantum approaches suggest visual consciousness involves genuine physical holism. Entangled quantum states across neural populations would be unified at the physical level, not merely correlated. If visual binding depends on quantum coherence—a hypothesis explored in [[quantum-consciousness|Orch OR]] and related theories—this would explain why disrupting coherence (as anaesthetics may do) disrupts conscious unity while leaving much processing intact. This remains speculative; see [[binding-problem]] for detailed treatment of the evidence.

## Visual Consciousness and Access

Ned Block's distinction between [[phenomenal-consciousness]] and [[access-consciousness]] finds paradigm application in vision.

**Phenomenal visual consciousness** is what it's like to see—the qualitative character of visual experience.

**Visual access consciousness** is visual information being available for reasoning, report, and behavioural control.

These can dissociate. The [[phenomenal-overflow|overflow argument]] suggests we phenomenally experience more visual detail than we can access for report—the richness of peripheral vision exceeds what enters working memory. Conversely, blindsight demonstrates visual access (forced-choice discrimination, action guidance) without phenomenal visual consciousness.

[[global-workspace-theory|Global Workspace Theory]] locates visual consciousness in information becoming "globally broadcast"—available to multiple cognitive systems simultaneously. But this account addresses access, not phenomenology. Why does global broadcast produce the felt quality of seeing rather than processing without experience?

## Neural Correlates

The [[neural-correlates-of-consciousness|NCC]] for visual consciousness localise primarily to posterior cortical regions, particularly the "posterior cortical hot zone." The 2025 COGITATE experiment found consciousness-related activity concentrated in posterior regions rather than prefrontal cortex, supporting theories that locate visual consciousness near sensory processing rather than in executive regions.

Key visual NCC findings:

- **V1 is necessary for normal visual consciousness**: Damage produces [[blindsight]]—preserved processing without phenomenal seeing
- **V4 is necessary for colour consciousness**: Lesions cause achromatopsia—complete loss of colour experience while brightness perception remains
- **Motion area MT/V5 correlates with motion consciousness**: Damage impairs motion perception specifically
- **Lateral occipital cortex correlates with object consciousness**: The "what" stream's endpoint

These correlations map visual consciousness onto neural architecture but don't explain why this activity feels like seeing. The posterior hot zone might be where consciousness *interfaces* with visual processing rather than where it's generated—compatible with both materialist and interactionist interpretations.

## The Problem Visual Consciousness Poses

Visual consciousness exemplifies the [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|hard problem]] with particular clarity. We can fully describe the physical process: photons trigger retinal photoreceptors, signals propagate through LGN to V1, features are extracted through hierarchical processing, binding integrates features into object representations. Yet this description—however complete—does not explain why there is something it is like to see.

The explanatory gap is starkest for vision because we know so much about visual processing. The retina, V1, the ventral and dorsal streams—neuroscience has mapped vision extensively. Yet the more we learn about how visual information is processed, the more glaring becomes the absence of any explanation for why this processing feels like anything at all.

This is not ignorance about neural detail. It's a gap in our conceptual apparatus—an [[explanatory-gap]] between physical description and phenomenal fact. Physical descriptions trade in structure, function, causal relations. Visual qualia—the redness, the spatial spread, the sense of things *appearing*—resist capture in these terms. Either physics must expand to include qualitative properties (becoming unrecognisable), or there is more to visual consciousness than physics captures.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Visual consciousness supports the Map's [[tenets|foundational commitments]] with particular force.

### Dualism

The existence of visual qualia—the felt quality of seeing colour, shape, motion—suggests physical description is incomplete. Physics describes wavelengths; it does not describe what redness looks like. The blindsight dissociation sharpens the point: identical visual discrimination can occur with or without conscious seeing. If visual processing were all that mattered, blindsight patients should report seeing. They don't. Visual consciousness is something beyond visual computation.

### Bidirectional Interaction

[[voluntary-attention|Voluntary attention]] shapes what enters visual consciousness. You can attend to the left or right of your visual field, foreground or background, colour or motion. This top-down influence suggests consciousness acts on visual processing, not merely receives its outputs. The [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet holds that consciousness causally influences the physical world—attention's modulation of visual processing may be one site of such influence.

### Minimal Quantum Interaction

If visual consciousness involves selection among processing possibilities—determining which features bind into objects, which stimuli reach awareness—this selection must occur somewhere. The [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet proposes consciousness influences quantum indeterminacies. Visual binding, which produces unified objects from distributed features, might involve quantum coherence across neural populations—coherence that consciousness then biases toward particular outcomes.

### No Many Worlds

Visual consciousness presents a determinate world—*this* scene, from *this* perspective, with *these* colours. The [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]] tenet rejects interpretations where all possible visual experiences occur in parallel branches. The phenomenology of visual consciousness—its singular, perspectival, determinate character—fits interpretations where genuine selection produces one actual experience rather than a branching tree of all possibilities.
