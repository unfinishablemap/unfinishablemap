Phenomenal consciousness (P-consciousness) is what it is *like* to be in a mental state—the subjective, experiential quality that accompanies perception, thought, emotion, and sensation. When you see red, taste coffee, or feel pain, there is something it is like to have that experience. That "something it is like" is phenomenal consciousness.

P-consciousness is the hard problem's core. Physical theories can explain information processing, behavioral control, and cognitive function—what Ned Block calls [[access-consciousness]] (A-consciousness). What they cannot explain is why processing feels like anything at all. The [[explanatory-gap|explanatory gap]] between neural activity and subjective experience defines the challenge consciousness poses to [[materialism]].

## Definition and Core Features {#definition}

Ned Block introduced "phenomenal consciousness" in 1995 to isolate the experiential aspect of consciousness from functional aspects. His formulation: P-consciousness is "experience; what makes a mental state phenomenally conscious is that there is something it is like to be in that state."

This definition echoes Thomas Nagel's 1974 formulation: "an organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism—something it is like *for the organism*."

### The "What It's Like" Criterion

The defining mark of P-consciousness is subjective character—the felt quality of experience. Consider:

- **Vision**: The redness you experience when seeing a ripe tomato
- **Pain**: The sharp, unpleasant quality of stubbing your toe
- **Taste**: The bitterness of dark chocolate
- **Emotion**: The weighted, constricted feeling of sadness
- **Thought**: The phenomenology of understanding a mathematical proof (see [[cognitive-phenomenology]])

Each involves distinctive qualitative character. That character is P-consciousness.

### Relationship to Qualia

[[Qualia]] are the individual instances or types of phenomenal properties—the redness of red, the painfulness of pain. P-consciousness is the broader category: the fact that there is something it is like to have experiences at all. All qualia involve P-consciousness, but P-consciousness encompasses more than discrete qualia—it includes the overall character of conscious states, the unity of experience, and the subjective perspective itself.

Qualia are often characterized as intrinsic (not defined relationally), private (not directly accessible to others), ineffable (resist complete description), and directly apprehensible (immediately known to the experiencer). These features make qualia—and P-consciousness generally—resistant to third-person scientific explanation.

## The Access/Phenomenal Distinction {#distinction}

Block's 1995 paper "On a Confusion about a Function of Consciousness" argued philosophers and scientists conflate two distinct concepts:

**[[Access-consciousness|Access consciousness]]**: Information poised for global control—available for reasoning, verbal report, and rational guidance of action. A-consciousness is defined functionally by what information *does*.

**Phenomenal consciousness**: The experiential quality of mental states—what they *feel like*. P-consciousness is defined by subjective character, not by functional role.

### Why the Distinction Matters

The distinction reveals what physicalist theories can and cannot explain:

**Physicalism succeeds at access**: Neural mechanisms can plausibly explain when information becomes globally available. [[Global-workspace-theory|Global Workspace Theory]] identifies how information gets broadcast to multiple cognitive systems. Dehaene's Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW) specifies prefrontal-parietal circuits implementing broadcast. These theories explain A-consciousness.

**Physicalism struggles with phenomenology**: Even if we fully understand access mechanisms—how information is selected, broadcast, integrated—we haven't explained why globally broadcast information feels like anything. A complete account of the neural machinery leaves the [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|hard problem]] untouched: why is there subjective experience accompanying these processes?

### Dissociations

Block argues A-consciousness and P-consciousness can come apart:

**Access without phenomenology?** [[Blindsight]] patients report no visual experience in their blind field (no P-consciousness) yet can "guess" stimulus properties with above-chance accuracy (degraded access). If true blindsight involves zero phenomenology despite functional use of information, access and phenomenology dissociate. (Some theorists dispute this, arguing residual phenomenology exists but goes unreported.)

**Phenomenology without full access?** Block's overflow argument: Sperling's iconic memory experiments suggest subjects experience more letters than they can report—rich phenomenology exceeding access capacity. The phenomenal field may be richer than what enters working memory and becomes A-conscious. However, this interpretation remains contested—deflationary readings suggest subjects don't literally experience all letters but rather have a general impression of "many letters" that gets interpreted as specific experience after the fact.

If these dissociations are real, A-consciousness and P-consciousness are distinct properties. Functional explanations explain access, not phenomenology. The debate over phenomenal overflow highlights a methodological challenge: how do we empirically distinguish genuine phenomenology from post-hoc cognitive interpretation?

## The Hard Problem {#hard-problem}

David Chalmers's "hard problem" formulation centers on P-consciousness: "Why is the performance of these functions [information integration, reportability, attention] accompanied by experience?" Even if we solve all "easy problems" (explaining cognitive functions), the hard problem remains.

### The Structure of the Problem

The hard problem has two related aspects:

1. **The existence question**: Why does physical processing give rise to phenomenology at all? Why isn't everything just "dark inside" like a [[philosophical-zombies|philosophical zombie]]?

2. **The character question**: Given that phenomenology exists, why does this brain state feel like *this* rather than *that*? Why does 620nm light feel red rather than blue or smell-ish?

Both questions resist standard scientific explanation. We can explain *what* neural states correlate with specific experiences (the [[neural-correlates-of-consciousness|neural correlates]]). We cannot explain *why* those correlations exist—what makes a particular pattern of neural firing feel like anything, and why it feels the particular way it does.

### Zombies and the Conceivability Argument

The [[philosophical-zombies|zombie argument]] leverages P-consciousness's resistance to functional explanation. A philosophical zombie is a being physically and functionally identical to you—same atoms, same behavior, same information processing—but with no phenomenal consciousness. Nothing it is like to be a zombie.

If zombies are conceivable (not logically contradictory), then P-consciousness is not logically entailed by physical/functional facts. Chalmers argues:
1. Zombies are conceivable
2. Conceivability (absent defeating factors) indicates metaphysical possibility
3. Therefore P-consciousness is not necessitated by the physical
4. Therefore materialism is false

Critics challenge premise 1 (zombies may not be genuinely conceivable) or the move from conceivability to possibility. But the argument's force comes from phenomenology's apparent logical independence from function. You can specify all functional facts without thereby specifying phenomenal facts.

### The Knowledge Argument

Frank Jackson's [[knowledge-argument|Mary's Room]] thought experiment similarly targets P-consciousness. Mary knows all physical facts about color vision—wavelengths, retinal processing, V4 activation—but has never seen color (she's been in a black-and-white room). When she finally sees red, she learns something new: what it's like to see red.

If Mary learns something new despite knowing all physical facts, phenomenal facts are not identical to physical facts. The "what it's like" aspect—P-consciousness—exceeds physical description.

Physicalists respond via the [[phenomenal-concepts-strategy|phenomenal concept strategy]] (discussed below).

## Inverted Qualia and Phenomenal Character {#inversion}

[[Inverted-qualia|Inverted qualia]] scenarios reveal P-consciousness's independence from behavior and function. Imagine two people with systematically inverted color experiences: what looks red to you looks green to me, and vice versa. If we've both been raised with these inverted experiences, our behavior will be identical—we'll both call ripe tomatoes "red," stop at red lights, prefer the same paintings.

If such inversion is coherent, then:
1. Phenomenal facts (what experiences are like) can vary while functional facts (behavior, information processing) remain constant
2. Therefore phenomenal properties are not identical to functional properties
3. Therefore P-consciousness is not reducible to function

Critics dispute whether inverted qualia are genuinely possible. Perhaps color experiences are necessarily tied to their typical causes and effects. But the intuition that inversion is conceivable reflects P-consciousness's apparent logical independence from external relations.

## The Phenomenal Concept Strategy {#pcs}

The [[phenomenal-concepts-strategy|phenomenal concept strategy]] (PCS) is the most sophisticated physicalist response to anti-physicalist arguments based on P-consciousness. Rather than denying the [[explanatory-gap|explanatory gap]] exists, PCS locates the gap in our *concepts* rather than in *reality*.

### The Core Idea

PCS holds that phenomenal concepts—the concepts we deploy when introspecting experience, like RED when seeing red—have special features making them *seem* conceptually independent from physical concepts. This conceptual independence creates the *appearance* of an ontological gap even though consciousness is entirely physical.

The analogy: "heat" and "molecular motion" are different concepts referring to the same property. Before thermodynamics, there seemed to be an explanatory gap between felt warmth and particle motion. But the gap was epistemic, not ontological. PCS claims phenomenal and physical concepts similarly pick out the same (physical) properties via different modes of presentation.

### Major Versions

**Brian Loar's recognitional account**: Phenomenal concepts are direct recognitional concepts—when having an experience, we deploy a concept that refers directly to that experience without intermediary description. This directness explains why phenomenal concepts seem unrelated to physical descriptions.

**David Papineau's quotational account**: Phenomenal concepts are formed by "quoting" experiences—experiences are literally *present* in thought in a way external objects are not. When thinking about redness, the experience of red is itself part of the concept.

**Katalin Balog's constitutional account**: Token experiences serve as modes of presentation of phenomenal properties. The concept PAIN is partly constituted by a token pain experience.

### Chalmers's Master Argument

In "Phenomenal Concepts and the Explanatory Gap," Chalmers presents a dilemmatic response to PCS. Let C be the features of phenomenal concepts that PCS invokes to explain the gap.

**The dilemma:**

1. **If physical duplicates lacking C are conceivable**, then C itself is not physically explicable. There would be an explanatory gap between physical processes and C. PCS just relocates the hard problem from consciousness to phenomenal concepts.

2. **If physical duplicates lacking C are not conceivable**, then C cannot explain our epistemic situation. If C is entailed by physics, [[philosophical-zombies|zombies]] would have C too—the same concepts, the same apparent gap. So C doesn't explain why *we* find P-consciousness puzzling if zombies would have identical concepts.

Either way, PCS fails. Either phenomenal concepts aren't physically explicable (first horn), or they can't explain the explanatory gap (second horn).

### Dualist Assessment

PCS deserves serious engagement—it's the strongest physicalist response available. But Chalmers's master argument suggests deep problems. The persistence of the explanatory gap, despite sophisticated attempts to locate it purely at the conceptual level, points to something about P-consciousness itself that resists physical explanation.

Even PCS proponents accept something special about phenomenal concepts. The debate is whether this specialness is itself physically explicable. The dilemma suggests it isn't.

## Illusionism: Denying P-Consciousness {#illusionism}

Some philosophers—including Daniel Dennett and Keith Frankish—adopt [[illusionism]]: there is no phenomenal consciousness. We *represent* ourselves as having irreducible experiential qualities, but this representation is false. There are no qualia, no "what it's like," no phenomenal properties.

### The Illusionist Claim

Frankish: consciousness involves representing certain mental states as having phenomenal properties when they actually don't. We're systematically mistaken about our own experiences. The "illusion problem" (explaining why we represent ourselves as having qualia) replaces the hard problem.

Dennett calls illusionism "the obvious default theory," comparing consciousness to user illusions in computer interfaces—the brain creates representations "as if" there were phenomenal properties when there aren't.

### The Self-Refutation Objection

The primary objection: even illusions require phenomenology. If it *seems* to you that you have qualia, something is going on—the seeming itself. Keith Frankish acknowledges this: his illusionism posits representational states with certain features (e.g., presenting properties as intrinsic and ineffable). These representational states themselves involve cognitive processes. But is there something it is like to be in these representational states? If yes, P-consciousness returns. If no, we deny the obvious.

The illusionist must say: when you stub your toe, there is no "painfulness" beyond the representation of damage and the functional role of that representation. But this seems to deny what is most immediately known: that pain *hurts*, and that hurting is an experiential quality, not merely functional.

### What Illusionism Gets Right

Before dismissing illusionism, acknowledge what it captures: introspection is fallible, folk psychology concepts may distort what they describe, and the "explanatory gap" might partly reflect how we think about experience rather than experience itself. Frankish's positive proposal—that we represent certain states as having phenomenal properties through a specific cognitive mechanism—deserves engagement. The question is whether this cognitive mechanism itself involves phenomenology.

### Dualist Verdict

Illusionism avoids the hard problem by denying its subject matter. If P-consciousness is what is most directly known—the one thing we cannot coherently doubt—then theories denying it are less plausible than theories accepting it. The Map rejects illusionism as denying the phenomenon to be explained.

The deeper response comes from the [[argument-from-reason]]: even *representing* something as having phenomenal properties requires genuine understanding—grasping *what* is being represented. This understanding itself involves phenomenal consciousness. The illusionist cannot coherently describe what they're denying without presupposing it.

## The Mysterian Caveat {#mysterianism}

Even accepting that P-consciousness is real and irreducible, we face a further question: can we understand *how* it relates to physical processes? [[Mysterianism]] suggests the answer may be no—not because consciousness is supernatural, but because our cognitive architecture may be closed to the relevant property.

Colin McGinn argues we access consciousness through introspection and brains through perception, but neither mode reveals how they connect. Just as rats cannot grasp calculus regardless of intelligence, humans may be unable to grasp property P—whatever makes neural activity feel like something. The solution might exist yet remain forever beyond our conceptual reach.

This connects to [[conceptual-acquisition-limits]]: Jerry Fodor's concept nativism suggests we can only acquire concepts already latent in our cognitive architecture. If the concepts needed to understand consciousness-brain relations aren't among our native endowment, no amount of investigation will produce them.

The mysterian caveat is compatible with both dualism and physicalism—it concerns our epistemic limits, not what reality contains. But it adds humility: the explanatory gap might be permanent, not because physical explanation fails in principle, but because beings like us cannot grasp the relevant connections. The Map takes this seriously under the [[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]] tenet: our sense of which explanations are "simple" may reflect cognitive closure rather than reality.

## Relation to Site Perspective

P-consciousness is central to The Unfinishable Map's [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism tenet]]. The irreducibility of phenomenal properties—the fact that no functional or structural description captures what it is like to see red or feel pain—is the primary reason for rejecting [[materialism]].

### Supporting Dualism

The arguments from P-consciousness converge on dualism:

**The explanatory gap**: Physical descriptions don't entail phenomenal descriptions. We can know all physical facts about vision without knowing what it's like to see red. This gap indicates something about consciousness that physical descriptions cannot capture.

**Zombie conceivability**: The coherence of [[philosophical-zombies|zombies]] shows P-consciousness is logically independent from physical/functional organization. This logical independence suggests metaphysical distinctness.

**Knowledge argument**: [[Knowledge-argument|Mary learns something new]] when she sees red despite knowing all physical facts. Phenomenal facts exceed physical facts.

**Inverted qualia**: Phenomenal character can vary while functional organization remains constant. Therefore phenomenal properties are not identical to functional properties.

Together, these arguments suggest P-consciousness is irreducible—it cannot be explained away, redefined as something functional, or identified with physical properties. If irreducible, consciousness is not purely physical. Dualism follows.

### Bidirectional Interaction

The [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction tenet]] holds that P-consciousness is causally efficacious, not epiphenomenal. The very fact that we report on phenomenal properties—that we discuss what it's like to see red or feel pain—suggests information about P-consciousness flows into the physical domain, influencing speech and behavior.

[[Epiphenomenalism]] (consciousness as causally inert byproduct) faces the self-stultification problem: if phenomenal properties don't affect behavior, our beliefs about phenomenal properties are causally disconnected from the properties themselves. We would believe we have qualia for reasons unrelated to whether we actually do. This makes introspective beliefs unreliable, undermining the epistemic basis for accepting epiphenomenalism in the first place.

If P-consciousness is causally efficacious, it must interface with physical processes. The [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet]] specifies one possible interface: consciousness might influence quantum indeterminacies in neural systems without violating conservation laws. This remains speculative—the Map doesn't commit to a specific mechanism—but some such interface must exist if bidirectional interaction is real.

### The Argument from Reason

The [[argument-from-reason]] provides independent support for P-consciousness's causal efficacy. Rational inference requires tracking normative relationships (what follows from what, what counts as good evidence). But physical causation operates via efficient causes that don't instantiate normativity. If our beliefs were fully explainable by physical causes alone, they couldn't be *rationally justified*—even the belief in physicalism.

P-consciousness enters because only conscious awareness can grasp reasons *as* reasons. An unconscious system might implement reliable truth-tracking (like a thermostat tracking temperature), but it couldn't engage in genuine rational inference—appreciating *why* conclusions follow, recognizing good reasons as good. This "seeing as" requires phenomenal awareness. The argument from reason thus shows P-consciousness is not merely real but causally efficacious in our reasoning.

### Free Will and Agent Causation

P-consciousness's causal efficacy connects directly to [[free-will]]. If phenomenal consciousness influences physical outcomes—if what we experience affects what we do—then we are genuine agents, not mere spectators of our own behavior. The [[agent-causation]] framework makes this explicit: rational deliberation involves a conscious agent weighing reasons and selecting actions, not merely neural processes that happen to correlate with choices.

[[Voluntary-attention|Voluntary attention]] provides a concrete interface: Stapp's [[stapp-quantum-mind|quantum Zeno model]] proposes that conscious attention acts like repeated observation, holding desired neural patterns in place. Whether or not this specific mechanism is correct, the broader point stands: P-consciousness's reality and causal efficacy are preconditions for genuine agency.

### The Access/Phenomenal Distinction and Dualism

Crucially, acknowledging [[access-consciousness]] *strengthens* rather than weakens dualism. By isolating what functional explanations can explain (access mechanisms) from what they cannot (phenomenology), the distinction clarifies the hard problem's scope.

Physicalism can plausibly explain A-consciousness through neural architecture and information integration. What remains inexplicable is P-consciousness—why globally broadcast information feels like anything. The explanatory gap persists even after access is fully explained. This residual gap is where dualism finds its strongest support.

### No Many Worlds

The [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds tenet]] connects to P-consciousness through indexical identity. If many-worlds were true—if every quantum measurement splits reality into branches for each outcome—then "I" would split into multiple instances having different experiences. But P-consciousness is irreducibly first-personal: there is something it is like *for me* to experience this moment. The question "why am I *this* instance rather than another?" seems meaningful, yet many-worlds provides no resources to answer it.

Rejecting many-worlds preserves the singular character of phenomenal experience. When I see red, there is one experience, not infinitely many branch-experiences that merely seem unified. P-consciousness's unity supports real collapse over decoherence-only interpretations.

### Against Illusionism

The Map rejects [[illusionism]] because P-consciousness is what we know most directly. To deny phenomenal properties is to deny the starting point of inquiry: that there is something it is like to be conscious. Philosophical theories should explain consciousness, not explain it away.

### Objectivity and Subjectivity

Thomas Nagel's analysis in [[objectivity-and-consciousness]] illuminates why P-consciousness resists physical explanation. Objective knowledge requires abstracting from particular viewpoints to describe how things are independently of any perspective. But P-consciousness *is* a viewpoint—the subjective perspective itself. To describe consciousness objectively, we would have to abstract away from subjectivity—but subjectivity is precisely what we're trying to understand.

This isn't a failure of current science but a structural tension. The "view from nowhere" that objective description aims for cannot capture the "view from somewhere" that constitutes P-consciousness. Physical descriptions, being objective, necessarily omit phenomenal properties, which are irreducibly perspectival. This suggests the explanatory gap isn't merely epistemic (something we haven't figured out yet) but reflects a genuine ontological distinction between objective physical properties and subjective phenomenal properties.

### PCS and Conceptual Gaps

The [[phenomenal-concepts-strategy]] deserves careful engagement—it's the most sophisticated physicalist response. But Chalmers's master argument suggests PCS relocates rather than solves the problem. Even if we grant that phenomenal concepts have special features, the question remains: why do these features track phenomenal properties rather than merely functional ones? If the features are physically explicable, they can't explain the gap; if they aren't, the gap reappears at the conceptual level.

The Map's position: the explanatory gap reflects a real ontological gap. P-consciousness is irreducible, not merely conceptually independent. Dualism remains the most plausible account.
