Quantum mechanics is our best physical theory, yet physicists fundamentally disagree about what it means. A 2025 Nature survey found that no single interpretation commands majority support. This matters for consciousness studies: different interpretations have radically different implications for whether consciousness plays any role in physics.

The Unfinishable Map explicitly rejects the [[many-worlds|Many-Worlds Interpretation]] (MWI) on five grounds: ontological extravagance, the indexical identity problem, the probability problem, the preferred basis problem, and MWI's failure to explain why consciousness exists at all. But what are the alternatives, and which best aligns with the framework that consciousness participates in physical reality?

## The Measurement Problem

All interpretations respond to the [[measurement-problem|measurement problem]]: quantum systems exist in superposition (multiple states simultaneously) until measured, at which point a single definite outcome appears. What causes this transition? Why do we never observe macroscopic superpositions?

Answers fall into three categories:
1. **Collapse interpretations**: Something real happens at measurement—the wave function collapses
2. **No-collapse interpretations**: The wave function never collapses; apparent collapse is an artifact of our perspective
3. **Epistemic interpretations**: The wave function represents knowledge, not reality; "collapse" is just updating beliefs

## The Major Interpretations

### Copenhagen Interpretation (Baseline)

**Core claims:**
- The wave function represents knowledge about a system, not the system itself
- Measurement causes collapse, but "measurement" is undefined
- Classical apparatus is assumed to exist alongside quantum systems

**Consciousness role:** The original Copenhagen avoided the question by requiring classical measuring apparatus. Von Neumann and Wigner later suggested consciousness might be the collapse trigger, but this isn't standard Copenhagen.

**Site compatibility:** Moderate. Copenhagen's undefined measurement leaves logical space for consciousness, but its instrumentalism conflicts with the Map's realist commitments about consciousness.

### Bohmian Mechanics (Pilot-Wave Theory)

**Core claims:**
- Particles have definite positions at all times, guided by a "pilot wave"
- The wave function evolves unitarily forever—no collapse
- Fully deterministic: apparent randomness reflects ignorance of hidden variables

**Consciousness role:** None. Bohmian mechanics eliminates the observer—outcomes are determined by the pilot wave.

**Site compatibility:** **Low.** Determinism leaves no room for consciousness-caused selection. The [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet would have no work to do.

### QBism (Quantum Bayesianism)

**Core claims:**
- Quantum states represent an agent's subjective beliefs, not objective reality
- Probabilities are Bayesian (subjective), updated upon measurement
- "Collapse" is belief update, not a physical process
- Different agents can consistently assign different states to the same system

**Consciousness role:** Paradoxical. [[qbism|QBism]] makes agents central—only agents have quantum states (beliefs). But it denies wave functions are real, so there's nothing physical for consciousness to collapse. The agent's experience is epistemically fundamental but ontologically unexplained.

**Site compatibility:** Mixed. QBism's agent-centrality echoes the Map's emphasis on conscious subjects, but its anti-realism conflicts with the Map's commitment to real conscious causation. See [[qbism]] for extended analysis.

### Relational Quantum Mechanics

**Core claims:**
- Physical properties exist only relative to observers
- "Observer" means any physical system, not necessarily conscious
- Different observers can consistently attribute different states

**Consciousness role:** None. Rovelli is explicit: "There is nothing subjective, idealistic, or mentalistic, in RQM." Any physical system—a rock, a photon detector, a brain—is equally an "observer."

**Site compatibility:** **Low.** RQM removes consciousness's special role, conflicting with [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]. See [[relational-quantum-mechanics]] for detailed treatment.

### Transactional Interpretation (TI) and Two-State Vector Formalism (TSVF)

These interpretations take seriously the [[time-symmetric-physics|time-symmetry of fundamental physics]]—the fact that equations work equally well forward or backward in time.

**Core claims (TI):**
- Quantum events involve "handshakes" between forward-in-time (retarded) and backward-in-time (advanced) waves
- A "transaction" between emitter and absorber constitutes a measurement
- Time-symmetric: future boundary conditions matter as much as past

**Core claims (TSVF):**
- Complete physical description requires both forward-evolving and backward-evolving quantum states
- Allows "weak values" with unusual properties
- Explicitly retrocausal

**Consciousness role:** Significant. Time-symmetric interpretations allow consciousness to select "which transaction completes" atemporally. Consciousness need not cause collapse *at* a moment—it participates in determining which correlations hold across time.

**Site compatibility:** **High.** These interpretations align closely with the Map's use of [[retrocausality]] to resolve the Libet problem. If consciousness operates atemporally—selecting which temporal history becomes real—then TI/TSVF provide the physics for this "atemporal selection." The [[collapse-and-time]] article already draws on this framework.

### Objective Collapse Theories (GRW, CSL, Penrose)

**Core claims:**
- Wave function collapse is a real physical process occurring spontaneously
- No observer required—collapse happens at a certain rate or threshold
- GRW: spontaneous localization events occur randomly
- CSL: continuous spontaneous localization driven by noise
- Penrose: gravitational self-energy threshold triggers collapse

See [[spontaneous-collapse-theories]] for detailed treatment of these models, including experimental constraints and consciousness-modulated variants. These theories also resolve the [[prebiotic-collapse|prebiotic collapse problem]]—what selected quantum outcomes before conscious observers existed—by providing consciousness-independent baseline collapse.

**Consciousness role (standard):** Low. If collapse happens physically according to GRW/CSL parameters, consciousness doesn't cause it.

**Consciousness role (variants):**
- **Consciousness-integrated CSL** (Kremnizer-Ranchin, Okon-Sebastian): Integrated information (Φ) affects collapse rate. Consciousness modulates collapse rather than causing it.
- **Penrose-Hameroff:** Objective reduction occurs at gravitational threshold, but consciousness is what the reduction *produces*. Collapse constitutes consciousness rather than being caused by it.

**Site compatibility:** Moderate to High. The Map's position is compatible with either "consciousness causes collapse" or "consciousness modulates collapse." What matters is that consciousness participates in determining definite outcomes—whether as cause, modulator, or constitutive process.

## How Interpretations Handle Probability

Each interpretation must account for the Born rule—the squared amplitude giving measurement probabilities. The [[quantum-probability-consciousness]] article examines this in depth.

The key insight: all standard views share a blind spot—they don't address what probability means *for this consciousness*. What does 50% mean for *you* about to measure spin? The first-person perspective is precisely what probability seems to be about, yet appears in none of these accounts.

The Map proposes that Born probabilities describe the objective structure of the consciousness-quantum interface—neither purely subjective beliefs (QBism) nor features independent of consciousness (standard views). Rather, probability reflects the conditions under which consciousness actualises one possibility among many.

## Comparison Table

| Interpretation | Collapse? | Deterministic? | Consciousness Role | Site Alignment |
|---------------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Copenhagen | Yes (undefined) | No | Possible but unclear | Moderate |
| Bohmian | No | Yes | None | Low |
| MWI | No (global) | Yes | None (all outcomes occur) | **Rejected** (five arguments) |
| QBism | Epistemic only | N/A | Agent-centered but anti-realist | Mixed |
| Relational QM | Relational | No | **None** (observer = any physical system) | **Low** |
| **Transactional/TSVF** | Via transaction | No | **Atemporal selection** | **High** |
| GRW/CSL | Physical process | No | None (standard) / Modulation (variants) | Moderate-High |
| Penrose OR | Gravitational | No | Constituted by collapse | Moderate |

## Why the Map Favors Time-Symmetric Interpretations

The transactional interpretation and TSVF align with several site commitments:

### 1. Resolving the Libet Problem

The [[libet-experiments|Libet experiments]] show neural activity precedes conscious awareness of decisions. If causation runs only forward in time, consciousness seems epiphenomenal. But time-symmetric interpretations allow consciousness to select outcomes atemporally—determining which temporal sequence becomes real, including the neural activity that "preceded" the decision.

### 2. Free Will Mechanism

The [[free-will]] article's central proposal—that consciousness selects among quantum possibilities—requires an interpretation where such selection is coherent. Time-symmetric interpretations provide this: consciousness participates in determining which "transaction" completes, which correlations hold across time.

### 3. No Collapse Timing Problem

If consciousness causes collapse at a moment, we face questions about which moment, what triggers it, etc. Time-symmetric interpretations dissolve this: the selection isn't at a moment but determines which moments exist.

## Why the Map Rejects MWI

The [[many-worlds]] article presents five detailed arguments: ontological extravagance, the indexical identity problem, the probability problem, the preferred basis problem, and MWI's failure to explain consciousness.

The deepest conflict: MWI explicitly denies that consciousness plays any role in physics. The [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet holds the opposite. The [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]] tenet encodes this incompatibility.

## Implications for the Map's Framework

The interpretive landscape remains genuinely open. This gives the Map's position—consciousness participates in determining quantum outcomes—legitimate standing. The question is not whether physics rules this out (it doesn't) but which interpretation best explains both quantum phenomena and the existence of consciousness.

Interpretations that eliminate consciousness (Bohmian mechanics, MWI) or treat it as purely epistemic (QBism) don't explain why consciousness exists. The Map's framework takes consciousness as explanatory target, not philosophical afterthought.

## The Illusionist Challenge

[[illusionism|Illusionists]] might argue that quantum interpretation has no bearing on consciousness because consciousness itself is an illusion. But for consciousness to be an illusion, *something* must be under the illusion—the question of its relationship to physical processes remains live.

A subtler objection: even granting phenomenal experience, its physics-relevance doesn't follow. But this objection fails because the interpretive choice *determines* whether consciousness's causal participation is coherent. If MWI is true, there's nowhere for selection to occur—all outcomes happen. If Bohmian mechanics is true, determinism leaves no room. To dismiss interpretations as irrelevant while maintaining epiphenomenalism is to implicitly assume consciousness-excluding interpretations are correct—a substantive commitment, not neutral methodology.

## Process Philosophy Perspective

Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy offers relevant parallels. His "actual occasions"—momentary events with both physical poles (receiving data) and mental poles (contributing novelty)—map onto quantum events: the wave function encodes possibilities, while collapse represents selection of one outcome.

Different interpretations engage this differently: MWI eliminates the mental pole (no selection, only branching); Bohmian mechanics makes it epiphenomenal (positions predetermined); time-symmetric interpretations make it efficacious (consciousness participates in which transactions complete).

Process philosophy coheres most naturally with collapse interpretations: novelty requires genuine selection, experience requires definiteness (one outcome, not all branches), and the mental pole must do actual work.

## Contemplative Evidence

Contemplative traditions provide indirect but relevant data. Across traditions, practitioners report that attention can be voluntarily directed and mental content selected—the phenomenal character of willing, not merely believing in free will. If phenomenology is even approximately accurate, interpretations allowing consciousness-physics interaction accommodate this data better than those that don't.

[[witness-consciousness|Witness consciousness]]—the capacity to observe mental events without identification—maps onto the distinction between quantum systems (in superposition) and observing consciousness (that for which collapse occurs). Time-symmetric interpretations make this mapping apt: the witness participates atemporally in which correlations hold, echoing the reported timelessness of witness states.

Buddhist [[buddhism-and-dualism|anattā]] (no-self) doesn't challenge consciousness-collapse views—it denies a permanent self, not moment-to-moment experience. The "observer" in consciousness-collapse needn't be an enduring self; it can be each moment of experience selecting its own outcome.

## What Would Challenge This View?

The Map's preference for consciousness-inclusive interpretations would face serious difficulties if:

1. **MWI's probability problem is solved convincingly.** If Born rule probabilities can be derived without circularity when all outcomes occur, MWI becomes more viable.

2. **Consciousness-physics interaction is experimentally refuted.** If well-designed experiments consistently found conscious observation produces identical results to unconscious measurement, the consciousness-collapse hypothesis would weaken.

3. **Decoherence timescales prove insurmountable.** If neural decoherence occurs at Tegmark's original timescales (10⁻¹³ seconds) rather than revised estimates (10⁻⁵ seconds), quantum effects relevant to consciousness would be ruled out. Current evidence ([[quantum-coherence-and-binding-evidence|quantum coherence protection]]) suggests revised estimates are more accurate.

4. **A new interpretation emerges that explains consciousness while eliminating selection.** Such an interpretation would challenge the Map by showing consciousness-exclusion needn't mean consciousness-inexplicability.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The choice of quantum interpretation bears directly on all five [[tenets]]:

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]**: Interpretations eliminating consciousness from physics (MWI, Bohmian mechanics) support physicalism; interpretations making consciousness essential to collapse support dualism. Choosing an interpretation is choosing a stance on the mind-body problem.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]**: This tenet requires consciousness to causally influence physical outcomes. MWI and Bohmian mechanics rule this out; RQM eliminates consciousness's special status. Only collapse and time-symmetric interpretations provide mechanisms for bidirectional interaction.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]**: If consciousness affects physics, it does so minimally—at quantum indeterminacies. This is coherent only where indeterminacy is real and selection occurs. Time-symmetric interpretations are especially congenial: consciousness selects which transaction completes—minimal intervention that nonetheless determines outcomes.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]**: The Map rejects MWI on five grounds (see [[many-worlds]]). The core concern: MWI cannot explain why *this* branch is mine. The [[haecceity|haecceitistic]] question—why am I this one?—is meaningful on collapse interpretations and meaningless on MWI.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]**: MWI's "parsimony" values law-simplicity over entity-parsimony. The interpretive landscape's genuine openness (no majority interpretation in 2025) suggests physics hasn't settled what "simple" means here.
