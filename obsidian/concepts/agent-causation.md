Agent causation holds that conscious agents—understood as persisting substances rather than collections of events—directly cause their actions. The agent is the causal source, not reducible to prior mental events like beliefs and desires. This positions agents as initiators of causal chains, not merely links in chains that stretch back before their existence.

this site's [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet is essentially agent-causal: consciousness genuinely selects outcomes. the site's framework specifies *how* this selection occurs—through quantum indeterminacies—while agent-causal philosophy provides the conceptual framework for *what* is happening: substances exercising irreducible causal powers.

## The Distinction: Agent vs. Event Causation

Most causal explanations appeal to events causing events. The cue ball struck the eight ball; the eight ball moved. My desire for coffee caused me to stand; standing caused walking to the kitchen. This is *event causation* or *transeunt causation* (Chisholm's term): events bring about other events through law-governed regularities.

Agent causation—*immanent causation*—is different. The agent, as a persisting substance, directly causes the action. The causation doesn't reduce to prior events in the agent's history. When I decide to raise my hand, it's not that "a decision event" caused "a raising event"; rather, *I* caused the raising. The agent is ontologically prior to the events, not a mere sum of them.

### Why This Matters for Free Will

Event-causal libertarianism (defended by Robert Kane, Mark Balaguer) holds that free actions are caused by mental events—beliefs, desires, intentions—but that these causal processes are nondeterministic. The indeterminism provides openness; the mental event provides causation.

But critics argue this doesn't deliver genuine authorship. If my decision is caused by prior mental events, and I didn't choose those events, how am I the ultimate source? The causal chain still traces back to things outside my control. I'm a conduit for causes, not a source of them.

Significantly, Kane's own position has evolved. His 2024 *The Complex Tapestry of Free Will* explicitly incorporates agent-causal elements, arguing that free action requires agents "exercising teleological guidance control over some of their processes." This represents convergence between event-causal and agent-causal traditions—even defenders of event-causal libertarianism now acknowledge that genuine authorship requires something like agent causation. See [[quantum-indeterminacy-free-will#Event-Causal vs Agent-Causal Approaches|the systematic treatment]] of how this convergence strengthens the libertarian position.

Agent causation answers this challenge. The agent is the source—an "uncaused cause" or "unmoved mover" in the traditional terminology. The regress of causes stops at the agent, who initiates the causal chain through an irreducible capacity to act.

## Major Defenders

### Roderick Chisholm

Chisholm revived agent causation in his 1964 Lindley Lecture, "Human Freedom and the Self." He distinguished transeunt causation (event→event) from immanent causation (agent→event), arguing that free action requires the latter. If we have "the prerogative which some would attribute only to God: each of us, when we act, is a prime mover unmoved."

### Timothy O'Connor

O'Connor's *Persons and Causes* (2000) developed a sophisticated agent-causal account. More recently (2021), he adopted a neo-Aristotelian framework treating *all* causation as fundamentally substance causation—agents exercising causal powers. Event causation becomes derivative: we speak of events causing events, but this is shorthand for substances doing things that bring about other things.

### E.J. Lowe

Lowe's *Personal Agency* (2008) argues that all causation is fundamentally substance causation. "Substances, not events, are the causal source of all change in the world—with rational, free agents having a special place as unmoved movers." On this view, agent causation isn't metaphysically exceptional; it's paradigmatic of causation generally.

### William Hasker

Hasker's "emergent dualism" combines agent causation with an emergentist picture. The soul emerges from brain complexity but is ontologically distinct from it. Unlike Cartesian dualism, the soul has natural origins; unlike materialism, it's irreducible. This supports free will through the unity of consciousness argument: only a genuinely unified agent, not a collection of subsystems, can exercise unified agency.

## The Luck Objection

The central challenge to libertarian free will is the *luck objection*. If indeterminism leaves outcomes undetermined, then nothing about the agent explains which choice occurs. The outcome is lucky or arbitrary—not the agent's doing any more than a determined outcome would be.

Alfred Mele's version: Consider two possible worlds identical up to the moment of decision. In one, the agent chooses A; in the other, B. Nothing about the agent differs between worlds. So what explains the difference? Nothing—it's just luck. But lucky choices aren't free choices.

Agent-causal libertarians respond that the agent *does* explain the difference. In one world, the agent caused A; in the other, the agent caused B. The agent's causing is the explanation. This isn't reducible to prior events (which were identical), but it's not arbitrary—it's the agent exercising causal power.

Critics find this unsatisfying. "The agent caused it" seems to push the explanatory question back rather than answer it. What about the agent explains why they caused A rather than B?

### the site's Response

the site's framework strengthens the agent-causal response. Consciousness doesn't randomly select quantum outcomes—it genuinely *chooses* based on reasons. The selection is neither determined (physics didn't fix the outcome) nor lucky (consciousness selected based on what matters to it).

The [[luck-objection|luck objection article]] develops this response across four dimensions:

1. **Selection vs randomness**: Lucky indeterminism involves passive reception of random outcomes; consciousness-selected indeterminism involves active choosing. The relationship to indeterminacy is fundamentally different.

2. **Phenomenology of effort**: Random processes don't feel like anything in particular—certainly not like work. But choosing feels effortful. The [[mental-effort|phenomenology of effort]]—sustained attention requiring ongoing engagement—distinguishes selection from luck. Lucky events don't feel like achievements; selections do.

3. **Reasons-guided selection**: Consciousness selects based on reasons—the same reasons that make actions intelligible. Why A rather than B? Because the agent had reasons for A. This makes selection contrastively explicable, unlike pure chance.

4. **Retrocausal deepening**: If [[retrocausality|selection is atemporal]]—determining which temporal history becomes real—then asking "what about the prior state explains the choice?" misframes the situation. The prior state is part of what consciousness selected.

This differs from the standard agent-causal response ("the agent caused it") by specifying *how* the agent's causation is non-arbitrary. The agent selects based on reasons, with phenomenal engagement, at quantum indeterminacies. The explanatory buck stops at the agent's exercise of causal power—but that exercise is reasons-responsive, not random.

### Where Explanation Terminates

Critics press further: but what explains why consciousness selected A rather than B? The [[quantum-indeterminacy-free-will#Where Explanation Terminates|agent-causal response]]: the agent's exercise of causal power is itself the explanation. Just as physics doesn't explain why the universe exists (taking existence as primitive), agent causation takes the agent's power to select as primitive.

This isn't evasion. Explanation must terminate somewhere. "The agent selected for reasons" is a legitimate terminus—more satisfying than "it randomly happened." The agent is the source because agents are the kind of thing that can be sources. the site's framework strengthens this by showing that selection is phenomenologically distinct from lucky reception (effort vs passivity), neurally distinct (frontal theta signatures), and reasons-responsive rather than arbitrary.

## Substance Causation and the site's Framework

Lowe and O'Connor's substance causation view has profound implications. If all causation is fundamentally substances exercising powers, then consciousness causing physical events isn't metaphysically exceptional—it's how causation works generally.

This reframes the [[interactionist-dualism#The Causal Closure Argument|causal closure objection]]. The objection assumes event causation is fundamental: every physical event must have a prior physical event cause. But if substance causation is fundamental, this assumption fails. Physics describes regularities in what substances do; it doesn't prove substances are exclusively physical.

the site's quantum mechanism specifies *where* agent causation interfaces with physics: at quantum indeterminacies, where physics leaves outcomes undetermined. The agent—the conscious substance—selects among quantum possibilities. This isn't consciousness "adding" to physical causation; it's consciousness exercising the same kind of causal power that all substances exercise, at points where physics doesn't determine the outcome.

This framework also addresses the [[pairing-problem|pairing problem]]—what connects *this* mind to *this* body? If consciousness interfaces with physics at specific quantum-sensitive neural structures, consciousness is spatially located where those structures are. The mind is paired with the body it causally affects. Agent causation doesn't float freely; it operates through particular physical interfaces.

### The Decoherence Challenge

The main physics-based objection: warm neural tissue decoheres quantum superpositions in ~10^-13 seconds (Tegmark 2000), far too fast for the 300ms attention deployment to exploit. But this calculation assumes quantum effects must persist at scales comparable to neural computation. the site's mechanism requires only that consciousness biases which quantum outcome actualizes at the moment of decoherence—not that coherence persists for macroscopic durations. Additionally, quantum biology has revealed coherence effects in warm biological systems (avian magnetoreception, photosynthetic energy transfer) that Tegmark's original calculations ruled out, suggesting the decoherence timescales may be revisable. See [[decoherence]] for the fuller engagement.

## Agent Causation and Sourcehood

Robert Kane emphasizes *sourcehood* as the core requirement for free will: the agent must be the ultimate source of their actions, not merely a link in causal chains originating elsewhere. This condition is satisfied if the agent is an "uncaused cause"—but event-causal libertarianism struggles to provide this.

Agent causation provides sourcehood directly. The agent is the source because the agent, as substance, initiates the causal chain. Prior events influence but don't determine; the agent determines by exercising irreducible causal power.

the site's framework satisfies both of Kane's conditions for free will:
- **Sourcehood**: Consciousness is the ultimate source because it selects which quantum outcome becomes actual
- **Alternative possibilities**: Multiple outcomes were genuinely possible until selection occurred

The retrocausal dimension (see [[retrocausality]]) adds depth. If consciousness's selection is atemporal—if it determines which temporal history becomes real—then the agent is even more radically the source. Not just "the first cause in this chain" but "the cause of there being this chain at all."

## Skill Delegation and the Interface

A challenge for agent causation: if the agent causes actions, why don't agents consciously control every detail of skilled performance? When I type this sentence, I don't select each keystroke; my fingers "know" where to go. Does this automaticity undermine agent causation?

The [[implicit-memory|implicit memory]] framework resolves this tension. Tulving's Dreyfus model charts how consciousness relates to procedural skills across development. Novices consciously follow explicit rules; experts act fluidly without deliberation. But this progression represents *delegation*, not *absence*. Consciousness trains the procedural system, then withdraws from moment-to-moment execution while retaining override capacity.

### The Choking Phenomenon as Evidence

The "choking under pressure" phenomenon provides striking support for agent causation. When skilled performers consciously attend to automatized actions, performance degrades. The expert golfer thinking about their swing, the concert pianist monitoring finger placement—both perform worse than when acting unreflectively.

This degradation proves consciousness isn't epiphenomenal. If attention were causally inert, attending to skills couldn't interfere with them. The fact that conscious engagement *disrupts* procedural execution demonstrates causal efficacy—precisely what agent causation claims. Consciousness doesn't merely observe action; it can intervene, sometimes unhelpfully.

The illusionist might respond: felt effort is itself illusory—there's neural competition but no phenomenal causation. But this response faces the self-stultification problem: if phenomenal effort is illusory, the illusionist's argument about effort doesn't track anything real. The very discussion of effort becomes accidentally correlated with its subject matter. Choking provides non-verbal behavioural evidence: skilled performance degrades when attention is deployed, regardless of how we conceptualize the phenomenology.

### Anoetic Consciousness and Continuous Subjecthood

Crucially, even during automatic performance, the agent persists. Tulving associated implicit memory with *anoetic consciousness*: experiential but non-reflective. There remains something it is like to perform a well-practiced skill; the mode is simply different from self-aware deliberation.

This matters for agent causation's metaphysics. The agent—the substance exercising causal powers—continues throughout skilled performance, maintaining the embodied engagement that expert action requires. Automaticity isn't the absence of the agent but a mode of the agent's engagement: consciousness having calibrated the system well enough that moment-to-moment selection becomes unnecessary.

The agent remains the source. They trained the skill, they sustain the embodied context within which it executes, and they retain the capacity to re-engage—as choking demonstrates. Delegation presupposes a delegator.

## Voluntary Attention as Agent-Causal Paradigm

If agent causation is real, we should find its clearest expression in cases where consciousness initiates action without external prompting. [[attention-as-interface|Voluntary attention]]—choosing where to direct awareness—provides exactly this paradigm case. Recent neuroscience distinguishes "willed attention" (internally chosen) from "instructed attention" (externally cued), finding distinct neural signatures for genuine decision-making.

### The Temporal Signature of Choosing

Endogenous (voluntary) attention takes approximately 300ms to deploy fully, compared to 100ms for exogenous (automatic) capture. This slower deployment time isn't inefficiency—it reflects decision processes. The additional 200ms corresponds to frontal theta oscillations (~500ms post-cue) that mark genuine choosing rather than reflexive response.

Crucially, voluntary attention can be sustained at will. Exogenous capture is transient, generating "inhibition of return" after ~300ms—the brain actively suppresses the captured location. But willed attention maintains focus as long as the agent continues engaging. This sustained character matches what agent causation predicts: the agent actively maintains the causal engagement.

### Neural Signatures of Willing

Research reveals three neural components specific to willed attention, with clear contrasts to instructed behaviour:

| Feature | Willed Attention | Instructed Attention |
|---------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Frontal theta** | Increased (~500ms post-cue) | Lower |
| **Frontoparietal coherence** | Bidirectional information flow | More unidirectional |
| **Decision processes** | Additional frontal engagement | Standard top-down control |

These findings converge on a key point: the brain distinguishes between doing what you're told and doing what you choose. The neural signature of genuine choosing is real and measurable.

Additionally:

1. **Frontal theta oscillations**: When participants choose where to attend (rather than following instructions), frontal theta power increases—marking the decision process itself
2. **Bidirectional frontoparietal coherence**: Information flows both ways between frontal executive regions and parietal attention control areas during willed attention, consistent with genuine feedback rather than one-way command
3. **Pre-prompt alpha states**: Ongoing neural activity predicts subsequent free choices, raising the question of whether "choice" is merely post-hoc rationalization

The third finding parallels the [[libet-experiments|Libet experiments]]: if neural states predict choices before awareness, where is the agent?

### The Selection-Among-Options Resolution

the site's framework accommodates predictive neural states through the selection-among-options model. Pre-prompt alpha activity doesn't generate choices from nothing—it establishes the options available for selection. Stochastic neural fluctuations create a menu; consciousness selects from that menu.

This differs from both:
- **Libertarian ex nihilo**: Choice created from nothing (vulnerable to luck objection)
- **Deterministic reduction**: Choice as inevitable outcome of prior states

Instead: prior neural states constrain possibilities; consciousness selects among real alternatives. The agent is source of the selection even if not source of the options.

The 300ms deployment time becomes interpretable: consciousness needs that duration to engage with the prepared options and make selection effective. This matches Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism, where sustained observation influences outcome probabilities—observation that takes time to have causal effect.

### The Phenomenology of Directing vs Being Captured

First-person experience distinguishes willed from captured attention. When a loud noise draws attention, there's a sense of being *pulled*—you didn't do it, it happened to you. When you choose to focus on a difficult text, you experience *directing*—active engagement that feels like it originates from you.

This phenomenological distinction maps onto the neural distinction between ventral (capture) and dorsal (voluntary) attention networks. The experience of agency corresponds to actual mechanistic differences in how attention is deployed. Agent causation predicts exactly this: there should be phenomenological markers of genuine agency that correspond to real causal differences.

## Motor Selection: The Second Domain

The [[motor-selection|motor selection]] evidence extends agent causation beyond attention to motor control—and the parallel is striking. Motor control shows the same neural signatures of willed action:

| Feature | Willed Attention | Willed Movement |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Frontal theta** | Increased (~500ms post-cue) | Increased |
| **Deployment time** | ~300ms | ~300ms |
| **Frontoparietal coherence** | Bidirectional | Bidirectional |
| **Phenomenology** | Feels effortful | Feels effortful |

This parallel is unlikely to be coincidental. Attention and motor control are distinct domains—selecting what to perceive versus selecting what to do—yet they show identical neural signatures of genuine choice. If the agent-causal framework applies to attention, it applies to motor control for the same reasons. If it were an artifact or illusion in one domain, the convergence across domains would be inexplicable.

### Why Two Domains Strengthen the Case

The single-domain objection: perhaps attention's distinctive signatures reflect something peculiar about attention, not about consciousness exercising causal power. Maybe frontal theta marks "internal generation" rather than "genuine agency."

Two domains answer this. Motor selection involves different brain regions, different output pathways, different evolutionary pressures—yet the same signatures appear. The basal ganglia brake-release mechanism operates separately from thalamic gating for attention, yet both show:
- Selection among competing options
- ~300ms decision timeline
- Bidirectional information flow during willed action
- Phenomenology of effort and authorship

This convergence supports the agent-causal interpretation: consciousness exercises the same causal power across multiple domains. The mechanism is domain-general, not an artifact of attention-specific processing.

### The Libet Challenge Dissolves

The motor domain traditionally posed the greatest challenge to agent causation through Libet's experiments—the brain "decides" before we're aware. But this challenge has substantially weakened:

1. **Schurger's reinterpretation**: The readiness potential may be noise artifact, not decision signature
2. **Surgical evidence**: Sjöberg (2024) shows SMA resection doesn't impair voluntary action—the RP wasn't tracking volition
3. **Desmurget's dissociation**: Intention (parietal) is neurally separate from execution (premotor)—consciousness contributes at selection, not execution

Motor control no longer challenges agent causation; it supports it. The ~300ms timeline for willed movement matches willed attention because both reflect the same selection mechanism.

### Agent Causation Naturalized

The voluntary attention and motor selection literature provides something agent-causal philosophy traditionally lacked: naturalistic mechanism. Rather than positing "irreducible substance causation" as primitive, we can identify:

- **Where**: Frontal cortex decision regions, with thalamus as relay between top-down and bottom-up signals
- **When**: The 300ms deployment window and sustained engagement period
- **How**: Theta oscillations mediating frontoparietal communication
- **Why effortful**: Sustained engagement requires continuous activity maintenance

This doesn't reduce consciousness to neural activity—the hard problem remains. But it shows how agent causation integrates with rather than floats above neuroscience. The agent acts *through* attention networks, leaving distinctive signatures of genuine decision-making.

## Creative Generation: Beyond Pure Selection

Agent causation as traditionally conceived focuses on selection: the agent chooses among options. But recent work on [[consciousness-and-creativity|consciousness and creativity]] reveals a deeper contribution—agents don't merely select from pre-existing menus but actively generate the options themselves.

### The Generation-Selection Synthesis

The creativity literature (Bergson, Boden, contemporary neuroscience) identifies two modes of conscious contribution:

1. **Generation**: Imagination explores possibility space, constituting options that didn't exist before the exploration
2. **Selection**: Attention actualizes specific possibilities from what imagination generated

These aren't sequential but interweaving aspects of a single creative process. Each imaginative move shapes what further possibilities become available; attending to one option opens some paths and closes others. The agent generates *through* the act of exploring and selecting.

This synthesis strengthens agent causation. Critics ask: "What about the agent explains why they caused A rather than B?" If agents only select from externally provided options, the question bites hard—nothing about the selector explains which option was selected.

But if agents generate the options through imaginative exploration, the answer changes. The agent explains the outcome because the agent constituted the very options that were available. The "menu" wasn't pre-set by physics or brain processes alone—consciousness's imaginative engagement shaped what was on the menu.

### L-Creativity and Sourcehood

Carl Hausman's concept of *L-creativity* (libertarian creativity) requires "metaphysical novelty"—what genuinely didn't exist before, not merely what the creator hadn't considered. This maps directly onto the sourcehood requirement for free will. An agent is source of their action in the robust sense if they produce something that wasn't inevitable from prior conditions.

The quantum framework provides the opening. At indeterminacies, physics doesn't determine outcomes—multiple possibilities are genuinely real until selection occurs. When consciousness engages imaginatively with these possibilities, it doesn't passively receive them but actively explores, expanding which possibilities become concrete enough to select among.

### Where Creative Sourcehood Operates

Bergson's insight illuminates the mechanism: lived [[duration]] is "invention or it is nothing at all." Each moment of conscious experience brings genuine novelty through memory's progressive integration with the present. The options available now differ from those available a moment ago because the agent's conscious engagement continuously reshapes possibility space.

This gives agent causation temporal depth. The agent isn't source just at the moment of choice but throughout the creative process that makes choice meaningful. Training skills, developing character, engaging with problems—all these shape what options become available for selection. The 300ms deployment window for willed attention isn't when agency begins; it's when agency culminates in specific actualization.

Margaret Boden's "transformational creativity"—producing what was "downright impossible" within the previous framework—provides the clearest case. You cannot select a rule-change from within the old rule-system; the agent must both generate the new rules and recognize their value. This is agent causation in its strongest form: the agent as source of the very framework within which selection occurs.

### Process Philosophy and Actual Occasions

Whitehead's process philosophy offers a complementary perspective. His "actual occasions"—momentary experiential events—exercise what Whitehead called "self-determination" in constituting themselves from their causal inheritance. Each occasion prehends (grasps) its predecessors and creatively synthesizes something new. This isn't substance causation in the Aristotelian sense but a different metaphysical picture where causation is inherently experiential and creative.

The process view illuminates agent causation from an unexpected direction. If all causation involves experiential self-determination (panexperientialism), then human agent causation is continuous with causation generally rather than metaphysically exceptional. Consciousness doesn't mysteriously intervene in physical causation—it exemplifies what causation fundamentally is. This weakens the objection that agent causation is ad hoc while preserving its core insight: genuine novelty enters the world through experiential synthesis.

## What Would Challenge This View?

Agent causation is falsifiable. Findings that would undermine the framework:

**Complete neural prediction**: If all decisions could be predicted from prior brain states with 100% accuracy, at timescales ruling out quantum effects, there would be no "gap" for consciousness to fill. Current predictive accuracy (~60% for simple choices) leaves substantial room.

**Elimination of quantum effects in neural tissue**: If quantum coherence were proven physically impossible in brain tissue—not just challenging but excluded—the proposed interface mechanism fails. Current evidence from quantum biology (avian magnetoreception, enzyme catalysis, photosynthesis) suggests biological quantum effects are more robust than expected.

**Dissociation of effort and outcome**: If sustained mental effort could be shown to have no correlation with decision outcomes—feeling hard when choices are actually easy, feeling easy when choices are actually hard—the phenomenological support collapses. Current evidence shows the opposite: difficult decisions feel effortful and engage distinctive neural signatures.

**No willed/instructed distinction**: If the neural signatures for willed and instructed attention turned out to be identical, the claim that consciousness adds something beyond physical prompts would weaken significantly. Current research robustly distinguishes the two.

**Solving the hard problem materialistically**: If a compelling account of why physical processes give rise to subjective experience emerged, the motivation for treating consciousness as a separate causal factor would diminish. The explanatory gap has persisted despite decades of materialist effort.

**Many-worlds empirical confirmation**: If the [[many-worlds|many-worlds interpretation]] were empirically confirmed (though how this could occur is unclear), there would be no collapse for consciousness to influence—all outcomes occur in branching universes. the site's rejection of MWI is foundational to the agent-causal picture.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Agent causation is the philosophical tradition to which this site belongs. The [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet—that consciousness causally influences the physical world—is a claim of agent causation: the conscious subject, as substance, causes physical events.

What the site adds is mechanism. Traditional agent causation lacked an account of *where* or *how* the agent interfaces with the physical world. The [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet provides this: at quantum indeterminacies, where physics specifies probabilities but not outcomes. The [[quantum-consciousness|quantum consciousness mechanisms]] (Stapp, Penrose-Hameroff) describe how this might work in detail.

The [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]] tenet is also essential. Agent causation requires the agent to be ontologically distinct from physical events—otherwise, "agent causation" collapses into event causation. Substance dualism provides this: consciousness is a substance that exercises causal powers, not a property of physical substances. Even property dualism can support agent causation if the mental properties are genuinely irreducible and causally efficacious—though substance dualism makes the agent-causal picture more natural.

The [[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]] tenet addresses the main objection to agent causation: that it's metaphysically extravagant, positing a primitive relation unlike anything else in nature. But if we take consciousness seriously—if the hard problem is genuine—then consciousness already requires something beyond standard physics. Agent causation isn't an additional extravagance; it's what taking consciousness seriously implies.
