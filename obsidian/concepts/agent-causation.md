Agent causation holds that conscious agents—understood as persisting substances rather than collections of events—directly cause their actions. The agent is the causal source, not reducible to prior mental events like beliefs and desires. This positions agents as initiators of causal chains, not merely links in chains that stretch back before their existence.

The Unfinishable Map's [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet is essentially agent-causal: consciousness genuinely selects outcomes. The Map's framework specifies *how* this selection occurs—through quantum indeterminacies—while agent-causal philosophy provides the conceptual framework for *what* is happening: substances exercising irreducible causal powers.

## The Distinction: Agent vs. Event Causation

Most causal explanations appeal to events causing events—*transeunt causation* in Chisholm's term. Agent causation (*immanent causation*) is different: the agent, as a persisting substance, directly causes the action. When I decide to raise my hand, *I* caused the raising—the agent is ontologically prior to events, not a mere sum of them.

### Why This Matters for Free Will

Event-causal libertarianism holds that free actions are caused by nondeterministic mental events. But critics argue this doesn't deliver genuine authorship: if prior mental events cause my decision, and I didn't choose those events, the causal chain traces back beyond my control.

Agent causation answers this. The agent is the source—an "uncaused cause" in traditional terminology. The regress stops at the agent's irreducible capacity to act. Kane's 2024 work now incorporates agent-causal elements, representing convergence between traditions. See [[quantum-indeterminacy-free-will#Event-Causal vs Agent-Causal Approaches|the systematic treatment]].

## The Metaphysical Foundation: Substance Causation

Agent causation rests on a deeper metaphysical thesis: *substance causation*—the view that substances (persisting things with causal powers) are the fundamental causal agents in the world, and events are what substances *do*, not independent causal relata. Developed most thoroughly by E.J. Lowe with roots in Aristotelian and Thomistic philosophy, substance causation reframes the mind-body problem. If all causation is fundamentally substance causation, then consciousness causing physical events is paradigmatic of what causation is.

### Event Causation vs. Substance Causation

The dominant view in contemporary philosophy is *event causation*: events cause events according to laws. The firing of neuron A causes the firing of neuron B. Your desire (an event) causes your action (another event).

Substance causation inverts this. Substances—the neuron, you—are the causal agents. When neuron A fires, the neuron exercises its powers; it isn't that "the firing" causes something. When you act, *you* cause the action—not your desire causing your body to move. Lowe put it directly: "Substances, not events, are the causal source of all change in the world."

Can event causation reduce to substance causation, or vice versa? Lowe argued that event causation reduces to substance causation: "A caused B" really means "some substance exercised powers that brought about B." The reverse reduction fails—you can't analyse "substance S exercised power P" purely in terms of events without presupposing S itself. Substances are ontologically prior.

This matters for [[mental-causation|mental causation]]. If event causation is fundamental, Kim's exclusion argument has force: mental events compete with physical events for causal responsibility. If substance causation is fundamental, the question shifts: what substances exist and what powers do they have?

### Lowe's Framework

E.J. Lowe developed the most systematic contemporary defence of substance causation in *Personal Agency* (2008). Key elements:

**Four-category ontology**: Lowe distinguishes substances (individual things), kinds (categories substances belong to), modes (particular property instances), and attributes (universal properties). Causation operates primarily at the substance level.

**Powers and liabilities**: Substances have causal powers (capacities to produce effects) and liabilities (susceptibilities to be affected). A match has the power to ignite; wood has the liability to burn. Causation occurs when powers meet liabilities.

**Free agents as unmoved movers**: Free agents are "unmoved movers, or initiators of new causal chains." When you make a choice, *you* initiate the causal chain—there's no prior event that determines your choice.

**Volitions as uncaused by events**: Volitions (acts of will) have no *event-cause*—no prior event determines them—but they do have an *agent-cause*: the agent produces them directly. "Uncaused" means uncaused by events, not uncaused simpliciter.

### Why Substance Causation Matters for Consciousness

The standard objection to [[interactionist-dualism|interactionist dualism]] is that consciousness causing physical events would be "metaphysically exceptional"—a mysterious relation unlike ordinary causation. If ordinary causation is event→event following laws, then consciousness→neurons seems anomalous.

Substance causation dissolves this objection. If *all* causation is substances exercising powers, then consciousness causing events is the same *type* of causation as anything else. The rock breaks the window because the rock exercises powers; consciousness affects neurons because consciousness exercises powers. Same metaphysical structure.

This doesn't prove consciousness causes anything—that's an empirical and phenomenological question. But it removes the objection that consciousness *couldn't* cause anything because that would require a fundamentally new kind of causation.

### The Causal Closure Question

Kim's exclusion argument against [[mental-causation|mental causation]] depends on [[causal-closure|causal closure]]: every physical event has a sufficient physical cause. If true, mental causes seem excluded.

Substance causation shifts the dialectic. The question isn't whether physical *events* are sufficient but whether physical *substances* are the only substances with causal powers. Physics describes regularities in what substances do; it doesn't prove that only physical substances exist.

The Map's quantum framework strengthens this response. At quantum indeterminacies, physics specifies probabilities but not outcomes—there's no sufficient physical cause because physics is genuinely incomplete there. The exclusion argument fails because its key premise fails: physical events *don't* have sufficient physical causes at quantum measurement.

### Challenges to Substance Causation

**The laws problem**: If substances cause events by exercising powers, what role do laws play? Lowe's response: laws describe what substances of certain kinds tend to do given their powers and liabilities. They're *descriptive* of substance activity, not *productive* of it. Critics worry this makes the regularity of substance behaviour unexplained.

**The agent problem**: What about the agent explains *which* action occurs? This is the [[luck-objection|luck objection]] applied to substance causation—addressed in the section on the luck objection.

**The [[pairing-problem|pairing problem]]**: If consciousness is a non-physical substance, how does it connect to *this* particular body? Combined with the Map's interface locality principle, substance causation can answer: consciousness is spatially located where it causally interfaces with the brain.

## Major Defenders

Key figures: **Reid** (1788) is the founding figure, arguing that active power belongs to agents, not events. **Chisholm** (1964) revived agent causation, distinguishing immanent from transeunt causation. **O'Connor** (2000, 2021) developed substance causation where all causation is fundamentally agents exercising powers. **Lowe** (2008) argued substances, not events, are the causal source of all change—agent causation isn't exceptional but paradigmatic. **Hasker** combines agent causation with emergent dualism: the soul emerges from brain complexity but remains ontologically distinct. **Jacobs and O'Connor** (2013) develop the connection explicitly in a neo-Aristotelian framework, treating all causation as substance causation.

## The Luck Objection

The central challenge: if indeterminism leaves outcomes undetermined, nothing about the agent explains which choice occurs. Mele's version: in two identical worlds where the agent chooses differently, what explains the difference? Nothing—it's luck.

Agent-causal libertarians respond that the agent *does* explain the difference through exercising causal power. Critics find this unsatisfying: what about the agent explains why A rather than B?

### The Map's Response

The Map strengthens this response. Consciousness doesn't randomly select—it genuinely *chooses* based on reasons. The [[luck-objection|luck objection article]] develops the full response:

1. **Selection vs randomness**: Active choosing differs fundamentally from passive reception of random outcomes
2. **Phenomenology of effort**: Choosing feels effortful; lucky events don't feel like achievements (see [[mental-effort]], [[phenomenology-of-choice]])
3. **Reasons-guided selection**: Consciousness selects based on reasons, making selection contrastively explicable
4. **Retrocausal deepening**: If [[retrocausality|selection is atemporal]], the prior state is part of what consciousness selected

The agent's exercise of causal power is itself the explanation—a legitimate terminus, like physics taking existence as primitive. Selection is phenomenologically distinct (effort vs passivity), neurally distinct (frontal theta), and reasons-responsive. The [[authentic-vs-inauthentic-choice|authenticity dimension]] matters here: agent causation is fully engaged in authentic choice (where you genuinely author the decision) and attenuated in inauthentic, scripted behavior—suggesting the selection function has variable engagement rather than operating uniformly across all actions.

## The Map's Framework: Where Agent Causation Interfaces with Physics

The Map specifies *where* agent causation interfaces with physics: at quantum indeterminacies, where physics leaves outcomes undetermined. The agent selects among quantum possibilities—exercising the same kind of causal power that all substances exercise. This reframes the [[interactionist-dualism#The Causal Closure Argument|causal closure objection]]: physics describes regularities in what substances do; it doesn't prove substances are exclusively physical.

This also addresses the [[pairing-problem|pairing problem]]: if consciousness interfaces at specific quantum-sensitive neural structures, it's spatially located where those structures are. Agent causation operates through particular physical interfaces.

Why can't we observe this interface in action? The [[causal-interface|causal interface void]] explains: the mechanism is systematically invisible from both first-person introspection (which accesses intentions and actions but not their connection) and third-person observation (which sees correlates but not causation). This opacity is *predicted* by minimal quantum interaction—a minimal influence leaves minimal traces. The invisibility is not an embarrassment but a consequence of the interface being precisely small enough to avoid violating conservation laws.

The [[decoherence|decoherence challenge]]—that warm neural tissue decoheres too fast—assumes quantum effects must persist at computation timescales. The Map requires only that consciousness biases outcomes *at* decoherence, and quantum biology has revealed unexpected coherence in warm biological systems.

## Agent Causation and Sourcehood

Kane emphasizes *sourcehood*: the agent must be the ultimate source, not merely a link in causal chains. Agent causation provides this directly—the agent initiates the causal chain through irreducible power.

The Map satisfies both conditions for free will:
- **Sourcehood**: Consciousness selects which quantum outcome becomes actual
- **Alternative possibilities**: Multiple outcomes were genuinely possible until selection

The [[retrocausality|retrocausal dimension]] deepens this: if selection is atemporal, determining which temporal history becomes real, the agent is "the cause of there being this chain at all." The [[time-consciousness-growing-block|Time, Consciousness, and the Growing Block]] apex synthesis develops the full implications: agents don't just act *within* time—they participate in time's constitution. If collapse creates temporal direction, and consciousness participates in collapse, then agent causation becomes participation in creating the temporal structure within which actions unfold.

## Skill Delegation and the Interface

If agents cause actions, why don't they control every detail of skilled performance? The [[implicit-memory|implicit memory]] framework resolves this: skilled automaticity represents *delegation*, not absence. Consciousness trains procedural systems, then withdraws while retaining override capacity.

The "choking under pressure" phenomenon demonstrates causal efficacy. When experts consciously attend to automatized actions, performance degrades—proving consciousness isn't epiphenomenal. If attention were causally inert, it couldn't interfere with skills.

Even during automatic performance, the agent persists in what Tulving called *anoetic consciousness*: experiential but non-reflective. The agent trained the skill, sustains the embodied context, and retains re-engagement capacity. Delegation presupposes a delegator.

## Voluntary Attention as Agent-Causal Paradigm

[[attention-as-interface|Voluntary attention]]—choosing where to direct awareness—provides the paradigm case of agent causation. Neuroscience distinguishes "willed attention" (internally chosen) from "instructed attention" (externally cued), finding distinct neural signatures. The [[attentional-economics|attentional economics]] framework extends this: agency operates through the ongoing allocation of a finite attentional resource, making freedom scale with attentional skill.

Endogenous attention takes ~300ms to deploy versus 100ms for automatic capture, with increased frontal theta and bidirectional frontoparietal coherence. The brain distinguishes between doing what you're told and doing what you choose.

Pre-prompt neural activity predicts free choices, paralleling the [[libet-experiments|Libet experiments]]. The Map's resolution: prior activity establishes *options* for selection; consciousness selects from that menu. The agent is source of selection even if not source of options.

First-person experience confirms the distinction: being *pulled* by a loud noise versus *directing* attention to difficult text. This phenomenological marker maps onto real mechanistic differences between ventral (capture) and dorsal (voluntary) networks. See [[phenomenology-of-choice]] for the full arc from deliberation through decision to authorship.

## Motor Selection: The Second Domain

[[motor-selection|Motor selection]] extends agent causation beyond attention, showing striking parallels: willed movement displays the same ~300ms timeline, frontal theta increase, bidirectional coherence, and phenomenology of effort as willed attention.

This convergence across distinct domains—different brain regions, output pathways, evolutionary pressures—answers the single-domain objection. If agent-causal signatures were artifacts of attention-specific processing, they wouldn't appear identically in motor control.

The Libet challenge has also substantially weakened. Schurger's reinterpretation treats the readiness potential as noise artifact; Sjöberg (2024) shows SMA resection doesn't impair voluntary action; Desmurget dissociates intention (parietal) from execution (premotor). Motor control now supports agent causation rather than challenging it.

This literature provides what agent-causal philosophy traditionally lacked: naturalistic mechanism—identifying where (frontal cortex), when (300ms window), and how (theta oscillations) agents act through neural networks, without reducing consciousness to neural activity.

## Creative Generation: Beyond Pure Selection

Agent causation traditionally focuses on selection, but [[consciousness-and-creativity|recent work]] reveals agents also *generate* options through imaginative exploration. Generation and selection interweave: each imaginative move shapes available possibilities; attending to one option opens some paths and closes others.

This strengthens agent causation against the critic who asks what about the agent explains the choice. If agents generate the options through imagination, the agent explains the outcome because they constituted the very options available.

Hausman's *L-creativity* requires "metaphysical novelty"—what genuinely didn't exist before—mapping directly onto sourcehood. Bergson's [[duration]] develops this: conscious experience brings genuine novelty through memory's integration with the present. The agent isn't source just at choice but throughout the creative process.

Whitehead's [[process-philosophy|process philosophy]] offers complementary support: if all causation involves experiential self-determination, human agent causation is continuous with causation generally rather than metaphysically exceptional. This reframes the objection: the question is not "How can consciousness possibly cause anything?" but "Why did we think it couldn't?" The [[process-and-consciousness|Process and Consciousness]] apex develops this connection in depth.

## What Would Challenge This View?

Agent causation is falsifiable. Key challenges:

- **Complete neural prediction**: 100% accuracy predicting decisions from prior brain states would leave no gap. Current prediction accuracy remains well below this threshold, leaving substantial room for consciousness-selection.
- **Elimination of neural quantum effects**: If quantum coherence were excluded in brain tissue, the interface mechanism fails. Quantum biology suggests effects are more robust than expected.
- **Dissociation of effort and outcome**: If effort didn't correlate with decision difficulty, phenomenological support collapses. Current evidence shows correlation.
- **No willed/instructed distinction**: If neural signatures were identical, the claim consciousness adds something would weaken. Research robustly distinguishes them.
- **Solving the hard problem materialistically**: A compelling materialist account of subjective experience would reduce motivation for treating consciousness as separate causal factor.
- **[[concepts/many-worlds|Many-worlds]] confirmation**: If MWI were empirically confirmed, there would be no collapse to influence—all outcomes occur in branching universes.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Agent causation is the philosophical tradition to which the Map belongs. The [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet—that consciousness causally influences the physical world—is a claim of agent causation: the conscious subject, as substance, causes physical events.

What the Map adds is mechanism. Traditional agent causation lacked an account of *where* or *how* the agent interfaces with the physical world. The [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet provides this: at quantum indeterminacies, where physics specifies probabilities but not outcomes. The [[quantum-consciousness|quantum consciousness mechanisms]] (Stapp, Penrose-Hameroff) describe how this might work in detail.

The [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]] tenet is also essential. Agent causation requires the agent to be ontologically distinct from physical events—otherwise, "agent causation" collapses into event causation. Substance dualism provides this: consciousness is a substance that exercises causal powers, not a property of physical substances. Even property dualism can support agent causation if the mental properties are genuinely irreducible and causally efficacious—though substance dualism makes the agent-causal picture more natural.

The [[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]] tenet addresses the main objection to agent causation: that it's metaphysically extravagant, positing a primitive relation unlike anything else in nature. But substance causation answers this directly: if all causation is substances exercising powers, then agent causation posits fewer primitive relations than event causation, which needs events, laws, and the mysterious relation between them. The apparent simplicity of event causation may mask unresolved problems about what laws *do*. Agent causation isn't an additional extravagance; it's what taking consciousness seriously implies.

Against [[concepts/epiphenomenalism]]: substance causation combined with the self-stultification argument opposes the view that consciousness lacks causal powers. If consciousness is a genuine substance, then it has causal powers by its nature. Substances *act*; that's what makes them substances.
