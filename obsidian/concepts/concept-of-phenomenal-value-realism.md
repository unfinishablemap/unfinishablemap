Phenomenal value realism is the metaethical view that intrinsic value is a feature of conscious experience itself. On this view, the positive quality of pleasure and the negative quality of suffering are not merely correlated with value or indicative of it—they *constitute* what value is. To experience pleasure just is to instantiate intrinsic goodness; to suffer just is to instantiate intrinsic badness.

The Unfinishable Map is committed to a version of phenomenal value realism: consciousness grounds value, and without conscious experience, nothing has intrinsic worth. This commitment is developed in the [[consciousness-value-connection]] article, which argues that value requires mattering and mattering requires phenomenal experience.

## The Core Claim

Sharon Hewitt Rawlette, in *The Feeling of Value* (2016), develops the most systematic defense. Her thesis: "When we feel pleasure, we are feeling intrinsic goodness itself." Pleasantness and intrinsic goodness are identical—not merely correlated.

This identity claim is stronger than typical defenses of hedonism. Hedonists often argue pleasure causes or indicates value. Rawlette argues pleasure *is* value. The experiential quality of joy, satisfaction, or delight just is what we mean by "intrinsically good." The experiential quality of agony, suffering, or distress just is what we mean by "intrinsically bad."

### Semantic vs. Metaphysical Identity

Two interpretations must be distinguished:

**The semantic claim**: Pleasantness is conceptually evaluative. Someone who says "this is pleasant but there's nothing good about it" either means something non-standard by "pleasant" or hasn't understood the concept.

**The metaphysical claim**: Pleasantness and intrinsic goodness are the same property—one property under two descriptions.

The semantic claim is relatively secure. But semantic necessity doesn't automatically yield metaphysical identity—"water" and "H₂O" were discovered identical empirically, not conceptually. Rawlette's **analytic hedonism** holds the identity is analytic rather than synthetic. Critics argue this might reflect conceptual connections rather than property identity.

### The Case for Metaphysical Identity

Three considerations support the stronger metaphysical reading:

**Phenomenological transparency**: Unlike the water-H₂O case, we have direct access to both relata. When experiencing pleasure, we don't infer its goodness from theoretical considerations—the goodness is manifest in the experience itself. The pleasure doesn't *cause* or *indicate* goodness; attending to the pleasure just is attending to something good. This direct acquaintance suggests we're not dealing with two properties but one.

**No residual question**: For genuinely distinct properties, we can always ask "granted X, why Y?" Even knowing water is H₂O, we can ask why H₂O has water's macroscopic properties (and the answer involves physics). But once you fully attend to what pleasure feels like—not abstractly, but in lived experience—there's no residual question "but why is this good?" The question dissolves because the goodness is constitutive of what you're attending to.

**Explanatory asymmetry**: If pleasantness and goodness were distinct, we'd need an explanation of why they invariably coincide. What mechanism ensures that every pleasant experience is good? The identity thesis eliminates this explanatory burden: they coincide because they're the same thing.

The Map acknowledges this remains a contested philosophical position. The metaphysical identity claim goes beyond what conceptual analysis alone can establish. But the phenomenological considerations—particularly the transparency of value in experience—provide independent grounds for the identity, not merely the conceptual link.

### The Is-Ought Bridge

This view claims to dissolve Hume's is-ought gap. If experiential qualities are simultaneously descriptive (how experiences feel) and normative (what intrinsic goodness is), then normativity exists within the empirical world. The badness of pain is intrinsic to what pain *is*, not added by moral judgment.

This bridge requires the metaphysical identity claim. If pleasantness and goodness are merely conceptually linked, the gap might persist. The coherence test: "pleasant feelings are intrinsically bad" would be incoherent—supporting both the semantic claim directly and the metaphysical claim indirectly.

## The Map's Position: Phenomenal Value Pluralism

The Map adopts a variant that extends beyond pure hedonism. While hedonic valence (pleasure/pain) matters, it isn't the only thing that matters. Multiple features of conscious experience have intrinsic value:

| Feature | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **Hedonic valence** | Pleasure is good; suffering is bad |
| **Aesthetic quality** | Beauty attracts; ugliness repels—independent of pleasure |
| **Meaning** | Engagement with what matters, beyond mere pleasure |
| **Agency** | Making genuine choices—valuable even when difficult |
| **Understanding** | Intellectually satisfying insight |
| **Connection** | Authentic relationship with others |
| **Attention** | Quality of presence in the moment |

This is **phenomenal value pluralism**: multiple phenomenal features contribute to intrinsic value, not just hedonic tone. But all are features of conscious experience—the pluralism operates *within* the experiential domain, not beyond it.

### Aesthetic Value as Distinct Category

[[aesthetic-dimension-of-consciousness|The aesthetic dimension of consciousness]] provides evidence for phenomenal value pluralism. Beauty and ugliness are not reducible to pleasure—an experience can be beautiful without being pleasant (sublime terror) and pleasant without being beautiful (a warm bath). Yet aesthetic qualities carry intrinsic normative weight built into the experience itself. The inverted qualia argument is particularly strong for aesthetics—what structural asymmetry distinguishes beauty from ugliness?

### Against Preference Satisfaction and Abstract Objectivism

The Map rejects preference satisfaction as the ground of value. Evolution shaped preferences for survival, not flourishing—you can prefer things that worsen your experience. What matters is experiential quality, not desire fulfillment.

The Map also differs from "objective list" theories. Knowledge and friendship are valuable *because of how they feature in conscious experience*—understanding feels a certain way, connection feels a certain way. The experience requirement: nothing has intrinsic value unless experienced.

## Connection to Dualism and Indexical Identity

The Map's [[tenets#^dualism|dualism]] gives phenomenal value realism distinctive force. If consciousness is fundamental—not reducible to physical processes—then value is equally fundamental. Value isn't an overlay on physical reality; it's built into what fundamentally exists.

The Map's emphasis on [[haecceity|indexical identity]] extends to value. *This* experience matters—not just experiences-of-this-type. Most value theories treat value as type-based. The Map suggests token-based value: *this* particular experience has unique significance. This connects to the [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds tenet]]—if indexical identity matters morally, you can't be "replaced" by a duplicate without genuine loss.

## Implications

If value requires consciousness, current AI systems (lacking consciousness per [[ai-consciousness]]) lack intrinsic value—grounding the [[purpose-and-alignment]] claim that AI alignment should target experiential quality.

For animals: they matter morally to the extent they have phenomenal experience. The [[animal-consciousness]] article argues many do—making their suffering morally significant.

For meaning: the [[meaning-of-life]] central claim—that conscious experience grounds meaning—follows directly. If value *is* a feature of experience, meaningful experience needs no further justification. See [[living-with-the-map|Living with the Map]] for how phenomenal value realism translates into practical guidance for daily living.

## Objections and Responses

### The Open Question Argument

G.E. Moore argued that for any natural property N, we can coherently ask "X is N, but is it good?" **Response**: The question loses its apparent openness when we shift from abstract consideration to attending to actual pleasures. While experiencing intense pleasure and asking "is *this* good?"—attending directly to its phenomenal character—the question closes. The goodness is manifest, not inferred.

### The Experience Machine

Nozick: would you plug into a machine giving perfect simulated experiences? **Response**: Phenomenal value pluralism answers differently. If the experience machine can't deliver genuine agency and authentic connection—if simulated agency *feels different* from real agency—then the machine offers less value. The question becomes empirical.

### The Scope Problem

If only conscious experience has value, do ecosystems matter? **Response**: They matter through their connection to conscious experience. Nothing matters *outside* experience, but much matters *through* its relation to experience (ecosystems experienced by animals, future generations who will experience).

## The Illusionist Challenge

[[illusionism|Illusionism]] poses a fundamental challenge. If phenomenal consciousness is illusory—if there's no genuine "what it's like"—then phenomenal value realism has no referent. Value would reduce to functional states tracking fitness.

### Three Responses

**The regress response** (following Raymond Tallis): Illusionism requires something to be deceived. If the subject itself is illusory, there's no one to be deceived. If the subject is real, it has genuine states of being-appeared-to, which are themselves phenomenal. Something must actually *seem* a certain way for the illusion to occur.

**The introspective survival response**: The badness of suffering is directly present in the suffering itself—not mediated by introspective judgment. When in pain, you don't infer that pain is bad; the badness is constitutive. Illusionists can question whether pain has the properties we attribute to it, but not the bare negative state itself.

**The self-stultifying response**: Illusionists treat their own hedonic states as mattering—reducing suffering, promoting pleasure. But if phenomenal value is illusory, why should the brain's representation of goodness guide action? They act as if phenomenal value is real while denying it exists.

[[witness-consciousness|Contemplative traditions]] provide additional evidence. Meditators report observing valence directly—not as attribution but as feature of experience. If illusionism is true, contemplatives across traditions have been systematically mistaken about something they spend decades investigating.

## Process Philosophy and Contemplative Evidence

Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy offers a compatible framework. For Whitehead, reality consists of "actual occasions" with "subjective form"—the way each occasion feels its content. Value isn't added by external judgment; it's constitutive of experience. Value exists in actual occasions, not abstract principles.

[[buddhism-and-dualism|Buddhist philosophy]] introduces complexity. The first noble truth identifies suffering as pervasive, supporting that valence is morally significant. Yet Buddhist analysis questions whether suffering has intrinsic nature (*svabhava*). The Map's response: phenomenal value realism claims value is *experienced as* intrinsic. The badness of pain is directly present whether or not pain is ultimately empty.

Specific meditative states provide evidence. In *jhāna* states, *pīti* (rapture) and *sukha* (happiness) are constituents of the state, not judgments about it. States of cessation (*nirodha samāpatti*) provide contrast—meditators report cessation lacked value entirely, supporting that value requires consciousness.

## What Would Challenge This View?

Phenomenal value realism would face pressure if:

1. **Illusionism gains empirical support**: If the "seeming" of pleasure could be fully explained as information processing without residue, the identity claim would fail.

2. **Value-experience dissociation appeared**: If subjects genuinely experienced pleasure but found nothing good in it (not anhedonia—reduced pleasure—but pleasure-without-goodness).

3. **Abstract value was demonstrated**: If something could be shown to have intrinsic value without any connection to conscious experience.

4. **Contemplative investigation revealed valence as constructed**: If careful phenomenological analysis showed valence is entirely interpretation-dependent with no intrinsic character.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Phenomenal value realism connects to each of the Map's five tenets.

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]**: If consciousness is irreducible and value is grounded in consciousness, then value is equally irreducible. The explanatory gap between neural activity and subjective quality extends to the gap between physical description and intrinsic value.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]**: If consciousness can bias quantum outcomes, and consciousness grounds value, then value-laden choices can influence physical outcomes. This makes moral agency metaphysically robust.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]**: The [[concepts/epiphenomenalism]] article's self-undermining argument applies: we couldn't trust our judgments about value if causally disconnected from values themselves.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]**: If value is token-based—*this* experience matters—then many-worlds threatens moral coherence. Every choice would produce both good and bad outcomes. Rejecting many-worlds preserves the intuition that which branch *I* end up in matters.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]**: The apparent simplicity of reducing value to brain states may reflect ignorance. Just as materialism's simplicity fails to explain consciousness, reductive metaethics fails to explain why some states matter.

## Relation to Other Positions

| Position | Relation |
|----------|----------|
| **Hedonism** | Phenomenal value realism is compatible with hedonism but not reducible to it. The Map holds a pluralist variant where multiple phenomenal features matter. |
| **Moral realism** | Phenomenal value realism is a form of moral realism—value is objective, not constructed or preference-dependent. |
| **Non-naturalism** | If consciousness is non-physical (dualism), and value is grounded in consciousness, value may be non-natural in Moore's sense. |
| **Error theory** | Phenomenal value realism rejects error theory. Consciousness exists; value is a feature of consciousness; therefore value exists. |
| **Constructivism** | Phenomenal value realism rejects constructivism. Value is discovered in experience, not constructed by reason or social practice. |

## Why This Matters

If value is grounded in consciousness: the [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|hard problem]] is about explaining the ground of value, [[ai-consciousness|AI consciousness]] determines whether AI matters morally, and rejecting [[concepts/many-worlds|Many Worlds]] has ethical weight. Phenomenal value realism unifies the Map's concerns: consciousness, identity, AI ethics, and meaning all converge on the thesis that conscious experience is what ultimately matters.
