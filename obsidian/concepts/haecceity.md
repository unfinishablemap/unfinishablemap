Haecceity (from Latin *haec*, "this") is the quality of being *this* particular thing rather than another qualitatively identical thing. For consciousness, haecceity grounds the difference between being *you* and being someone with your exact properties—a distinction pattern-based theories cannot capture. This concept is central to the site's rejection of [[many-worlds|many-worlds interpretation]], its treatment of [[personal-identity]], and its response to the [[pairing-problem]].

## The Concept

Medieval philosopher Duns Scotus introduced haecceity to explain what individuates things. Two atoms can share all their qualitative properties—mass, charge, spin—yet remain numerically distinct. What makes atom A different from atom B? Scotus answered: their haecceities, their primitive "thisness."

Modern discussions distinguish:

**Qualitative properties**: Features that can be shared. Being red, weighing 5kg, having such-and-such memories—any number of things could have these properties.

**Haecceity**: The non-qualitative, non-transferable property of being *this* particular thing. Unlike qualitative properties, haecceity cannot be duplicated. A perfect replica would share all qualitative properties but necessarily differ in haecceity.

**Indexical facts**: Facts specifiable only using indexicals like "I," "here," "now." The fact that *I* am writing this sentence cannot be reduced to facts about some person writing a sentence—because there might be multiple people writing identical sentences, and only one of them is me.

These concepts converge for consciousness. The question "Why am I this subject and not another?" presupposes that being this subject is a genuine fact—a haecceitistic fact not reducible to qualitative features of my psychology.

## Haecceitism vs Anti-Haecceitism

Philosophers divide on whether haecceitistic differences are genuine.

**Haecceitists** hold that two possible worlds can differ solely in which individuals play which roles—even if all qualitative facts are the same. Max Black's famous example: a universe containing only two qualitatively identical spheres. They occupy different locations but share all intrinsic properties. On haecceitism, there's a further fact about which sphere is which. Swap them and you have a different (though qualitatively identical) situation.

**Anti-haecceitists** deny this. If two situations are qualitatively identical, they're the same situation. There's no further fact about which sphere is which. Identity supervenes on qualitative character.

For personal identity, the stakes are high:

**Anti-haecceitist view**: What makes you you is entirely constituted by qualitative facts—your memories, psychology, physical constitution. A perfect replica would be you (or as much "you" as the original). Derek Parfit's view exemplifies this: personal identity reduces to psychological continuity, and identity can branch or fuse.

**Haecceitist view**: What makes you you includes something non-qualitative—your haecceity, your thisness. A perfect replica shares all qualitative properties but lacks your haecceity. It's not you. Identity cannot branch because haecceity cannot be divided or copied.

## Why Consciousness Requires Haecceity

The site's [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]] tenet treats consciousness as irreducible to physical processes. This commitment has haecceitistic implications.

Consider the [[philosophical-zombies|zombie argument]]: a creature physically identical to you but lacking consciousness is conceivable. If zombies are possible, consciousness is not determined by physical/functional properties. But then what determines that *this* physical system has consciousness while an identical zombie lacks it?

The answer cannot be purely qualitative. By hypothesis, you and your zombie twin share all qualitative physical properties. The difference must be non-qualitative: you have the property of being *this* conscious subject; the zombie lacks it.

This is haecceity applied to consciousness. The fact that you are conscious is not just a qualitative fact about your brain states—it's the fact that *this* subject exists and experiences.

## The Site's Indexical Emphasis

The [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]] tenet explicitly invokes indexical identity. The objection to many-worlds isn't merely ontological (too many universes) or probabilistic (the Born rule problem). It's fundamentally about identity:

"Before measurement, there is one you. After measurement, many-worlds says there are two equally real continuations. Yet you find yourself in exactly one. The experience of being this one rather than that one seems to be a fact—but many-worlds says it's not."

This presupposes haecceitism. If anti-haecceitism were true, there would be no further fact about which branch "you" are in. Both branches contain persons continuous with your pre-measurement self; that's all there is to say. The question "Which one is really me?" would be confused.

But the question doesn't seem confused. You will have one sequence of experiences, not two. The felt reality of being *this* observer in *this* branch suggests a haecceitistic fact—that indexical identity is not reducible to qualitative continuity.

The [[many-worlds|dedicated MWI critique]] develops five arguments against many-worlds, but the indexical identity problem is the one that most directly invokes haecceity. MWI defenders (Deutsch, Carroll) respond via "self-locating uncertainty"—treating pre-measurement uncertainty about which branch you'll find yourself in as analogous to uncertainty about which room you woke up in. But self-locating uncertainty normally involves a single world with indexically uncertain facts. On MWI, there's no fact to be uncertain about—both outcomes are equally real, and "you" end up in both. The uncertainty framework seems inapplicable when all outcomes occur.

## Self-Locating Beliefs

Epistemologists discuss "self-locating beliefs"—beliefs about where you are in the world, not just what the world is like. These involve essential indexicals.

Consider: "There is a person in a red room" vs "I am in a red room." The first describes the world impersonally. The second locates me within it. Even knowing all impersonal facts about the world, I might not know which person I am—which requires self-location.

David Lewis's "Two Gods" scenario: Two omniscient gods know all qualitative facts about the universe but are uncertain which god each one is. This suggests self-locating knowledge is distinct from qualitative knowledge.

For consciousness:

**The problem of other minds** asks how I know others are conscious. But there's a prior question: how do I know that *I* am this conscious being rather than another? I experience from one perspective, yet there might be many qualitatively similar perspectives in the universe. What makes *this* one mine?

The answer requires haecceity. I am this subject not because of qualitative features I alone possess (my duplicate shares them) but because of the non-qualitative fact of being *this* one.

## Teleportation and Uploading

The haecceity question becomes vivid in technological scenarios:

**Teletransportation**: Your body is scanned, destroyed, and reconstructed from different matter on Mars. The result shares all qualitative properties—memories, psychology, physical structure. Is it you?

Anti-haecceitists say yes. Personal identity is qualitative continuity. The Mars person is psychologically continuous with you. What more could "being you" require?

Haecceitists say no. The Mars person has your qualities but lacks your haecceity. When the Earth body was destroyed, *you* ceased to exist. A qualitative replica emerged on Mars—but it's a new subject, not you continued.

**Mind uploading**: Your neural patterns are copied to a computer simulation. The simulation has your memories, thinks it's you, behaves as you would.

Anti-haecceitists see survival. You now exist as a computational pattern.

Haecceitists see death and replacement. The simulation is a copy with your qualities. But *you*—this particular conscious subject—ended when your brain stopped.

The site's framework aligns with haecceitism here. The [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet holds that consciousness causally influences physical outcomes. Your consciousness has a specific causal history—the quantum selections, neural influences, and physical effects constituting your life. A replica's consciousness would begin a new causal history. Even if qualitatively identical at the moment of copying, the replica isn't *this* consciousness with *this* history.

## Connection to the Pairing Problem

The [[pairing-problem]] asks what connects a particular mind to a particular body. Jaegwon Kim argues that if minds lack spatial location, nothing can ground the pairing.

The haecceity response (Bailey, Rasmussen, Van Horn 2011) appeals directly to thisness: M1 is paired with B1 because of the haecceitistic fact that *this* mind is causally related to *this* body. The pairing is primitive—not grounded in qualitative or spatial relations.

This may seem to explain little. But the criticism applies to any theory of individuation. What makes *this* electron distinct from *that* one? Physics offers no qualitative answer—electrons are indistinguishable. Yet numerical distinctness seems real. If physics relies on haecceity for particles, dualism can rely on it for minds.

## MWI and the Probability Problem

The [[many-worlds#3. The Probability Problem|probability problem]] for many-worlds connects to haecceity. In many-worlds, after a spin measurement, there are branches with spin-up and branches with spin-down. All exist equally. Why do we observe Born-rule statistics?

Proposed solutions invoke self-locating uncertainty: before looking at the result, you're uncertain which branch you're in. Decision theory allegedly recovers the Born rule from rational constraints on such uncertainty.

But this presupposes that there's a fact about which branch you're in—a haecceitistic fact. If personal identity is purely qualitative (anti-haecceitism), all branches equally contain your continuers. There's no "you" to be uncertain about which branch contains you. The self-locating uncertainty is ill-defined.

Many-worlds theorists who embrace anti-haecceitism must find another route to the Born rule. Many who accept self-locating uncertainty are implicitly haecceitists—accepting that indexical facts are real even when qualitative facts are symmetric.

### Decision-Theoretic Defenses

Sophisticated MWI defenders (Wallace 2012, Greaves 2007) argue that decision theory can derive the Born rule without haecceitistic assumptions. On their view, a rational agent facing quantum uncertainty should assign credences to branches weighted by their squared amplitude—not because of facts about which branch they'll end up in, but because this weighting follows from rational constraints on preferences across branching scenarios.

**Response**: These decision-theoretic derivations face their own challenges. The "rationality" constraints they invoke (separability, continuity, etc.) arguably presuppose that there's something it's like to be a particular agent making decisions—which reintroduces the subject whose identity is in question. More fundamentally, the question "What should I care about?" presupposes an "I" whose interests are at stake. If both post-measurement branches equally contain my continuers, why should I weight one more than another? The caring itself seems to require indexical identity.

The broader [[many-worlds|MWI critique]] identifies four additional problems beyond probability—ontological extravagance, the preferred basis problem, and consciousness remaining unexplained. But the indexical identity problem and the probability problem both hinge on haecceity. If "you" can genuinely end up in multiple branches with equal claim to being you, the very concept of betting on outcomes becomes incoherent. What would you be betting *about*?

## Objections to Haecceity

**Explanatory emptiness**: Haecceity seems to name rather than explain. What makes you *this* subject? Your haecceity. What is your haecceity? Being this subject. The explanation is circular.

**Response**: This objection proves too much. What makes an electron have charge -e? The fact that it has that charge. Fundamental properties bottom out somewhere. Haecceity may be fundamental—individuating things at the base level.

**Parsimony**: Why posit primitive thisness when qualitative properties suffice?

**Response**: Qualitative properties *don't* suffice if zombies are possible. If two things can share all qualitative properties while one is conscious and the other isn't, something non-qualitative distinguishes them. Haecceity is the natural candidate.

**Modal concerns**: Haecceitism implies that merely "swapping" individuals creates a different possible world even if qualitatively identical. This multiplies possibilities without empirical difference.

**Response**: This multiplication may reflect genuine metaphysical structure. The question "What if I had been you?" seems meaningful even if empirically undetectable. Haecceitism honors this intuition.

### The Illusionist Challenge

[[illusionism|Illusionists]] like Dennett and Frankish argue that phenomenal consciousness is itself an illusion—the brain represents itself as having qualitative states it doesn't actually possess. If phenomenal consciousness doesn't exist in the robust sense haecceitism requires, then haecceity about conscious subjects is haecceity about a fiction.

**Response**: The illusionist position faces a regress problem (Tallis 2016). For something to *seem* a certain way, there must be a subject to whom it seems that way—and this seeming is itself phenomenal. The illusion of consciousness requires consciousness to be an illusion *for*. Even if the content of experience is illusory, the subject of that illusion must exist. And if that subject exists, the question of which subject it is—the haecceitistic question—remains live.

Furthermore, the illusionist who argues against haecceity performatively assumes their own indexical identity. *This* illusionist makes *this* argument, and expects *you* to be convinced. If there were no fact about which subject is arguing and which is reading, the dialectical situation would be incoherent.

### The Buddhist Challenge

Buddhist philosophy, particularly Madhyamaka, argues that the self is *sunyata* (empty)—lacking inherent existence. If there is no substantial self, haecceity about selves is haecceity about nothing. The "thisness" is itself empty.

**Response**: The Buddhist analysis may be compatible with a refined haecceitism. The self can be empty of *qualitative* essence while still being *this* particular process. Consider: Buddhist philosophy doesn't deny that *this* person experiences *this* moment—it denies that there's a permanent, unchanging self underlying the experience. But haecceity doesn't require permanence; it requires particularity. *This* stream of experience, however impermanent and constructed, is still distinguishable from *that* stream. The indexical fact remains even if the referent is a process rather than a substance.

This interpretation suggests haecceity may be more about the particularity of experiential processes than about substantial souls—a view potentially compatible with both [[buddhism-and-dualism|Buddhist insights]] and the site's framework.

## Process Philosophy and Haecceity

Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy offers a complementary perspective. For Whitehead, reality consists of "actual occasions"—momentary experiential events that arise, prehend (grasp) their predecessors, and perish. Each actual occasion has what Whitehead called a "subjective form"—the particular way it experiences its data.

This framework suggests haecceity can be temporal as well as spatial. Each moment of experience is *this* moment, unrepeatable and particular. Two actual occasions might prehend identical data yet differ in their subjective form—just as two subjects might share all qualitative properties yet differ in haecceity.

The connection to quantum mechanics is suggestive. Whitehead proposed that actual occasions involve something like quantum collapse—the transition from potentiality to actuality. If consciousness participates in collapse through the [[attention-as-interface|quantum Zeno mechanism]], then the subject making selections is precisely the haecceitistic "this" that actualizes one possibility rather than another. The particularity of *this* subject grounds the particularity of *this* selection.

## What Would Challenge This View?

The haecceitistic framework would be challenged by:

1. **Successful illusionist reduction**: If neuroscience could fully explain why we *seem* to be particular subjects without positing actual particularity—explaining the seeming without the being—haecceity about consciousness would lose its motivation.

2. **Decision-theoretic success**: If MWI defenders could derive the Born rule from rationality constraints that genuinely don't presuppose indexical identity, the anti-MWI argument from haecceity would be weakened.

3. **Successful replication consciousness transfer**: If someone were teleported and the original destroyed, and the replica reported continuous memory and no experiential discontinuity, this would support anti-haecceitism—though such reports couldn't settle whether the original subject survived or a new one emerged with false memories of continuity.

4. **Explanatory reduction of thisness**: If haecceity could be reduced to some combination of qualitative properties we haven't yet identified, the primitive status of thisness would be undermined.

5. **Buddhist-style dissolution**: If contemplative practice consistently revealed the self to be a construction with no bearer—not just philosophically but experientially—this would challenge the phenomenological basis for haecceitistic intuitions.

These challenges remain unmet, but their form clarifies what the haecceitistic commitment claims.

## The Site's Commitment

The site doesn't explicitly endorse "haecceitism" by name. But its commitments imply haecceity about conscious subjects:

1. **Dualism**: Consciousness isn't reducible to physical/functional properties. Therefore qualitative physical identity doesn't guarantee conscious identity.

2. **No Many Worlds**: The indexical question "Which branch am I in?" is meaningful. This requires a fact about which conscious subject I am—a haecceitistic fact.

3. **Bidirectional Interaction**: *This* consciousness causally affects *this* brain. The pairing is a further fact beyond qualitative relations.

4. **Anti-Patternism**: The [[personal-identity]] discussion rejects Parfit's view that personal identity reduces to psychological continuity. What persists is *this* subject, not merely a pattern that could be replicated.

The haecceity concept makes explicit what the site presupposes. Personal identity is not pattern identity. *You* are not interchangeable with a qualitative duplicate. Being this conscious subject is a primitive fact—your haecceity.

## Relation to Site Tenets

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]**: If consciousness is irreducible, haecceity provides the individuating principle. Physical facts don't fix which subject exists; haecceity does.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]**: Rejecting many-worlds because of indexical identity questions presupposes haecceitism. Without haecceity, there's no fact about which branch contains "you."

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]**: Consciousness's causal role implies its particularity. *This* consciousness affects outcomes, not consciousness-in-general. Haecceity grounds the particularity.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]**: Parsimony might favor anti-haecceitism (fewer metaphysical primitives). But if consciousness shows that qualitative properties underdetermine mental facts, parsimony shouldn't override the evidence.
