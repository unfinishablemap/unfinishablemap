Cognitive science has investigated whether humans naturally think of minds and bodies as distinct—and the evidence is more complex than either side of the dualism debate typically acknowledges. Paul Bloom argued we are "natural-born dualists," processing minds and bodies through separate cognitive systems from infancy. But cross-cultural research challenges this: Barrett et al. (2021) found most people across diverse cultures default to **intuitive materialism**, expecting mental states to cease at death. The debate illuminates human psychology without settling the metaphysical question—cognitive naturalness doesn't determine truth.

## Bloom's Natural-Born Dualists

Paul Bloom's *Descartes' Baby* (2004) proposed that humans have two distinct cognitive systems from infancy: **folk physics** (governing objects—solidity, gravity, continuity) and **folk psychology** (governing agents—beliefs, desires, goals). Babies find it unremarkable when people move without physical contact but are surprised if objects do the same. By age four, children naturally accept body swaps, ghosts, and survival after death.

Cross-cultural studies supported this. Chudek et al. (2018) found early-emerging dualistic intuitions in both Canadian and Indigenous Fijian children. Richert and Harris (2008) showed that even after children learn brains produce thinking, they continue treating mental states as somehow different—the dualistic view is present early and later *suppressed* by neuroscientific knowledge, not eliminated.

Bloom's conclusion: because these cognitive mechanisms operate independently, dualism isn't a philosophical discovery but a cognitive default. Some materialists seized on this to dismiss dualism as "folk error"—an artifact of cognitive architecture to be outgrown through scientific education.

## The Cross-Cultural Challenge

Barrett et al.'s 2021 study challenged Bloom's thesis. They recruited over 2,000 participants across six populations (North Americans, Ecuadorians, Fijians, Ghanaians, Thai Buddhists, Vanuatu Islanders). The key finding: "Most responses of most participants across all cultures were *not* dualist." Even in cultures with strong afterlife traditions, people intuitively expected mental states to cease with bodily death.

Barrett et al. proposed the cognitive default is actually **intuitive materialism**: the underlying systems for reasoning about minds produce judgments that mental states cease with death. Dualist beliefs require cultural transmission rather than expressing innate tendencies. This reverses the standard picture—dualism isn't the folk error to be corrected; it's a learned position.

## The Learning Debate

Barlev and Shtulman (2021) found that conceptions of disembodied beings develop slowly over childhood. Children don't start as dualists who are later educated into materialism; they acquire dualist concepts through cultural learning. Counterintuitive ideas like disembodied minds may be prevalent precisely *because* they are counterintuitive—such ideas have transmission advantages in cultural evolution.

Berent et al. (2024) added an unexpected data point: large language models develop dualist-seeming representations without innate architecture. If dualism is learnable without specialized cognitive modules, the case for innate dualism weakens.

## Bering's Simulation Constraint

Jesse Bering (2002, 2006) proposed that simulation constraints make afterlife belief a "cognitive default"—we cannot imagine not existing, so we assume psychological states continue after death. His experiments found that even "extinctivists" implicitly attributed epistemic states to dead agents more readily than biological traits.

Barrett et al.'s cross-cultural data complicates this: if simulation constraints were universal, most people should show dualist intuitions. They don't.

## The Two-System View Refined

A more nuanced framework: two cognitive systems (folk physics and folk psychology) do exist, but their *separability* doesn't automatically produce dualism. The systems can operate independently without generating intuitions that minds can exist without bodies. Willard and Norenzayan (2013) found that [[theory-of-mind|mentalizing]] leads to dualism as a *pathway*, not a universal default—some individuals traverse it more than others based on mentalizing tendencies. See [[cognitive-science-of-dualism]] for how these findings fit within the broader methodological landscape of consciousness research.

## Implications for Philosophy

The cognitive science debate is fascinating but philosophically limited. Whether humans naturally think dualistically tells us nothing about whether dualism is *true*.

### The Genetic Fallacy

Explaining why people believe X doesn't show X is false. Folk physics is largely accurate for everyday objects despite being wrong about quantum mechanics. Folk biology captures real biological kinds despite taxonomic errors. If dualism is cognitively natural, it might capture something real about minds. If dualism is learned, it might still be true—many truths require education to grasp.

### The Symmetric Problem

If cognitive naturalness disqualifies beliefs, intuitive materialism (if that's the default) would also be suspect. Why trust evolved intuitions about death and mental cessation? Evolution shaped cognition for survival, not metaphysical accuracy. Neither intuitive dualism nor intuitive materialism has privileged epistemic standing on these grounds.

### The Hard Problem Remains

Even if cognitive science fully explains *why* people believe in mind-body distinction, this doesn't explain consciousness itself. The explanatory gap between physical description and subjective experience isn't a cognitive illusion that proper theory-of-mind integration would dissolve. Mary still learns something when she sees red for the first time. [[Philosophical-zombies|Zombies]] remain conceivable. The qualitative character of experience remains unexplained by neuroscience.

Explaining the belief doesn't explain the explanandum.

## The Illusionist Challenge

[[illusionism|Illusionists]] argue the question of whether dualism is cognitively natural is moot—there are no phenomenal properties to be dualist or materialist *about*. On this view, we systematically misrepresent our mental states as having qualitative character they lack.

The Map rejects illusionism for reasons independent of cognitive naturalness. The [[illusionism#The Infinite Regress Problem|regress problem]] applies: if mind-body distinction is an illusion, something must be *experiencing* this illusion. Keith Frankish argues that "quasi-phenomenal properties" can create the illusion of phenomenality without phenomenality itself—but this requires explaining what fixes the determinacy of representations (why "represents red" rather than "represents generic colour") and how mere functional covariation generates the *conviction* of phenomenality.

Contemplative evidence also weighs against illusionism. Trained meditators report that practice *refines* phenomenal access rather than dissolving the illusion. Fox et al. (2012) found meditation experience predicts introspective accuracy on objective measures, not merely increased confidence. See [[illusionism]] for full analysis.

## Process Philosophy Perspective

Whitehead's process philosophy reframes the debate. Each "actual occasion" has both a physical pole (receiving causal influences) and a mental pole (subjective response). Mind and body aren't separate substances—they're aspects of every event. This explains why neither intuitive dualism nor intuitive materialism wins cleanly: intuitive materialists correctly sense that mental states depend on embodiment (a point the [[embodied-cognition]] programme reinforces); intuitive dualists correctly sense that experience has irreducible character. The cross-cultural variability may reflect which pole different cultures emphasize.

## Contemplative Perspectives

Contemplative traditions offer evidence beyond untrained intuitions. Buddhist psychology finds neither substance dualism nor materialism—only streams of momentary mental events including irreducibly mental elements (feelings, perceptions, volitions). Cross-cultural reports of [[witness-consciousness]]—stable awareness observing experience without being identical to content—suggest trained observation reveals something systematic fitting neither Bloom's innate dualism nor Barrett's intuitive materialism. See [[first-person-third-person-methodology]] for the methodological debate.

## What Would Challenge This View?

The position that cognitive naturalness doesn't determine metaphysical truth would be undermined if: (1) cognitive architecture strictly constrained what can be true (implausible—we conceive quantum mechanics despite lacking intuitive systems for it); (2) trained introspection converged uniformly on either pole (current evidence suggests convergence on positions transcending the dichotomy); (3) explaining the belief fully explained the phenomenon (but explaining why we believe pain hurts doesn't explain *why pain hurts*); or (4) intuitive materialism had privileged epistemic standing (no such asymmetry has been demonstrated).

## Relation to Site Perspective

### Dualism

The [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism tenet]] asserts consciousness is irreducible to physical processes—a claim standing on philosophical argument, not cognitive naturalness. The "folk error" dismissal fails on its own terms: dualism cannot be written off as naive intuition when cross-cultural evidence suggests intuitive *materialism* may be the default. The Map's position rests on [[the-case-for-dualism|positive arguments]]—the [[explanatory-gap]], [[philosophical-zombies|conceivability arguments]], the [[knowledge-argument]]—independently of cognitive anthropology.

### Minimal Quantum Interaction

The [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet]] specifies *where* mind-body interaction occurs—at quantum indeterminacies. Evolution would produce intuitions tracking behaviorally relevant distinctions, not quantum-level mechanisms. The [[quantum-neural-timing-constraints|280-300ms neural decision windows]] identified in Libet-type experiments are behaviorally visible; the quantum events within them are causally efficacious without being introspectively accessible.

### Bidirectional Interaction

The [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction tenet]] receives indirect support: if consciousness were epiphenomenal, why invest neural resources modeling something that doesn't affect behaviour? The existence of folk psychology suggests minds have causal efficacy worth tracking. The direct evidence comes from [[attention-as-interface|voluntary attention]] and studies like Schwartz's OCD research showing mindful attention changing brain activity.

### No Many Worlds

The [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds tenet]] connects through indexical identity. Both intuitive dualism and intuitive materialism assume singular observers with determinate identities—the persistence of this assumption across cultures may reflect genuine features of conscious experience ([[haecceity|indexical identity]]).

### Occam's Razor Has Limits

The [[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits tenet]] receives the most direct support. Cognitive science has reversed its consensus in two decades—from "innate dualism" to "intuitive materialism may be default." The simplest story is rarely the final story when investigating consciousness.
