Buddhism rejects a permanent self while taking consciousness seriously. This site commits to irreducible consciousness interacting with matter. Are these positions compatible? The answer depends on distinguishing what each actually claims—and what each actually denies.

Buddhism's *anattā* (no-self) doctrine targets a specific conception: the Hindu *ātman*, an eternal soul-substance that persists unchanged through rebirth. Buddhism denies this. But denying a permanent soul-substance is not the same as denying that consciousness exists, that experience is real, or that phenomenal properties resist reduction to physical processes. The site's [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]] tenet requires consciousness to be irreducible—it does not explicitly require consciousness to be permanent.

## What Buddhism Actually Denies

Buddhist no-self targets three specific claims:

**Permanence**: Nothing unchanging underlies the stream of experience. The "self" that seems to persist from moment to moment is actually a continuous process of arising and passing away. The flame tonight is causally connected to yesterday's flame but is not the same flame.

**Substantiality**: There is no soul-stuff distinct from the five aggregates (form, feeling, perception, mental formations, consciousness). What we call "self" is just these aggregates in dynamic interaction—no further entity stands behind them.

**Ownership-centricity**: The sense that experiences happen *to* a stable owner—"my" thoughts, "my" feelings—is a construct that meditation reveals to be empty. Experience happens; ownership is imputed.

Buddhism accepts that consciousness (*vijñāna*) is real—it's one of the five aggregates. Buddhism doesn't say "consciousness is an illusion" (that would be eliminativism, which Buddhism rejects). It says "the permanent self *owning* consciousness is an illusion."

## What the Site's Dualism Actually Claims

The Dualism tenet states: "Consciousness is not reducible to physical processes." This claim is distinct from several others it might be confused with:

**The site does not require substance dualism**: The tenet doesn't say consciousness is a *substance* separate from matter. It says consciousness cannot be *reduced to* physical descriptions—that no complete physical account captures what experience is like.

**The site does not require a permanent soul**: The tenet doesn't specify whether consciousness persists eternally, changes moment to moment, or ceases at death. It makes a claim about the relationship between consciousness and physics, not about temporal duration.

**The site does not require a unified self**: The tenet is compatible with consciousness being fragmented, multiple, or constantly reconstructed. [[phenomenal-unity]] is addressed separately.

What the site requires is *irreducibility*: at any given moment, conscious experience has properties that no physical description captures. This is the [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|hard problem]]—why there is something it is like to undergo certain physical processes.

## The Compatibility Thesis

Buddhism and the site's dualism can coexist if we distinguish two claims:

1. **Irreducibility** (site's tenet): Phenomenal properties cannot be reduced to physical properties
2. **Impermanence** (Buddhist doctrine): No phenomenal properties persist unchanged

These are logically independent. Consciousness can be irreducible at each moment while being impermanent across moments. Just as a candle flame is irreducibly a flame (not reducible to descriptions of wax and wick) while constantly changing, consciousness can be irreducibly experiential while constantly arising and passing.

This aligns with **property dualism** rather than substance dualism. At each moment there are both physical properties (mass, charge, position) and phenomenal properties (the felt quality of experience). Neither set of properties belongs to a permanent substance; both participate in the flux of dependent origination (*pratītyasamutpāda*). But within that flux, the phenomenal is not reducible to the physical.

The Yogācāra ("Mind-Only") school provides another bridge. By treating consciousness as fundamental—what appears as external world being mental construction—Yogācāra aligns with the site's rejection of physicalism while maintaining Buddhist impermanence. Consciousness is fundamental *and* constantly changing.

## Karma and Bidirectional Interaction

The site's [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet holds that consciousness causally influences physical outcomes. Buddhist karma doctrine makes a structurally similar claim: mental states—particularly intentions (*cetanā*)—determine the moral quality of actions and generate consequences that shape future experience.

If consciousness were epiphenomenal (causally inert), karma would be incoherent. Intentions would be mere side-effects of physical brain processes, not genuine causal contributors. Both Buddhism and the site reject this picture. Mental states matter; consciousness does something.

The mechanism differs. The site proposes consciousness biases quantum-level outcomes that physics leaves undetermined. Buddhism doesn't engage with quantum mechanics (predating it by millennia). But the structural claim—mind causally affects world—is shared.

This raises a question Buddhism must answer independently: if there's no permanent self, what carries karma across lifetimes? The Buddhist response: causal continuity without substantial identity. The flame analogy again—the flame at midnight is causally connected to the flame at noon without being the same flame. Karma flows along causal chains without requiring a soul-substance to accumulate it.

## What Remains in Tension

Despite this compatibility, genuine tensions exist.

**The witness problem**: Buddhist meditation reveals [[witness-consciousness]]—the capacity to observe thoughts as objects without identification. This seems to require an observer distinct from what's observed. Some Buddhist schools (especially Advaita-influenced interpretations) lean toward a persistent witness; mainstream Buddhism denies any observer persists. The site takes no official position, but the phenomenology of witnessing—consciousness observing its own contents—supports the irreducibility claim.

**Minimal self**: [[self-and-consciousness#Minimal Self and Narrative Self|Phenomenological analysis]] (Zahavi, Gallagher) identifies a "minimal self"—the pre-reflective "for-me-ness" present in all experience. This isn't the narrative self Buddhism deconstructs; it's the structural feature that makes experience first-personal. Buddhism might accept this minimal self exists conventionally while denying it ultimate substantial reality. The site might accept this compromise—first-personal structure doesn't require permanence.

**Liberation vs. explanation**: Buddhism aims at *nirvana*—cessation of suffering through transformation of consciousness. The site aims at understanding consciousness's place in nature. These projects can complement but might ultimately diverge. Buddhism might say: "Why explain consciousness when you could transform it?" The site might respond: "Understanding might inform transformation."

## Yogācāra and the External World

One tension requires separate treatment. The site's Bidirectional Interaction assumes two relata: consciousness and physical reality. Yogācāra denies physical reality exists independently of consciousness. What is consciousness interacting *with* if everything is mind?

Several responses are available:

**Conventional vs. ultimate**: Buddhism distinguishes conventional and ultimate truth. Conventionally, there appears to be physical reality; mind-matter interaction happens at this level. Ultimately, all is mind—but the site's tenets might operate at the conventional level without ultimate metaphysical commitment.

**Madhyamaka resolution**: The Madhyamaka ("Middle Way") school denies inherent existence to both mind and matter without reducing either to the other. Mind and matter are empty of independent essence but conventionally real and distinct. Interaction between empty phenomena is unproblematic.

**Restricted dualism**: The site's dualism is between consciousness and *physical descriptions*. It claims phenomenal properties don't reduce to physical descriptions. This is compatible with both physical realism and idealism—either way, the gap between experience and physical description persists.

## Comparative Advantages

What does each framework offer the other?

**Buddhism offers the site:**
- Phenomenological precision from millennia of contemplative investigation
- The insight that permanence isn't required for irreducibility
- A worked example of taking consciousness seriously without physicalism
- Practical methods (meditation) for investigating consciousness directly

**The site offers Buddhism:**
- A mechanism (quantum selection) for how mental causation might work
- Integration with contemporary physics
- An alternative to both substance dualism and idealism
- Focus on explanation where Buddhism focuses on liberation

Neither needs to absorb the other. Buddhism remains a path to liberation; the site remains a framework for understanding. But recognizing their compatibility prevents false dichotomies—as if taking consciousness seriously required either a permanent soul (substance dualism) or denying its ultimate reality (eliminativism).

## Relation to Site Perspective

The comparison clarifies what the site's tenets actually require.

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]**: This tenet requires irreducibility, not permanence. Buddhism accepts irreducibility (consciousness isn't reducible to form, feeling, perception, or mental formations—it's distinct from the other aggregates) while denying permanence. Compatible.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]**: This tenet requires mental causation. Buddhism's karma doctrine requires the same. Compatible.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]**: This tenet emphasizes indexical identity—*this* particular perspective matters, not just the pattern. Buddhist emphasis on *this* moment, *this* life, *this* path to liberation resonates. The Middle Way rejects both eternalism (the self persists forever) and annihilationism (death is complete cessation). Similarly, the site rejects both soul-substance eternalism and physicalist deflation.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]**: Buddhist metaphysics (dependent origination, emptiness, rebirth, karma) is not simpler than materialism. Buddhism agrees that apparent simplicity doesn't determine truth. Compatible.

The comparison also reveals what Buddhism challenges: any residual attachment to a permanent observer, any assumption that taking consciousness seriously requires soul-substance. Buddhism offers a worked demonstration that consciousness can be fundamental, causally efficacious, and impermanent simultaneously. This is a constraint the site's framework should honor.
