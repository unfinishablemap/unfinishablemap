Relational quantum mechanics (RQM) is Carlo Rovelli's interpretation of quantum mechanics in which physical properties exist only as relations between systems, not as intrinsic features of things. There is no "view from nowhere"—all quantum facts are relative to specific observers, where "observer" means any physical system, not necessarily a conscious one. RQM explicitly removes any special role for consciousness in quantum measurement.

This interpretation directly conflicts with the project's [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet. Understanding why RQM works—and what it sacrifices to work—clarifies what's at stake in adopting a consciousness-based alternative.

## The Core Idea

Rovelli's insight begins with an analogy to special relativity. Einstein showed that velocity is always relative to a reference frame—there is no absolute velocity. RQM extends this relationality to quantum states: there is no absolute quantum state, only states relative to particular observers.

When system S interacts with system O, the interaction produces definite values—but only relative to O. Another system O′ that hasn't interacted with S may still describe S as in superposition. Both descriptions are correct within their respective perspectives. Apparent contradiction dissolves because neither perspective claims absolute truth.

Consider Wigner's friend: inside a lab, a physicist measures a spin and sees "up." Outside, Wigner hasn't yet interacted with the lab. According to RQM, the spin has a definite value relative to the physicist, but remains in superposition relative to Wigner. When Wigner opens the lab and interacts with the physicist, he will find results consistent with the physicist's earlier measurement. No paradox arises because "the spin is up" was never an absolute claim—it was always implicitly "the spin is up relative to the physicist."

## How RQM Dissolves the Measurement Problem

The [[measurement-problem|measurement problem]] asks: what causes quantum superpositions to collapse into definite outcomes? Standard quantum mechanics leaves "measurement" undefined, creating a conceptual gap.

RQM dissolves the problem by denying its premise. Collapse isn't a special process requiring explanation—it's what interaction looks like from the interacting system's perspective. Every physical interaction is a "measurement" that produces definite values for the interacting systems. No special observer status is needed. No boundary between quantum and classical is required. The wave function isn't a real entity that collapses—it's a calculational tool for predicting interaction outcomes.

The ontology consists of discrete events (sometimes called "flashes") where systems interact and properties actualize—always relative to the interacting partner. Reality is a web of relative facts, not an absolute state evolving in time.

## Challenges to RQM

RQM faces several objections, some more serious than others:

**The intersubjectivity problem.** If facts are relative, how does science work? How can physicists compare results if each has only their own relative facts? Rovelli and Adlam (2023) address this with "cross-perspective links"—the claim that measuring another observer's physical state reveals the relative facts that observer registered. Your measurement of my brain shows what measurements I made. Intersubjectivity is recovered through physical interaction.

**The solipsism objection.** Peter Lewis (2024) argues RQM leads to "epistemic solipsism"—an observer can't know anything beyond their immediate present experience. If all facts are relative to me, and I can only access my own relative facts, then claims about the external world become unjustifiable. Worse, this undermines the evidence for quantum mechanics itself. Lewis poses a dilemma: either RQM collapses into solipsism, or it abandons what made it distinctive.

**The locality question.** RQM claims to preserve locality despite Bell violations, arguing that EPR correlations reflect "common cause in indeterministic context" rather than faster-than-light influence. Critics like Pienaar argue this empties locality of meaningful content. If "locality" is compatible with perfect correlations between spacelike-separated measurements, the term no longer constrains anything.

**What counts as an observer?** RQM says any physical system can be an observer—but this leaves unclear what determines the boundaries of a "system." When does a collection of particles become an observer with its own perspective? The ontology of relative facts requires something to be relative to, but RQM provides no principled way to individuate observers.

## What RQM Removes

Rovelli is explicit: "There is nothing subjective, idealistic, or mentalistic, in RQM." This is a feature, not a bug—RQM succeeds by eliminating the special status of consciousness that other interpretations invoke.

The consequence: RQM provides no mechanism for [[mental-causation]]. If any physical interaction is a "measurement," then a rock measuring a photon is equivalent to a physicist measuring one. Consciousness adds nothing. The [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet—the claim that consciousness causally influences physical outcomes—has no place in RQM's framework.

For this project, that's the deal-breaker. RQM dissolves the measurement problem by dissolving the observer—making "observer" mean any physical system rather than a conscious subject. This elegantly avoids the [[multi-mind-collapse-problem]], but only by denying that consciousness matters at all.

## Why Understanding RQM Matters

Even for those who reject RQM, engaging with it clarifies what's at stake:

**The price of consciousness-causes-collapse.** RQM shows there's a coherent interpretation where consciousness plays no role. Choosing a consciousness-based framework isn't forced by quantum mechanics—it's a philosophical commitment. Understanding RQM helps distinguish what quantum mechanics requires from what the project's tenets add.

**The multi-observer problem.** RQM's treatment of multiple observers (each with valid but relative perspectives) illuminates the challenges consciousness-causes-collapse faces. If Alice's consciousness collapses the wavefunction and Bob's does too, how are their selections reconciled? RQM dissolves this by relativizing collapse to each observer. the project's alternative—[[interface-locality]]—achieves something similar by different means: each consciousness modulates only its own brain.

**Lessons for perspectivalism.** RQM's insight that intermediate states needn't be coordinated until observers interact has value even within a different framework. the project can accept that before Alice and Bob communicate, their brain states (modulated by their respective consciousnesses) needn't be compared. Agreement is verified only through physical interaction.

**The locality puzzle.** RQM claims locality through perspectival independence. the project's framework achieves locality differently: consciousness influences only local neural systems, not distant quantum events. Comparing these strategies clarifies what "locality" requires when consciousness is involved.

## RQM vs. Consciousness-Causes-Collapse: A Comparison

| Feature | RQM | Consciousness-Causes-Collapse |
|---------|-----|-------------------------------|
| What collapses? | Relative states actualize through interaction | Absolute wavefunction collapses |
| What is an observer? | Any physical system | Conscious subject |
| Consciousness role | None | Causes or modulates collapse |
| Multi-observer coordination | No coordination needed (relative facts) | Requires mechanism (interface locality) |
| Locality preserved? | Claimed via perspectivalism | Claimed via local neural modulation |
| Explains consciousness? | No (not its goal) | Aims to give consciousness causal role |
| Site compatibility | **Conflicts with Bidirectional Interaction** | **Aligns with tenets** |

## Relation to Site Perspective

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]:** RQM is compatible with physicalism—it requires no non-physical elements. the project's dualism finds no support here. However, RQM's emphasis on observer-relativity shares something with the project's rejection of "view from nowhere" physicalism, even if RQM doesn't draw dualist conclusions.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]:** RQM eliminates the need for any special interaction—consciousness plays no role in collapse. This directly conflicts with the tenet's proposal that consciousness biases quantum outcomes.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]:** **Direct conflict.** RQM explicitly removes consciousness from physics. If RQM is correct, consciousness cannot influence physical outcomes through quantum mechanisms. the project's central claim—that consciousness participates in determining quantum outcomes—fails.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]:** RQM also rejects many-worlds, treating collapse (relative to each observer) as real. Here the project and RQM agree: we don't branch into multiple copies.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]:** RQM might seem simpler—no need for consciousness in physics. But simplicity isn't truth. RQM's elegance doesn't explain why consciousness exists or why physical processes are accompanied by experience. It solves the measurement problem while ignoring the hard problem.

## Summary

Relational quantum mechanics offers a coherent interpretation where quantum facts are relative to observers, and "observer" means any physical system. It dissolves the measurement problem and avoids multi-observer paradoxes—but only by eliminating consciousness's special role.

the project rejects this trade-off. Understanding consciousness as causally efficacious matters more than interpretive elegance. But engaging with RQM clarifies what the project's framework adds beyond bare quantum mechanics: a commitment to consciousness as real, irreducible, and causally effective—not merely another physical system among many.
