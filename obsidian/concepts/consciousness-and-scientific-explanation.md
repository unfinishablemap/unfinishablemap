The most common objection to dualism is not philosophical but practical: that it stops science. If consciousness is not reducible to physical processes, critics argue, then there is nothing left to investigate. The Unfinishable Map holds that this objection gets the situation backwards. Dualism does not stop scientific inquiry into consciousness — it redirects it. Reduction is one form of scientific explanation. It is not the only form. Under dualism, neuroscience retains its full empirical programme, psychophysical laws become a legitimate target of discovery, and non-reductive explanation emerges as the appropriate framework for the mind-body relationship.

What changes under dualism is not whether science can study consciousness but what a complete explanation would look like.

## The "Science-Stopping" Charge

The accusation has a standard form. Patricia Churchland stated the point sharply: positing non-physical mental properties "is exactly as hopeful as interacting with poltergeists" (*Neurophilosophy*, 1986). Daniel Dennett has argued that dualism offers only a "skyhook" — an explanatory placeholder that explains nothing. The charge is that once you declare consciousness non-physical, you have abandoned the explanatory game.

This charge conflates two distinct claims. The first is that consciousness cannot be *reduced* to physical processes. The second is that consciousness cannot be *investigated* scientifically. Dualism makes the first claim. It does not make the second. The conflation arises because a particular model of scientific explanation — reductive explanation — has been treated as the only legitimate kind.

## What Neuroscience Explains Under Dualism

Under dualism, neuroscience explains exactly what it explains under physicalism: the neural processes that correlate with, enable, and constrain conscious experience. Nothing about the empirical programme of neuroscience requires that consciousness *be* a neural process. It requires only that consciousness and neural processes be systematically related.

Consider the [[neural-correlates-of-consciousness|neural correlates of consciousness]] (NCCs). NCC research identifies which neural activity patterns are present when specific experiences occur — which regions activate during visual awareness, which oscillatory patterns accompany attention, which disruptions eliminate consciousness entirely. This research is valuable under any metaphysics. Under physicalism, NCCs are (or constitute) consciousness. Under dualism, NCCs are the physical conditions that correlate with consciousness — the interface through which mind and brain connect.

The empirical predictions are identical. Whether the relationship is identity or correlation, the same experiments are informative, the same neural disruptions eliminate the same experiences, and the same imaging data maps the same functional relationships. The difference is in what the findings *mean*, not in what they *are*.

Dualism does make one additional prediction that physicalism does not: that the correlation between neural activity and conscious experience is lawful but not identical. This means the [[explanatory-gap]] is not a temporary gap in scientific understanding but a permanent feature reflecting a genuine ontological distinction. Under physicalism, the gap should eventually close as neuroscience matures. Under dualism, the gap is the signature of two genuinely distinct domains standing in regular relation.

## Non-Reductive Explanation as Legitimate Science

Reduction is not the only form of scientific explanation, even within the physical sciences.

**Thermodynamics** preceded its reduction to statistical mechanics by over a century. The gas laws, the laws of heat exchange, and the principles of entropy were discovered, formalised, and used to build steam engines — all without anyone knowing that temperature was mean molecular kinetic energy. Thermodynamic explanation was genuine explanation. It identified lawful regularities, supported predictions, and enabled technological control. The later reduction to statistical mechanics added a deeper level of understanding but did not retrospectively invalidate the thermodynamic explanations.

**Phenomenological laws in physics** describe regularities without specifying underlying mechanisms. Ohm's law relates voltage, current, and resistance. It was a perfectly good scientific law for decades before electron theory explained *why* it held. The law was not a placeholder for a future reduction. It was a genuine discovery about how the world works.

**Chemistry before atomic theory** classified elements, predicted reactions, and discovered conservation principles — all without knowing what elements *were* at the fundamental level. Dalton's atomic theory eventually provided a reductive foundation, but the explanatory work of pre-atomic chemistry was not mere description awaiting real explanation.

The pattern is clear: science regularly discovers lawful regularities between domains before (and sometimes without) reducing one to the other. If consciousness and neural activity stand in lawful relations that resist reduction, this places the mind-body relationship in well-established scientific company.

## Psychophysical Laws as Scientific Discoveries

If consciousness is ontologically distinct from physical processes, the regularities connecting them constitute a new class of natural laws — [[psychophysical-laws-bridging-mind-and-matter|psychophysical laws]]. Chalmers makes the case in *The Conscious Mind* (1996): "A nonreductive theory of experience will add new principles to the furniture of the basic laws of nature."

This is not mysterianism. It is an expansion of what science investigates. The history of physics includes several such expansions. Electromagnetic phenomena required new laws beyond Newtonian mechanics. Quantum phenomena required laws that classical physics could not anticipate. Each expansion met initial resistance from those who insisted that existing frameworks were sufficient.

Psychophysical laws would specify:
- **Upward correlations**: which physical structures and processes correlate with which conscious experiences
- **Structural principles**: how the organisation of experience maps to the organisation of neural activity
- **Boundary conditions**: what physical conditions are necessary for consciousness to arise or cease

The Map's [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet adds a further category:
- **Downward selection**: how conscious states influence which physical outcomes are realised at quantum indeterminacies

Discovering these laws is an empirical project. It does not require reducing consciousness to physics any more than discovering electromagnetic laws required reducing them to mechanics.

## The Explanatory Division of Labour

Dualism clarifies rather than obscures the explanatory structure of consciousness research. Under physicalism, every aspect of consciousness must ultimately receive a physical explanation, and the persistent failure to explain phenomenal experience physically counts as a deficiency. Under dualism, the explanatory labour divides cleanly:

**Physical science explains** the neural mechanisms of perception, attention, memory, and behaviour — the "easy problems" of consciousness in Chalmers' taxonomy. These explanations are reductive and mechanistic. They are genuine and complete on their own terms.

**Psychophysical laws explain** the systematic relationship between physical structures and phenomenal experience — why *this* neural pattern correlates with *this* experience rather than some other. These explanations are non-reductive. They connect domains rather than collapsing one into the other.

**The hard problem** — why there is experience at all — may be where [[mysterianism|explanation reaches its limit]]. The question of why physical structures correlate with phenomenal experience may be as fundamental and unanswerable as the question of why the universe has the physical constants it has. A brute regularity at the base level is not a failure of science. It is where the foundations are.

This division does not mean giving up. It means recognising that different questions require different kinds of answers. The question "how does the visual cortex process colour?" has a mechanistic answer. The question "why does processed colour have a phenomenal character?" may require a different kind of answer — or may mark a genuine stopping point, as fundamental constants do in physics.

## Objections Considered

**"Non-reductive explanation is not real explanation."** This amounts to stipulating that only reduction counts as explanation — a definition that excludes thermodynamics before Boltzmann, chemistry before Dalton, and phenomenological laws throughout physics. If the definition must be narrowed to exclude consciousness, the narrowing is ad hoc.

**"Psychophysical laws are just brute correlations."** All fundamental laws are, at bottom, brute. Why does mass curve spacetime? General relativity describes the relationship without explaining *why* it holds. Psychophysical laws would be in the same position — lawful regularities without deeper explanation. This is how fundamental science always terminates.

**"Dualism provides no mechanism."** The Map's [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet proposes a candidate mechanism: consciousness biases otherwise indeterminate quantum outcomes in neural systems. Whether this specific proposal is correct, the demand for a mechanism is legitimate and dualism-compatible. The mechanism connects two domains; it need not reduce one to the other.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The Unfinishable Map interprets scientific explanation under dualism as both tractable and honest — tractable because lawful regularities between mind and brain are discoverable, honest because it does not pretend the [[explanatory-gap]] is merely a gap in current knowledge.

The [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]] tenet holds that consciousness is not reducible to physical processes. This article argues that irreducibility does not entail inexplicability. The relationship between consciousness and the physical world is lawful and investigable even if it is not a relationship of identity.

The [[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]] tenet is directly relevant. The charge that dualism is unscientific relies on treating reductive explanation as the simplest and therefore best framework. But if consciousness genuinely resists reduction — if the explanatory gap reflects ontology rather than ignorance — then the "simpler" physicalist account is simple only because it ignores what it cannot accommodate.

The [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet opens the most distinctive scientific questions. If consciousness causally influences physical outcomes, this is an empirical claim with testable implications. The search for downward causation at quantum indeterminacies is a scientific research programme, not a metaphysical retreat.
