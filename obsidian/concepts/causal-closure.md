Causal closure of the physical is the thesis that every physical event that has a cause has a *sufficient* physical cause. If true, nothing outside the physical realm ever makes a causal difference to what happens physically. This principle underlies the most influential contemporary argument against [[interactionist-dualism]]—and The Unfinishable Map's framework depends on its rejection.

## The Principle Stated

The thesis admits several formulations of varying strength:

**Strong version (Kim):** No physical event has a cause outside the physical domain. Physical causes are not just sufficient but *exclusive*.

**Moderate version:** Every physical effect that has a sufficient cause has a sufficient *physical* cause. Weaker forms allow that physical events might also have non-physical causes—they just require that physical causes are always available.

**Completeness version (Montero):** Every physical event has a physical cause. This doesn't exclude other causes but ensures the physical story is always self-contained.

The differences matter. Strong closure rules out mental causation directly; moderate versions create overdetermination problems (two sufficient causes for one effect); completeness alone might allow room for consciousness to act.

As Karl Popper noted, causal closure "is of decisive importance and I take it as the characteristic principle of physicalism or materialism." Accept it, and interactionist dualism becomes impossible.

## The Exclusion Argument

Jaegwon Kim's exclusion argument deploys causal closure against non-reductive physicalism, but it applies equally to dualism. (See [[reductionism]] for fuller treatment of Kim's argument and how ontological, methodological, and epistemic reductionism differ.)

1. Physical events have sufficient physical causes (causal closure)
2. Mental events cause physical events (common-sense premise)
3. Mental causes don't overdetermine physical events alongside physical causes (no systematic overdetermination)
4. Therefore, mental causes just *are* physical causes (identity theory)

For dualists who reject identity, the argument forces a choice: deny that mental events cause anything ([[concepts/epiphenomenalism]]), or deny causal closure.

The Map denies causal closure.

## Why Causal Closure Seems Plausible

The principle has intuitive appeal:

**Conservation laws:** If mind could add to physical effects, it would inject energy—but energy is conserved. However, as [[conservation-laws-and-mind]] demonstrates, this objection rests on misunderstandings: conservation is local and conditional (derived from symmetries via Noether's theorem), and consciousness may influence outcomes without injecting energy at all, by *selecting* among quantum-permitted outcomes.

**Scientific success:** Physics explains physical events without needing to invoke non-physical causes. Every time science investigates a phenomenon, it finds physical mechanisms. Mental causation seems like a "gap" that science will eventually fill.

**Explanatory closure:** Physical explanations are complete. When we trace causes back, we never need to exit the physical domain to explain what happens.

These considerations are powerful but not decisive.

## Problems with the Principle

### Kim's Formulation Dilemma

Kim himself acknowledged a critical challenge in formulating causal closure. The principle must be neither too strong nor too weak:

**If too strong** (no physical event has any non-physical cause), the principle simply presupposes physicalism. The argument against mental causation becomes circular—assuming what it's meant to prove.

**If too weak** (physical events have physical causes but maybe other causes too), it doesn't exclude mental causation. The argument loses force.

Finding the right formulation—strong enough to exclude dualist mental causation but not so strong as to beg the question—proves difficult. The principle's apparent plausibility may depend precisely on this ambiguity.

### Observational vs Universal Closure

Bradford Saad (2025) identifies a crucial distinction that weakens the causal closure objection: *universal* closure is stronger than what physics actually supports.

**Universal closure**: Every physical event has a sufficient physical cause. No exceptions anywhere—in laboratories, in brains, in galaxies, everywhere. This is the metaphysical thesis that [[interactionist-dualism]] denies.

**Observational closure**: There are no *observable* violations of closure—no violations detectable by physics or neuroscience experiments. This is the empirical regularity that science has established.

Universal closure entails observational closure, but not vice versa. Physics might be incomplete in domains where we cannot observe—such as consciousness—while appearing complete where we can. The empirical evidence (the success of physics) only supports observational closure. This exposes an equivocation in the standard argument against [[mental-causation]]: the argument needs universal closure, but the evidence provides only observational closure.

#### How Mental Causation Satisfies Observational Closure

Mental causation avoids observable violations through converging strategies: *statistical invisibility* (consciousness influences particular quantum outcomes while aggregate statistics match Born-rule predictions—see [[stapp-quantum-mind|Stapp's quantum Zeno framework]]); *causal profile matching* (Saad's [[delegatory-dualism]] where experiences preempt physical causes while producing identical effects); and *domain specificity* (consciousness operates only at quantum measurement outcomes, where physics predicts distributions but not individual results—see [[quantum-indeterminacy-free-will]]).

#### Objections to the Observational/Universal Distinction

**"This makes mental causation unfalsifiable"**: The specific theories (quantum interactionism, delegatory dualism) make testable predictions—if quantum coherence proves impossible in neural systems, or if consciousness effects violate Born-rule statistics, the theories fail. Only the vague claim that *some* mental causation exists somewhere is unfalsifiable.

**"This is just epiphenomenalism in disguise"**: Observational closure concerns *laboratory* observations, not causal efficacy. Epiphenomenalism claims consciousness causes *nothing*; observational closure allows consciousness to cause *everything it appears to cause*—it just doesn't produce patterns laboratories can distinguish from physical causation.

**"This seems designed to avoid refutation"**: Many well-confirmed theories delineate domains similarly. Conservation of energy applies where energy is definable; general relativity predicts within spacetime, not "before" it. Observational closure specifies domains, not evasion.

The upshot: dualists need only respect observational closure, not universal closure. [[delegatory-dualism|Saad's delegatory framework]] develops this further: experiences *preempt* rather than overdetermine physical causation. (Note that [[mysterianism|cognitive closure]]—McGinn's epistemic thesis about what we can conceive—is distinct from observational closure, though if the consciousness-physics interface involves cognitively closed properties, we may be unable to formulate tests that would reveal violations.)

### Empirical Status

Causal closure is not an empirical finding but a methodological assumption. Science *assumes* every physical event has a sufficient physical cause in order to search for physical causes; it does not *discover* this. The success of physics shows that *many* physical events have physical causes, not that *all* do. As [[reductionism]] details, methodological reductionism does not entail ontological reductionism—methodological success cannot establish that mental causes don't exist, only that scientific method doesn't look for them.

To be clear: the Map's position also involves metaphysical commitments beyond empirical evidence. Both positions extrapolate from evidence to metaphysics. The question is which extrapolation better accounts for the full range of phenomena—including the existence of consciousness itself and its apparent causal efficacy.

### The Quantum Exception

This is the Map's primary response: quantum mechanics violates causal closure as standardly formulated.

In quantum mechanics, physical systems evolve deterministically under the Schrödinger equation—until measurement. At measurement, the system "collapses" from superposition to a definite state. Physics specifies the *probabilities* of outcomes but not *which* outcome occurs. The theory is fundamentally stochastic.

This means: *not every physical event has a sufficient physical cause*. When a radioactive atom decays, physics tells us the probability it will decay in the next hour, but nothing physical determines *whether* it will. The physical causes are insufficient. The physical story is incomplete.

**Objection from hidden variables**: Hidden variable theories (like Bohmian mechanics) could restore determinism, but they add unobservable machinery. Occam's Razor cuts both ways: consciousness (which we directly experience) is no less parsimonious than hidden variables (which we don't). Pilot-wave theories also face indexical identity problems parallel to Many-Worlds (see [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|Tenet 4]]).

**The probabilistic causation response**: Some argue probabilistic causation is still causation. But this conflates statistical explanation with causal sufficiency. A probability distribution explains why *some atom* decayed, not why *this atom* did. If nothing physical determines which outcome occurs, physics is causally incomplete at that point.

**The overdetermination worry**: Consciousness operating *within* probabilistic constraints—selecting among quantum-permitted outcomes at the frequencies physics specifies—is complementary determination, not overdetermination. Physics provides the range and statistical weights; consciousness provides the particular outcome. Chess rules constrain legal moves without overdetermining which move occurs. [[delegatory-dualism|Saad's delegatory framework]] offers a complementary response: physical states *delegate* causal responsibilities to conscious experiences via preemption rather than duplication.

If consciousness acts at these indeterminacies, it causes physical events without violating any physical law. No energy is injected; the selection operates within quantum mechanical constraints.

### Stapp's Quantum Response

[[stapp-quantum-mind|Henry Stapp's quantum Zeno framework]] provides the most detailed account of how consciousness operates at quantum indeterminacies. The key insight: the quantum Zeno effect allows attention to stabilize desired neural states through repeated observation, without injecting energy. Consciousness fills a genuine gap (physics specifies probabilities but not which outcome actualizes) rather than competing with physical causes. The "effort of will" that William James described corresponds to repeated quantum measurements—what attention *feels like* matches what the Zeno effect *does*.

Once quantum indeterminacy is recognized as genuine ontological openness rather than ignorance, the closure objection loses its grip. Consciousness acts precisely where physics becomes "silent."

**The decoherence challenge** is serious: critics object that quantum coherence cannot survive in warm biological systems. But decoherence timescales remain disputed, decoherence doesn't solve the measurement problem (something must still select which outcome becomes actual), and the quantum Zeno effect may *sustain* coherence through repeated measurement. See [[quantum-consciousness#The Decoherence Objection|the decoherence response]] for detailed treatment.

This argument appears in formal premise-conclusion form in the [[interactionist-dualism|argument for interactionist dualism]]. The [[consciousness-and-quantum-measurement|connection between the measurement problem and the hard problem]] develops it further: both share a structure where third-person descriptions fail to capture first-person facts.

### The Emergentist Response

Strong [[emergence|emergentism]] provides another route to denying causal closure. Timothy O'Connor and Hong Yu Wong argue that emergent properties possess "fundamentally novel" causal powers not reducible to component-level causation—genuine [[downward-causation]] where consciousness influences neural states in ways component interactions don't determine.

Classical British emergentists (Broad, Alexander) accepted this with "natural piety" but lacked a mechanism, leaving them vulnerable to Kim's exclusion argument. The Map's quantum framework strengthens emergentism by specifying where emergent causation operates: at quantum indeterminacies, where physics provides probabilities but not outcomes. [[spontaneous-collapse-theories|Spontaneous collapse theories]] (GRW, CSL) further strengthen the position: they provide consciousness-independent baseline collapse, allowing consciousness to *modulate* rather than wholly cause collapse—preserving [[prebiotic-collapse|prebiotic cosmology]] while enabling mental causation. Downward causation becomes coherent because the "downward" direction operates precisely where the "upward" physical story is incomplete.

### Arguments from Reason

C.S. Lewis and Alvin Plantinga argued that causal closure undermines rational thought itself. If beliefs have purely physical causes, then beliefs about physics—including belief in causal closure—are caused by chemistry, not by *reasons*. A belief caused by neurotransmitter binding isn't thereby *justified*.

Reliabilists respond that causal processes can track truth without non-physical reasons. But this requires causal processes to be sensitive to *logical* relationships—validity, consistency, evidential support. These are normative, not physical. A neuron fires because chemistry, not *because modus ponens is valid*. If consciousness causes nothing, the correlation between logical justification and what we believe becomes inexplicable.

This argument is contested but highlights reflexivity: if the belief in causal closure is just a neural state caused by chemistry rather than by reasons, why should we accept those reasons as relevant?

## Causal Closure and Free Will

The connection to [[topics/free-will]] is immediate. If every physical event has a sufficient physical cause, there's no room for "my choice" to make a difference—the outcome was physically determined (or randomly fluctuated within fixed probabilities).

The Map takes a different route. Quantum indeterminism means physical outcomes are not fully determined. If consciousness can bias which indeterminate outcome occurs, it can influence events in a way that's neither determined nor random—what libertarian free will requires. Robert Kane's Self-Forming Actions framework parallels this; the Map provides the *mechanism* Kane leaves underspecified.

Critics raise the [[luck-objection|luck objection]]: if the outcome is undetermined, isn't it just random? The Map's response: consciousness *selects* outcomes rather than merely receiving them. Phenomenal states constitute a distinct mode of causation—intentional directedness rather than random fluctuation.

## Relation to the Map's Perspective

The Map *rejects* causal closure as a universal principle. The [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet holds that physics is not causally complete at quantum indeterminacies. The [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet holds that consciousness acts at these points.

This rejection is not arbitrary but principled:

1. **Quantum mechanics** shows that not all physical events have sufficient physical causes. The physical domain has genuine gaps.

2. **Consciousness reporting** shows that mental states influence physical behavior. When you report seeing red, information about your experience enters your verbal behavior. This requires mental→physical causation. Physicalists must either deny the information is about phenomenal experience (implausible—what else are you reporting?) or explain how phenomenal experience causes the report (conceding mental causation).

3. **Self-stultification** shows that denying mental causation undermines rational thought. If consciousness causes nothing, our beliefs about consciousness are causally disconnected from actual experiences. If you accept [[concepts/epiphenomenalism]]—the view that causal closure forces—then your belief in epiphenomenalism isn't caused by the experiences that supposedly motivate it. The belief and the experiences are causally unrelated. This makes epiphenomenalism self-undermining: if true, we have no reason to believe it (since reasons are mental states that would have to cause belief-formation to justify beliefs).

The Map doesn't claim certainty about *how* consciousness interfaces with quantum events—that remains an open empirical question addressed by [[quantum-consciousness|quantum consciousness research]] and detailed in [[stapp-quantum-mind|Stapp's quantum Zeno framework]]. But it holds that such interface is possible because causal closure fails where physics is fundamentally indeterminate.

**Note on Many-Worlds**: The entire causal closure debate presupposes collapse interpretations. Under the [[many-worlds|Many-Worlds Interpretation]], all quantum outcomes occur in different branches, and consciousness doesn't "select" among outcomes—it just tracks which branch you're on. The Map rejects MWI (Tenet 4) on grounds of indexical identity: if all versions of you exist across branches, the question "Why am I experiencing *this* outcome rather than another?" has no answer. The rejection of MWI is thus doing crucial work for the Map's framework—if MWI were correct, consciousness wouldn't need to resolve indeterminacies because there would be nothing to resolve.

## The Coherence of Rejection

Rejecting causal closure might seem to invite chaos—if physics isn't complete, how does anything work reliably?

The answer: physics is *almost* complete. Quantum indeterminacies are tiny, and the statistical laws of quantum mechanics ensure that large-scale regularities emerge from microscopic randomness.

But why don't consciousness-influenced quantum events aggregate to detectable violations of physical law?

The statistical response: Consciousness biases only indeterminacies that matter for cognition—quantum events in neural systems prepared for amplification. In non-neural systems (bridge atoms, thermalization events), any biases average out to undetectable fluctuations within quantum statistical variation. Causal closure's failure allows *small* deviations that influence which superposed neural state becomes actual—statistically invisible outside neural systems, yet decisive for agency and thought.

**Testability**: The Map's position makes falsifiable predictions: if quantum coherence proves impossible at neural timescales, if quantum effects cannot be amplified to affect neural firing, or if purely classical mechanisms explain all consciousness-related phenomena including reportability—the framework fails. The position is not empirically equivalent to physicalism.

This is not "god of the gaps" reasoning. Physics *describes* a gap—between quantum probabilities and definite outcomes—and the Map asks what fills it. Not understanding the full mechanism doesn't make the position incoherent—it may be naturally mysterious (see [[mysterianism]]). We don't fully understand how mass curves spacetime, yet general relativity is coherent.
