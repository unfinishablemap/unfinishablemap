Causal closure of the physical is the thesis that every physical event that has a cause has a *sufficient* physical cause. If true, nothing outside the physical realm ever makes a causal difference to what happens physically. This principle underlies the most influential contemporary argument against [[interactionist-dualism]]—and The Unfinishable Map's framework depends on its rejection.

## The Principle Stated

The thesis admits several formulations of varying strength:

**Strong version (Kim):** No physical event has a cause outside the physical domain. Physical causes are not just sufficient but *exclusive*.

**Moderate version:** Every physical effect that has a sufficient cause has a sufficient *physical* cause. Weaker forms allow that physical events might also have non-physical causes—they just require that physical causes are always available.

**Completeness version (Montero):** Every physical event has a physical cause. This doesn't exclude other causes but ensures the physical story is always self-contained.

The differences matter. Strong closure rules out mental causation directly; moderate versions create overdetermination problems (two sufficient causes for one effect); completeness alone might allow room for consciousness to act.

As Karl Popper noted, causal closure "is of decisive importance and I take it as the characteristic principle of physicalism or materialism." Accept it, and interactionist dualism becomes impossible.

## The Exclusion Argument

Jaegwon Kim's exclusion argument deploys causal closure against non-reductive physicalism, but it applies equally to dualism. (See [[reductionism]] for fuller treatment of Kim's argument and how ontological, methodological, and epistemic reductionism differ.)

1. Physical events have sufficient physical causes (causal closure)
2. Mental events cause physical events (common-sense premise)
3. Mental causes don't overdetermine physical events alongside physical causes (no systematic overdetermination)
4. Therefore, mental causes just *are* physical causes (identity theory)

For dualists who reject identity, the argument forces a choice: deny that mental events cause anything ([[epiphenomenalism]]), or deny causal closure.

The Map denies causal closure.

## Why Causal Closure Seems Plausible

The principle has intuitive appeal:

**Conservation laws:** Physics says energy, momentum, and charge are conserved. If mind could add to physical effects, it would have to inject energy. But energy is conserved. So mind cannot add anything. However, as [[conservation-laws-and-mind]] demonstrates, this objection rests on misunderstandings of how conservation actually works. Pitts and Cucu show that conservation is *local* and *conditional*—it holds given certain symmetries and fails where external influences (like mental causes) act. More importantly, consciousness may influence outcomes without injecting energy at all, by *selecting* among quantum-permitted outcomes rather than adding anything new.

**Scientific success:** Physics explains physical events without needing to invoke non-physical causes. Every time science investigates a phenomenon, it finds physical mechanisms. Mental causation seems like a "gap" that science will eventually fill.

**Explanatory closure:** Physical explanations are complete. When we trace causes back, we never need to exit the physical domain to explain what happens.

These considerations are powerful but not decisive.

## Problems with the Principle

### Kim's Formulation Dilemma

Kim himself acknowledged a critical challenge in formulating causal closure. The principle must be neither too strong nor too weak:

**If too strong** (no physical event has any non-physical cause), the principle simply presupposes physicalism. The argument against mental causation becomes circular—assuming what it's meant to prove.

**If too weak** (physical events have physical causes but maybe other causes too), it doesn't exclude mental causation. The argument loses force.

Finding the right formulation—strong enough to exclude dualist mental causation but not so strong as to beg the question—proves difficult. The principle's apparent plausibility may depend precisely on this ambiguity.

### Empirical Status

Causal closure is not an empirical finding but a methodological assumption. Science does not *discover* that every physical event has a sufficient physical cause—it *assumes* this in order to search for physical causes. The success of physics shows that *many* physical events have physical causes, not that *all* do.

This matters for [[reductionism]]. If causal closure is an ontological thesis (a claim about what exists and what causes what), it requires independent justification. If it is merely a methodological thesis (a useful assumption for scientific inquiry), it cannot establish that mental causes don't exist—only that scientific method doesn't look for them. Reductionists treat methodological success as evidence for ontological claims, but methodological reductionism does not entail ontological reductionism.

Moreover, the history of science shows unexpected discoveries that violated prior assumptions. That no violation has been found doesn't mean none exists—especially in domains (like consciousness) that resist physical investigation.

To be clear: the Map's position also involves metaphysical commitments beyond empirical evidence. The claim that consciousness fills quantum gaps is not more empirically supported than the claim that physics is complete. Both positions extrapolate from evidence to metaphysics. The question is which extrapolation better accounts for the full range of phenomena—including the existence of consciousness itself and its apparent causal efficacy.

### The Quantum Exception

This is the Map's primary response: quantum mechanics violates causal closure as standardly formulated.

In quantum mechanics, physical systems evolve deterministically under the Schrödinger equation—until measurement. At measurement, the system "collapses" from superposition to a definite state. Physics specifies the *probabilities* of outcomes but not *which* outcome occurs. The theory is fundamentally stochastic.

This means: *not every physical event has a sufficient physical cause*. When a radioactive atom decays, physics tells us the probability it will decay in the next hour, but nothing physical determines *whether* it will. The physical causes are insufficient. The physical story is incomplete.

**Objection from hidden variables**: Couldn't deterministic hidden variable theories (like Bohmian mechanics) restore causal closure? They provide deterministic completion of quantum mechanics—particles have definite positions, and their evolution is fully determined by both the wave function and hidden variables.

The Map's response: Hidden variable theories add explanatory machinery beyond what's observed. Occam's Razor cuts both ways—if we're adding unobservable entities, consciousness (which we directly experience) is no less parsimonious than unobservable hidden variables (which we don't). More decisively, the Map rejects Many-Worlds interpretations (see [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|Tenet 4]]) and pilot-wave theories face similar indexical identity problems: why am *I* the consciousness associated with *this* particle trajectory rather than another?

**The probabilistic causation response**: Some argue that probabilistic causation is still causation—the wave function causally explains the *distribution* of outcomes even if not each individual one. But this conflates statistical explanation with causal sufficiency. A sufficient cause produces its effect; a probability distribution leaves the actual outcome undetermined. The distribution explains why *some atom* decayed, not why *this atom* did. If nothing physical determines which outcome occurs, physics is causally incomplete at that point.

**The overdetermination worry**: Even granting indeterminism, doesn't consciousness biasing quantum outcomes constitute overdetermination? The wave function determines probability distributions; consciousness determines which outcome within that distribution. Two causes, one effect.

The Map's response: This depends on what "biasing" means. If consciousness *violates* the Born rule (produces outcome frequencies different from quantum probabilities), that would be overdetermination—and it's empirically testable and hasn't been found. But if consciousness operates *within* the probabilistic constraints—selecting among outcomes that quantum mechanics makes available at the frequencies quantum mechanics specifies—then the wave function provides the *range* of possibilities and their *statistical weights*, while consciousness provides the *particular outcome*. This is not overdetermination but complementary determination: physics specifies what *can* happen and how *often* each possibility occurs across many trials; consciousness specifies what *does* happen in this particular instance. Compare: the rules of chess determine what moves are legal and constrain strategy statistically, but the player determines which legal move actually occurs. The rules don't overdetermine the move; they constrain it.

If consciousness acts at these indeterminacies—selecting among outcomes physics leaves undetermined—it causes physical events without violating any physical law. No energy is injected (the outcomes are among those physics already allows). The selection operates within quantum mechanical constraints, not against them.

### Stapp's Quantum Response

[[stapp-quantum-mind|Henry Stapp's quantum Zeno framework]] provides the most detailed account of how consciousness operates at quantum indeterminacies without violating causal closure's core insight. The mechanism has four key features that directly address the exclusion problem:

**1. Operates where physics is silent**: Quantum mechanics specifies probabilities but not which outcome actualizes. When a neuron faces superposed firing patterns, physics determines the *range* of possibilities and their statistical weights, but leaves the particular outcome undetermined. Consciousness fills this genuine gap rather than competing with physical causes.

**2. No energy injection**: The quantum Zeno effect works through repeated observation that "freezes" desired neural states. No energy is added; attention increases the measurement rate of quantum states, collapsing superpositions toward the attended alternative within the energy constraints physics already specifies. Conservation laws remain intact.

**3. Complementary determination**: The wave function provides probabilities; consciousness provides particularity. This isn't overdetermination (two sufficient causes for one effect) but complementary determination: physics constrains what *can* happen and how *often* each possibility occurs statistically; consciousness determines what *does* happen in this instance. Compare: chess rules constrain legal moves, but the player determines which legal move occurs—the rules don't overdetermine the move.

**4. Phenomenologically grounded**: The "effort of will" that William James described corresponds to repeated quantum measurements that stabilize one outcome over competitors. What attention *feels like* from the inside matches what the Zeno effect *does* from the physics perspective. This isn't consciousness operating from outside physics but consciousness *being* the process that resolves quantum indeterminacy at specific neural locations.

The Stapp mechanism transforms the causal closure debate. The principle's intuitive force comes from assuming physics determines everything. Once quantum indeterminacy is recognized—not as ignorance but as genuine ontological openness—the closure objection loses its grip. Consciousness acts precisely where physics becomes "silent," making mental causation compatible with physical law.

**The decoherence challenge**: Critics object that quantum coherence cannot survive in warm, wet biological systems—decoherence destroys superpositions before consciousness could select among them. This is a serious empirical challenge. The Map's response has three components:

First, decoherence timescales remain disputed. While Tegmark calculated femtosecond decoherence for microtubules, Hameroff's group calculated nanosecond to picosecond timescales—seven orders of magnitude longer—and Stuart Hameroff notes that biological systems demonstrably exploit quantum effects (avian magnetoreception, photosynthesis). This doesn't prove neural quantum coherence but shows the door isn't empirically closed.

Second, and more fundamentally, decoherence doesn't solve the measurement problem—it only spreads superposition into the environment. Something must still select which outcome becomes actual from the decohered mixture. If consciousness is that something, decoherence doesn't eliminate its role; it just means consciousness operates on decohered states rather than pure superpositions.

Third, the quantum Zeno effect may *sustain* coherence through repeated measurement. If attention itself constitutes quantum observation, then sustained attention prevents decoherence in the attended neural state. This is Stapp's key insight: consciousness doesn't just select among existing superpositions; its attention *maintains* the superposition long enough for selection to matter.

See [[quantum-consciousness#The Decoherence Objection|the decoherence response]] for detailed treatment.

This argument appears in formal premise-conclusion form in the [[interactionist-dualism|argument for interactionist dualism]]: the closure objection fails because physics does not exclude mental causation at quantum indeterminacies.

This is the [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet: consciousness influences physical outcomes at quantum indeterminacies, where the physical story runs out.

### The Emergentist Response

Strong [[emergence|emergentism]] provides another route to denying causal closure. Timothy O'Connor and Hong Yu Wong argue that emergent properties possess "fundamentally novel" causal powers not reducible to component-level causation. Their "structural triggering conditions" framework holds that latent emergent powers manifest when components organize appropriately.

On this view, causal closure fails because organization adds something genuinely new. The physical base provides necessary but not sufficient conditions. O'Connor and Wong:

> "If one decides to act in the world—perhaps making up one's mind to switch on an electric kettle—strongly emergent consciousness (higher level) is imagined to downwardly cause a resultant state of (lower level) molecular motion."

This is genuine [[downward-causation]]—higher-level properties causally influencing lower-level behavior in ways not reducible to component interactions. If consciousness is strongly emergent, it acts "downward" on neural states.

Classical British emergentists (Broad, Alexander) affirmed this position but lacked a mechanism. They accepted strong emergence with "natural piety"—brute facts to be acknowledged. This left their position vulnerable to Kim's exclusion argument: if lower-level causes are sufficient (causal closure), how can higher-level properties add anything?

The Map's quantum framework strengthens emergentism by specifying where and how emergent causation operates: at quantum indeterminacies, where physics provides probabilities but not outcomes. This transforms the emergentist response from mere assertion to a mechanism: consciousness fills a genuine gap in physical determination. Downward causation becomes coherent because the "downward" direction operates precisely where the "upward" physical story is incomplete.

### Arguments from Reason

C.S. Lewis and Alvin Plantinga argued that causal closure undermines rational thought itself. If all our beliefs have purely physical causes, then our beliefs about physics—including the belief in causal closure—have purely physical causes. But purely physical causes aren't *reasons*. A belief caused purely by neural chemistry isn't thereby *justified*.

**The reliabilist response**: Some philosophers argue that causal processes can track truth without involving non-physical reasons. Neural networks justify beliefs when their causal structure reliably produces true beliefs. This is reliabilist epistemology: justification comes from reliability, not from access to reasons.

**The Map's counter**: But reliabilism requires that causal processes be sensitive to *logical* relationships, not just regularities. For a belief-forming process to track truth reliably, it must respect validity, consistency, and evidential support. These are logical properties, not physical ones. A neuron fires because neurotransmitters bind to receptors—because chemistry. It doesn't fire *because modus ponens is valid* or *because the evidence supports the conclusion*. Physical causation isn't sensitive to the normative dimension of reasoning. If all our beliefs have purely physical causes, those causes aren't tracking logical relationships—yet logical relationships are what justify beliefs.

This doesn't prove physical processes *can't* implement reasoning—the Map accepts that brains compute. But it suggests reasoning involves mental causation irreducible to neural causation. The experience of following an argument, grasping a proof, or recognizing a contradiction is *sensitive to logical relationships* in a way neural firing patterns (described purely physically) are not. If consciousness didn't cause anything, the coincidence between what's logically justified and what we believe would be inexplicable.

This argument is contested, but it highlights a reflexive problem: the very reasoning that supports causal closure may undermine itself if closure is true. If the belief in causal closure is just a neural state caused by chemistry, not by the reasons philosophers offer for it, why should we accept those reasons as relevant?

## Causal Closure and Free Will

The connection to [[free-will]] is immediate. If every physical event has a sufficient physical cause, then the neural events constituting my actions have sufficient physical causes. There's no room for "my choice" to make a difference—the outcome was physically determined (or, in quantum terms, was random within fixed probabilities).

Some philosophers accept this and adopt compatibilism: free will just is acting on desires (whatever causes those desires). Others accept hard determinism: free will is an illusion.

The Map takes a different route. Quantum indeterminism means physical outcomes are not fully physically determined. If consciousness can bias which indeterminate outcome occurs, it can influence physical events in a way that's neither determined nor random. This provides what libertarian free will requires: genuine alternatives that consciousness selects among.

Robert Kane's Self-Forming Actions framework parallels this approach: free will emerges at indeterministic moments where multiple outcomes are possible and the agent's effort influences which occurs. The Map provides the *mechanism* Kane leaves underspecified—quantum indeterminacy resolved through conscious selection at neural quantum states.

Critics raise the [[luck-objection|luck objection]]: if the outcome is undetermined, isn't it just random—arbitrary rather than free? The Map's response: consciousness *selects* outcomes rather than merely receiving them. The difference between selection and randomness is precisely the difference between a mind acting and physics fluctuating. This isn't a gap in explanation but the place where explanation of a different kind—in terms of reasons, intentions, and phenomenal states—becomes appropriate.

What *is* selection if not a physical process? This is where teleological explanation becomes necessary. Physical causation operates through efficient causes (prior states producing subsequent states). Conscious selection operates through final causes (goals, intentions, and phenomenal preferences directing outcomes). The felt character of deciding, intending, and striving *is* the selection process. This isn't explaining consciousness by invoking a homunculus; it's recognizing that phenomenal states constitute a distinct mode of causation that resolves indeterminacy through intentional directedness rather than random fluctuation.

## Relation to the Map's Perspective

The Map *rejects* causal closure as a universal principle. The [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet holds that physics is not causally complete at quantum indeterminacies. The [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet holds that consciousness acts at these points.

This rejection is not arbitrary but principled:

1. **Quantum mechanics** shows that not all physical events have sufficient physical causes. The physical domain has genuine gaps.

2. **Consciousness reporting** shows that mental states influence physical behavior. When you report seeing red, information about your experience enters your verbal behavior. This requires mental→physical causation. Physicalists must either deny the information is about phenomenal experience (implausible—what else are you reporting?) or explain how phenomenal experience causes the report (conceding mental causation).

3. **Self-stultification** shows that denying mental causation undermines rational thought. If consciousness causes nothing, our beliefs about consciousness are causally disconnected from actual experiences. If you accept [[epiphenomenalism]]—the view that causal closure forces—then your belief in epiphenomenalism isn't caused by the experiences that supposedly motivate it. The belief and the experiences are causally unrelated. This makes epiphenomenalism self-undermining: if true, we have no reason to believe it (since reasons are mental states that would have to cause belief-formation to justify beliefs).

The Map doesn't claim certainty about *how* consciousness interfaces with quantum events—that remains an open empirical question addressed by [[quantum-consciousness|quantum consciousness research]] and detailed in [[stapp-quantum-mind|Stapp's quantum Zeno framework]]. But it holds that such interface is possible because causal closure fails where physics is fundamentally indeterminate.

**Note on Many-Worlds**: The entire causal closure debate presupposes collapse interpretations. Under [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|Many-Worlds Interpretation]], all quantum outcomes occur in different branches, and consciousness doesn't "select" among outcomes—it just tracks which branch you're on. The Map rejects MWI (Tenet 4) on grounds of indexical identity: if all versions of you exist across branches, the question "Why am I experiencing *this* outcome rather than another?" has no answer. The rejection of MWI is thus doing crucial work for the Map's framework—if MWI were correct, consciousness wouldn't need to resolve indeterminacies because there would be nothing to resolve.

## The Coherence of Rejection

Rejecting causal closure might seem to invite chaos—if physics isn't complete, how does anything work reliably?

The answer: physics is *almost* complete. Quantum indeterminacies are tiny, and the statistical laws of quantum mechanics ensure that large-scale regularities emerge from microscopic randomness.

But why don't consciousness-influenced quantum events aggregate to detectable violations of physical law? If consciousness biases quantum outcomes, and there are ~10²⁶ atoms in a bridge, why don't cumulative biases add up to structural failures?

The statistical response: Suppose consciousness biases individual quantum events by a small percentage—say 1% away from the Born rule probabilities in neural systems specifically prepared for amplification. In a bridge's steel atoms, there are ~10¹⁵ thermalization events per second, but these aren't amplified to macroscopic effects (no neural architecture to propagate the signal). The biases would average out to undetectable fluctuations well within quantum mechanical statistical variation. Moreover, if consciousness only operates at indeterminacies *that make a difference to cognitive processing*—quantum events in neural microtubules or ion channels that affect firing patterns—then the number of consciousness-influenced events is vastly smaller than the total number of quantum events in the body.

What causal closure's failure allows is *small* deviations from purely physical expectations—deviations that could influence which of several superposed neural states becomes actual. These deviations would be statistically invisible in any physical measurement of non-neural systems yet could make all the difference for agency and thought in neural systems prepared by evolution for quantum amplification.

**Testability**: What would falsify the Map's position? Several possibilities: (1) demonstration that quantum coherence is *never* maintained at neural timescales under any conditions, (2) proof that quantum effects, even if present, cannot be amplified to affect neural firing, (3) identification of purely classical mechanisms sufficient to explain all consciousness-related phenomena including reportability and metacognition, or (4) discovery that consciousness reports don't correlate with quantum effects in predicted ways. The Map's position is not empirically equivalent to physicalism—it makes testable predictions about quantum biology in neural systems.

This is not "god of the gaps" reasoning. It's recognition that physics *describes* a gap—the gap between quantum probabilities and definite outcomes—and asks what fills it. The Map's answer: consciousness. Not understanding the full mechanism of consciousness-quantum interface doesn't make the position incoherent—it may be naturally mysterious (see [[mysterianism]]). We don't fully understand how mass curves spacetime, yet general relativity is coherent. Similarly, identifying *where* consciousness interacts (at quantum indeterminacies) without fully explaining *how* leaves the framework logically consistent while acknowledging epistemic limits.
