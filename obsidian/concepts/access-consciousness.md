Access consciousness (A-consciousness) is information that is "poised for global control"—available for reasoning, verbal report, and rational guidance of action. Ned Block introduced the term in 1995 to isolate the functional aspect of consciousness from [[phenomenal-consciousness|phenomenal consciousness]] (P-consciousness), the "what it's like" quality of experience. This distinction reveals what physicalist theories can explain (access mechanisms) versus what remains puzzling (phenomenal properties).

The distinction matters for [[tenets#^dualism|dualism]] because it shows that acknowledging consciousness's functional role doesn't eliminate the [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|hard problem]]. Blindsight demonstrates access without phenomenology; the overflow argument suggests phenomenology without full access. Access consciousness is real and causally important, but it cannot be all there is to consciousness.

## Defining Access Consciousness {#definition}

Block's original formulation: "A representation is access conscious if it is poised for global control—that is, poised for free use in reasoning and for direct 'rational' control of action (including reporting in speech) and reasoning."

Key features:

1. **Availability**: The information must be available to multiple cognitive systems, not confined to specialized processors
2. **Rational control**: It can guide deliberate action and explicit reasoning
3. **Reportability**: The subject can typically describe the content in speech or thought (though reportability is consequence, not definition)
4. **Functional role**: A-consciousness is defined by what information *does*, not what it *feels like*

### What Counts as Access Conscious

- A visual perception that you can describe and reason about
- An occurrent thought that guides your next action
- A memory you're currently retrieving for decision-making
- Information in [[working-memory|working memory]] available for executive processes

### What Might Not Be Access Conscious

- Subliminal stimuli that affect behavior without awareness
- Information in iconic memory before you attend to it
- Procedural knowledge guiding automatic actions
- Blindsight information that patients can "guess" but can't access for normal reasoning

The boundaries are contested—these examples drive debates about dissociations between access and phenomenology (explained below in [[#dissociations]]).

## The Access/Phenomenal Distinction {#distinction}

Block's 1995 paper "On a Confusion about a Function of Consciousness" argued that philosophers and scientists routinely conflate two concepts:

**Access consciousness**: Information available for reasoning, report, and action
**[[Phenomenal-consciousness|Phenomenal consciousness]]**: What it's like to be in a mental state—the subjective, experiential quality

The confusion has "bad results" because functions of the access-machinery get "illicitly transferred" to phenomenal consciousness. For example, blindsight patients cannot use information about stimuli in their blind field for normal reasoning (access deficit), and we conclude phenomenal consciousness must be necessary for guiding action. But this confuses what access-mechanisms do with what phenomenal properties do.

### Why the Distinction Matters

**For consciousness science**: [[Global-workspace-theory|Global Workspace Theory]] explains when information becomes A-conscious (global broadcast) but says nothing about why this broadcast feels like anything. Dehaene and Changeux's Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW) identifies neural mechanisms for access—prefrontal-parietal ignition—without addressing P-consciousness. The theory succeeds at what it attempts (access) while leaving the [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|hard problem]] untouched.

**For dualism**: Acknowledging A-consciousness *strengthens* rather than weakens the dualist position. Physicalism can plausibly explain access-mechanisms through neural architecture and information integration. What remains inexplicable is why globally broadcast information feels like anything. The [[explanatory-gap|explanatory gap]] persists even after we understand access.

**For AI consciousness**: Systems might be A-conscious (information poised for reasoning, report, action control) without being P-conscious (having phenomenal experience). The [[substrate-independence-critique|substrate critique]] applies: if consciousness involves irreducible phenomenal properties, functional similarity (matching access architecture) doesn't guarantee phenomenology. See [[ai-consciousness]].

## Dissociations: Access Without Phenomenology, Phenomenology Without Access {#dissociations}

Block argues A-consciousness and P-consciousness can dissociate in both directions. If they sometimes come apart, they cannot be identical.

### Blindsight: Access Without Phenomenology?

Blindsight patients have cortical damage (typically V1) causing a blind spot in their visual field. They report seeing nothing in the blind field—no phenomenology. Yet they can "guess" stimulus properties with accuracy far above chance: location, motion, even color.

**The access interpretation**: Blindsight involves *some* information reaching cognitive systems (enabling forced-choice guessing) but not full global access (not available for free use in reasoning and action). Patients can't use the information naturally; they must be prompted to guess. This is degraded access, not full A-consciousness.

**The phenomenology question**: Is there degraded phenomenology matching the degraded access? Block's original point: blindsight shows that access-machinery does certain work (enabling action guidance when information is broadcast). We can't automatically conclude that phenomenal consciousness does that work.

**Dualist reading**: Blindsight may represent minimal or absent P-consciousness despite partial access. If so, the dissociation supports the claim that access and phenomenology are distinct. However, blindsight is controversial—some theorists argue residual phenomenology exists but patients don't notice it or can't report it. See [[philosophical-zombies]] for whether access without phenomenology is metaphysically possible.

### The Overflow Argument: Phenomenology Without Full Access

Block's overflow argument holds that phenomenal consciousness has richer content than access consciousness—we experience more than we can report or think about.

**Sperling's iconic memory experiment** (1960): Flash a grid of 12 letters for 50 milliseconds. Subjects can report only 4-5 letters. But if you cue them immediately after (tone indicating which row to report), they can report any row with high accuracy. Subjects consistently report "I saw all 12 letters but couldn't hold them all in memory."

**Block's interpretation**: Subjects must have had phenomenal consciousness of all 12 letters—that's what's being consulted when the cue directs attention to a specific row. But only 4-5 letters are A-conscious at once (available for reasoning and report without the cue). Therefore, P-consciousness overflows A-consciousness.

**Implications for the distinction**:
- If overflow is real, phenomenal richness exceeds what global workspace mechanisms make accessible
- [[Global-workspace-theory|GWT]] might explain access while missing the fuller phenomenology
- P-consciousness cannot reduce to A-consciousness if P has higher capacity than A

**The deflationary response**: Critics—notably Dennett and Cohen—argue that the experience of "seeing all 12" is itself a report/judgment (thus A-conscious), and the letters not currently reportable aren't genuinely P-conscious either. On this view, subjects don't experience all 12 letters; they experience a *gestalt impression* of "lots of letters" that becomes specific only when the cue directs attention. The "overflow" is confabulation—retroactively attributing rich phenomenology that wasn't there. This deflationary interpretation deserves serious consideration: if the phenomenal richness exists only in reconstruction rather than original experience, the overflow argument fails.

The debate remains unresolved, though recent work adds complexity. Nartker et al. (2025) found that "inattentionally blind" participants retain visual sensitivity to stimuli they explicitly deny noticing—they can report location, colour, and shape of objects they claim not to have seen. This suggests phenomenology may persist even when workspace broadcast fails, supporting overflow. But deflationary theorists can respond that this residual sensitivity reflects degraded access rather than rich phenomenology. See [[global-workspace-theory#the-accessphenomenal-distinction]].

### A-Consciousness Without P-Consciousness?

Can mental states be A-conscious without phenomenal character? Block thinks yes: occurrent thoughts and judgments are available for reasoning and action (A-conscious) but may lack "what it's like" quality.

**Example**: The thought "Paris is the capital of France" is A-conscious when you're using it in reasoning. But is there phenomenology of entertaining this proposition? What is it *like* to think "Paris is the capital of France"?

**Two positions**:
1. **No cognitive phenomenology**: Only sensory/emotional states have P-consciousness; thoughts are A-conscious only
2. **Cognitive phenomenology exists**: There is something it's like to understand, doubt, judge—distinct from sensory phenomenology but phenomenal nonetheless

This debate connects to [[cognitive-phenomenology]]—whether thinking itself has experiential character. If pure thoughts are A-conscious without P-consciousness, the dissociation holds in this direction too.

## Access Consciousness and Functionalism {#functionalism}

[[Functionalism]] defines mental states by their causal-functional roles: what causes them, what they cause, how they relate to other mental states. Access consciousness fits naturally into functionalist frameworks—it's defined by its functional role (availability for reasoning, report, action).

This is why [[global-workspace-theory|Global Workspace Theory]] succeeds as a theory of A-consciousness. GWT explains *when* information becomes A-conscious (upon global broadcast) and *how* this happens (ignition across prefrontal-parietal networks). These are functional explanations: describing mechanisms that make information available.

**The limitation**: Functionalism struggles with [[phenomenal-consciousness|P-consciousness]]. The [[inverted-qualia|inverted qualia]] objection shows that phenomenology might vary while functional role stays constant. The [[philosophical-zombies|zombie argument]] suggests that functional organization might exist without phenomenology. These objections don't apply to A-consciousness—functional role is precisely what A-consciousness is. See [[arguments/functionalism]] for the full case against functionalist accounts of P-consciousness.

**For dualism**: We can grant that A-consciousness is functionally explicable while maintaining that P-consciousness is not. This strengthens the dualist position by isolating precisely what remains unexplained. The [[explanatory-gap|explanatory gap]] applies to phenomenal properties, not to access mechanisms.

## The Role of Attention {#attention}

[[Attention]] is intimately connected to access consciousness, though the exact relationship is debated.

**Are attention and A-consciousness identical?** Not quite. Attention is the mechanism that *selects* what enters the global workspace; A-consciousness is the state of being in the workspace. But they're closely linked:

- Attended information typically becomes A-conscious
- Inattentional blindness shows that unattended information may not reach full access
- [[Voluntary-attention|Voluntary attention]] enables deliberate control over what becomes accessible

**Block's overflow argument revisited**: If overflow is real, attention might select what becomes A-conscious from a richer phenomenal field. Attention doesn't create P-consciousness but determines what reaches the access-machinery. This fits the dualist view: phenomenal consciousness exists in parallel with functional access, and attention is the bridge.

**Stapp's quantum mechanism**: [[Stapp-quantum-mind|Henry Stapp's model]] proposes that [[attention-as-interface|attention is the interface]] where consciousness influences physical processes. On this view—which remains speculative and contested among physicists—attention operates through the quantum Zeno effect: sustained observation that selects among potential outcomes. The connection to A-consciousness: attention determines what information is "held" in the global workspace long enough for reasoning and action. Attention is the voluntary control mechanism for A-consciousness. See [[motor-selection]] for how this plays out in action selection.

## Access Consciousness and Dualist Interaction {#interaction}

If [[tenets#^bidirectional|consciousness causally influences the brain]], it must work through some mechanism. Access consciousness is plausibly part of that mechanism.

**The interface role**: Consciousness influences action by determining what information is A-conscious—what's available to guide reasoning and behavior. This doesn't require that P-consciousness *is* A-consciousness, only that P-consciousness operates *through* A-consciousness machinery.

**Two-stage model**:
1. **Phenomenal stage**: Rich experiential field (P-consciousness) that may overflow what's currently accessed
2. **Access stage**: Attention selects what enters the global workspace (A-consciousness), making it available for reasoning, report, action

Conscious influence operates at stage 2: by modulating attention, consciousness determines what becomes A-conscious. [[Stapp-quantum-mind|Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism]] provides a concrete proposal: sustained attention (rapid repeated observations) biases quantum indeterminacies in neural firing, selecting which patterns stabilize. This controls what information achieves global broadcast.

**Why this preserves dualism**: The selection process (what becomes A-conscious) cannot be fully explained by prior physical states if consciousness genuinely intervenes. The *machinery* of access (global workspace, prefrontal-parietal networks) is physical, but what *drives* the selection may be phenomenal consciousness operating through quantum-level interactions. See [[causal-closure]] for how this avoids violating conservation laws.

**Free will connection**: Libertarian free will requires that agents genuinely select among alternatives. A-consciousness is where these alternatives become explicit—available for deliberation and choice. [[Phenomenology-of-choice|The phenomenology of choice]] includes experiencing options, deliberating, "gathering oneself" to act. This is the phenomenology of the access-machinery in operation, with consciousness determining what gets accessed and ultimately acted upon. See [[free-will]] and Kane's account of self-forming actions.

## Relation to Site Perspective {#tenets}

### Dualism

Access consciousness reveals what physicalism *can* explain: functional availability, information integration, global broadcast. [[Global-workspace-theory|Global Workspace Theory]] succeeds at this task. What remains inexplicable is [[phenomenal-consciousness|why global broadcast feels like anything]]. By isolating A-consciousness as the functional aspect, we clarify that the [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|hard problem]] concerns P-consciousness specifically.

The [[explanatory-gap|explanatory gap]] persists: neural mechanisms for access don't bridge to phenomenology. Knowing that information achieved prefrontal-parietal ignition doesn't tell us why there's "something it's like" to have that information broadcast. [[Arguments/functionalism|Arguments against functionalism]] show that functional role cannot capture phenomenal properties. This persistent gap—despite decades of sophisticated neuroscientific work—may reflect a [[mysterianism-cognitive-closure|cognitive closure]] on our part, or it may indicate a genuine ontological distinction. Either possibility resists physicalist resolution.

Block's dissociations strengthen dualism: if access and phenomenology can come apart, they're distinct. Blindsight suggests access without phenomenology; overflow suggests phenomenology exceeding access. If P-consciousness isn't reducible to A-consciousness, and A-consciousness is functionally explicable, then P-consciousness requires non-physical explanation.

### Bidirectional Interaction

If consciousness influences behavior, it must work through access mechanisms. Phenomenal consciousness determines what becomes A-conscious via [[attention-as-interface|attention as interface]]. [[Stapp-quantum-mind|Stapp's model]] proposes the quantum Zeno effect: sustained attention (repeated rapid observations) biases which neural patterns stabilize, controlling what information achieves global broadcast and guides action.

A-consciousness is the *functional expression* of conscious influence. We can't directly observe phenomenal consciousness influencing neurons, but we can observe information becoming accessible for reasoning and action in ways that correlate with phenomenology. The causal pathway: P-consciousness → attention → A-consciousness → action. See [[mental-causation]] for how non-physical phenomenal properties exert causal influence through physical attention mechanisms.

### Minimal Quantum Interaction

Access mechanisms are the "downstream" neural processes that amplify initial quantum-level interventions. Consciousness doesn't need to control the entire global workspace—only the quantum indeterminacies that determine what gets selected for broadcast. [[Stapp-quantum-mind|Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism]] proposes that attention operates at quantum collapse events in neural firing. Once a pattern is selected, classical neural dynamics handle the global broadcast (A-consciousness).

This preserves minimalism: consciousness intervenes at quantum indeterminacies, and the access-machinery amplifies that selection into macro-scale functional availability. The energy-conservation objection dissolves because no energy is injected—consciousness selects among possibilities that physics leaves undetermined. This proposal remains speculative, though it provides a coherent framework for how minimal interaction could have macro-scale effects. See [[causal-closure#stapps-quantum-response]] and [[conservation-laws-and-mind]].

### No Many Worlds

The [[many-worlds|Many Worlds Interpretation]] of quantum mechanics implies that all possible outcomes occur across branches. If consciousness operates through quantum selection (as Stapp proposes), MWI threatens to make that selection illusory—you experience the outcome on your branch, but other versions of you experience other outcomes on other branches.

**MWI proponents respond** with self-locating uncertainty: before measurement, you don't know which branch you'll find yourself on, so subjective probability still applies. The Deutsch-Wallace decision-theoretic approach derives the Born rule from rational constraints on branching. On this view, "which branch am I on?" is a meaningful question with a definite answer given by observation.

**The dualist objection**: Self-locating uncertainty presupposes what it needs to explain. It requires a determinate "I" whose location is uncertain. But MWI's ontology contains only wave functions evolving deterministically—no primitive fact about which branch contains *you*. The uncertainty is indexed to a subject whose identity the theory cannot ground. See [[indexical-identity-quantum-measurement]] for detailed analysis.

Access consciousness is where this becomes existentially urgent. When you deliberate between options, those options are A-conscious: represented explicitly, available for reasoning. When you choose, one option becomes A-conscious in a stronger sense: it guides action, enters [[episodic-memory|episodic memory]], shapes your future self. If MWI is true, there's no fact about which option *you* chose—all versions happened to different "yous."

The connection: A-consciousness reveals which selection occurred for *this* subject. If MWI eliminates the fact of the matter about which outcome happened, it eliminates the fact of the matter about what's A-conscious for you. The indexical question "Why do I experience this option becoming A-conscious rather than that one?" cannot be answered by "Both became A-conscious on different branches"—that's no answer for the subject asking the question. See [[haecceity]] for the metaphysics of "this-ness."

### Occam's Razor Has Limits

Two leading neuroscientific theories attempt to explain consciousness in purely physical terms:

1. **[[Global-workspace-theory|Global Workspace Theory]]**: Consciousness is global broadcast enabling access
2. **[[Integrated-information-theory|Integrated Information Theory]]**: Consciousness is integrated information (Φ)

GWT successfully explains A-consciousness but leaves P-consciousness unexplained. IIT attempts to address P-consciousness but faces its own difficulties (panpsychism implications, implausible predictions about cerebellum). The 2025 [[global-workspace-theory#the-cogitate-experiment|COGITATE adversarial collaboration]] found that neither theory fully captured the phenomena—both made incorrect predictions.

The situation illustrates [[tenets#^occams-limits|the limits of Occam's Razor]]. Physicalist theories are simpler (one substance) but struggle with consciousness. Dualism is more complex (two substances) but handles both access (functional) and phenomenology (irreducible). When simpler theories persistently fail to explain the target phenomenon, simplicity stops being a reliable guide. The A-consciousness / P-consciousness distinction shows *what* physicalism can explain (access) and *what* it cannot (phenomenology), clarifying why dualism remains necessary despite being ontologically more complex.

## Illusionist Challenge

[[Illusionism]] argues that phenomenal consciousness is an illusion—we're mistaken in thinking there's "something it's like" beyond functional access. On this view, A-consciousness is all there is; the appearance of P-consciousness as something additional is a cognitive error.

**The illusionist move**: When you think "there's what it's like to see red," that thought is A-conscious (available for report), and the seeming phenomenology is just the introspective access to your color-processing states. The "redness" is how your color-detection system represents itself to your reporting mechanisms, not a genuine phenomenal property.

**Response from dualism**: Illusionism must explain away the most obvious datum of consciousness—that experience has a qualitative character. The move requires that we be systematically deceived about our own mental states. But introspection gives us *direct* acquaintance with phenomenology; denying this is more radical than accepting dualism.

Moreover, the distinction between A-consciousness and P-consciousness itself refutes illusionism. If P-consciousness were just how A-consciousness seems to introspection, the overflow argument couldn't get off the ground—there'd be nothing to overflow. But Sperling's experiment and inattentional blindness research suggest phenomenology exceeds what's accessed. Illusionism would predict that phenomenology = what's reportable (A-conscious), but the empirical evidence challenges that equation.

See [[qualia]] for the positive case that phenomenal properties are real, and [[philosophical-zombies]] for why conceivability arguments support this.

## Process Philosophy Perspective

Process philosophy (in the tradition of Whitehead) emphasizes becoming over being, relations over substances. From this view, access consciousness is the *relational aspect* of consciousness—how a moment of experience is *related to* subsequent cognitive processes (reasoning, action, memory).

An experience becomes A-conscious not by having an intrinsic access-property, but by entering into certain relations: it flows into working memory, it shapes motor preparation, it becomes available for verbal report. These relations are real—they constitute what Block is tracking. But they're not identical to the experiential moment itself (P-consciousness).

**Whitehead's distinction**: An occasion of experience has both *subjective immediacy* (what it's like in its happening) and *objective immortality* (how it becomes datum for subsequent occasions). P-consciousness is subjective immediacy; A-consciousness is the beginning of objective immortality—when the experience becomes available to future cognitive processes.

**Implications**: This dissolves the worry that P-consciousness would be "causally inert" if distinct from A-consciousness. The distinction isn't between phenomenology and function, but between the immediacy of experiencing and the relational availability that flows from experiencing. Both are aspects of the same concrete process. Consciousness is always both phenomenal (in its immediacy) and functional (in its consequences), though the aspects are conceptually distinct.

**Causal account**: On the process view, A-consciousness is what happens when a phenomenal occasion successfully *prehends* (grasps and incorporates) previous occasions in ways that make their content available for future occasions. Attention is the mode of prehension that selects which aspects of previous experience will be strongly incorporated (made A-conscious) versus weakly incorporated (background phenomenology without full access).
