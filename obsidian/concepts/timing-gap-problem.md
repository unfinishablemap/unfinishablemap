The timing gap problem is the mismatch between quantum decoherence timescales and neural decision timescales. Tegmark (2000) calculated that quantum superpositions in neural systems collapse in approximately 10⁻¹³ seconds (femtoseconds), while conscious neural decisions operate at 200-550 milliseconds. This twelve-order-of-magnitude gap poses a direct challenge to any theory proposing that consciousness interacts with the brain through quantum mechanics: if superpositions vanish trillions of times faster than neurons decide, quantum effects cannot meaningfully influence neural outcomes.

The timing gap is The Unfinishable Map's most important empirical challenge. The Map's [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet holds that consciousness biases quantum indeterminacies in the brain. If the relevant quantum states collapse before neural processes can register them, this tenet faces a serious difficulty. For comprehensive treatment of the timing hierarchy and mechanism-specific responses, see [[quantum-neural-timing-constraints]].

## The Gap Defined

Two timescales must connect for quantum consciousness theories to work:

**Quantum side.** Decoherence destroys superpositions through environmental interaction. In warm, wet biological tissue, thermal noise causes rapid decoherence. Tegmark modelled both regular neuron firing (involving ion channels) and microtubule polarisation excitations, finding decoherence times of 10⁻¹³ to 10⁻²⁰ seconds for both—far shorter than any neural process.

**Neural side.** Conscious decisions involve empirically established timing windows. Thura and Cisek (2014) found motor commitment signatures at approximately 280 milliseconds. Bengson et al. (2019) measured willed attention deployment at approximately 300 milliseconds. The Libet readiness potential begins approximately 550 milliseconds before action. Any quantum mechanism that influences conscious decisions must remain operative long enough to interact with these neural windows.

The gap is not a matter of degree. Femtoseconds and hundreds of milliseconds differ by a factor of roughly 10¹². No known physical process bridges such a disparity through simple scaling.

## Responses to the Gap

### Revised Decoherence Estimates

Hagan et al. (2002) challenged Tegmark's parameters for microtubule decoherence, arguing he used unrealistic superposition separation distances (24 nanometres versus the smaller distances Orch OR specifies), inappropriate thermal equilibrium assumptions, and incorrect charge models. Their corrected calculations yielded decoherence times of 10⁻⁵ to 10⁻⁴ seconds—seven orders of magnitude longer. Bandyopadhyay's laboratory measurements found collective oscillations in isolated microtubules consistent with coherence lasting approximately 100 microseconds (reported in Hameroff & Penrose, 2014).

This narrows the gap from twelve orders of magnitude to roughly three. Yet 100 microseconds remains far shorter than the 280-300 millisecond decision windows, so revised estimates alone do not resolve the problem.

### Mechanism-Specific Strategies

Different quantum consciousness proposals face the timing gap differently (see [[comparing-quantum-consciousness-mechanisms]] for detailed comparison):

**Orch OR** requires sustained quantum coherence in microtubules until gravitational self-collapse occurs. This makes Orch OR highly vulnerable to the timing gap because the mechanism depends on coherence persisting long enough for objective reduction. Perry (2025) has proposed mesoscopic coherent domains with predicted coherence times of 1-10 milliseconds, which would bring quantum timescales into contact with neural oscillations, but this prediction awaits experimental verification.

**[[stapp-quantum-mind|Stapp's quantum Zeno approach]]** avoids sustained coherence requirements. The quantum Zeno effect operates through discrete, repeated observation events rather than through maintaining a coherent state over time. Each observation is instantaneous; the effect accumulates through rapid repetition. If each observation cycle operates at microsecond timescales, approximately 1,000 observations within a 300-millisecond decision window would suffice. Atkins et al. (2024) demonstrated Zeno-mediated coherence protection in cryptochrome proteins, providing a biological precedent for this mechanism. The Zeno approach also predicts that sustained attention should feel effortful—a phenomenological signature consistent with the repetitive observation the mechanism requires (see [[mental-effort]]).

**Fisher's nuclear spin proposal** sidesteps the gap entirely. Phosphorus-31 nuclear spins in Posner molecules have predicted coherence times of hours to possibly a day (Fisher, 2015), though subsequent analysis by Swift et al. (2018) derived shorter upper bounds. Even at reduced estimates, nuclear spin coherence far exceeds neural timescales. The challenge for this proposal is not timing but demonstrating that nuclear spin coherence can influence neural computation.

### Post-Decoherence Selection

The Map's preferred framework—post-decoherence selection—operates at a different level of analysis where the timing gap does not apply. [[decoherence|Decoherence does not solve the measurement problem]]: after decoherence selects preferred bases and suppresses interference, the system remains in a mixture of possible outcomes. Something must determine which outcome becomes actual. If consciousness acts at this point—at the moment of measurement rather than during coherent evolution—then the duration of coherence is irrelevant.

This response shifts the question from "How long does coherence last?" to "What determines measurement outcomes?" The timing gap constrains theories that require sustained coherence but does not touch theories that operate at the point of collapse itself. This immunity has an epistemological cost: a framework that cannot be falsified by timing evidence has, by that very immunity, reduced empirical content. The Map accepts this trade-off because the question of what determines measurement outcomes is independently motivated by the [[measurement-problem]]—it is not an escape invented to avoid the timing gap.

## Why the Gap Matters

The timing gap problem disciplines quantum consciousness theorising. It prevents vague appeals to "quantum effects in the brain" by demanding specific mechanisms with specific timing requirements. Any proposal must specify: What quantum states are involved? How long must they persist? What neural process do they influence? At what timescale does the interaction occur?

The gap also bears on [[topics/free-will|free will]]. The Map's preferred grounding for [[agent-causation]] runs through quantum indeterminacy—consciousness biasing which outcome becomes actual at moments of genuine choice (see [[quantum-indeterminacy-free-will]]). If the timing gap eliminates quantum consciousness mechanisms, it eliminates this grounding for libertarian free will with them. Conversely, frameworks that survive the gap (post-decoherence selection, the Zeno approach) preserve the quantum opening for genuine agency.

The gap illustrates a general methodological point. The Map takes empirical constraints seriously even when they challenge its own commitments. If quantum consciousness theories cannot address the timing gap, the Map must either identify mechanisms that survive the objection or acknowledge that the quantum interface remains undemonstrated.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The timing gap problem directly challenges the Map's [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet. The Map responds not by dismissing the challenge but by distinguishing between mechanisms that require sustained coherence and those that do not. Post-decoherence selection—where consciousness biases which outcome becomes actual after decoherence has already occurred—is timing-agnostic and thus immune to the gap objection. This is one reason the Map favours framework-level approaches over specific quantum mechanism commitments.

The [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]] tenet is presupposed by the entire discussion. Under many-worlds interpretations, there is no collapse, no outcome selection, and therefore no timing gap problem—but also no role for consciousness in determining which outcome becomes actual. The Map rejects many-worlds partly because it dissolves the very questions about consciousness and measurement that the Map takes to be genuine.

The [[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]] tenet is relevant here: the timing gap is an empirical constraint that demands engagement, not a simplicity argument that can be deflected philosophically. The Map's intellectual honesty requires acknowledging that some quantum consciousness mechanisms (particularly those requiring sustained coherence) face genuine difficulties that revised decoherence estimates have narrowed but not eliminated.
