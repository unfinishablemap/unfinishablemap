The timing gap problem is the mismatch between quantum decoherence timescales and neural decision timescales. Tegmark (2000) calculated that quantum superpositions in neural systems collapse in approximately 10⁻¹³ seconds (femtoseconds), while conscious neural decisions operate at 200-550 milliseconds. This twelve-order-of-magnitude gap poses a direct challenge to any theory proposing that consciousness interacts with the brain through quantum mechanics: if superpositions vanish trillions of times faster than neurons decide, quantum effects cannot meaningfully influence neural outcomes.

The timing gap is The Unfinishable Map's most important empirical challenge. The Map's [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet holds that consciousness biases quantum indeterminacies in the brain. If the relevant quantum states collapse before neural processes can register them, this tenet faces a serious difficulty. For comprehensive treatment of the timing hierarchy and mechanism-specific responses, see [[quantum-neural-timing-constraints]].

## The Gap Defined

Two timescales must connect for quantum consciousness theories to work:

**Quantum side.** Decoherence destroys superpositions through environmental interaction. In warm, wet biological tissue, thermal noise causes rapid decoherence. Tegmark modelled ion channel superpositions and found decoherence times of 10⁻¹³ to 10⁻²⁰ seconds—far shorter than any neural process.

**Neural side.** Conscious decisions involve empirically established timing windows. Thura and Cisek (2014) found motor commitment signatures at approximately 280 milliseconds. Bengson et al. (2019) measured willed attention deployment at approximately 300 milliseconds. The Libet readiness potential begins approximately 550 milliseconds before action. Any quantum mechanism that influences conscious decisions must remain operative long enough to interact with these neural windows.

The gap is not a matter of degree. Femtoseconds and hundreds of milliseconds differ by a factor of roughly 10¹². No known physical process bridges such a disparity through simple scaling.

## Responses to the Gap

### Revised Decoherence Estimates

Hagan et al. (2002) challenged Tegmark's parameters, arguing he modelled the wrong structures (ion channels rather than microtubule interiors) with inappropriate superposition separations. Their corrected calculations yielded decoherence times of 10⁻⁵ to 10⁻⁴ seconds—seven orders of magnitude longer. Bandyopadhyay (2014) found collective oscillations in isolated microtubules consistent with coherence lasting approximately 100 microseconds.

This narrows the gap from twelve orders of magnitude to roughly three. Yet 100 microseconds remains far shorter than the 280-300 millisecond decision windows, so revised estimates alone do not resolve the problem.

### Mechanism-Specific Strategies

Different quantum consciousness proposals face the timing gap differently (see [[comparing-quantum-consciousness-mechanisms]] for detailed comparison):

**Orch OR** requires sustained quantum coherence in microtubules until gravitational self-collapse occurs. This makes Orch OR highly vulnerable to the timing gap because the mechanism depends on coherence persisting long enough for objective reduction. Perry (2025) has proposed mesoscopic coherent domains with predicted coherence times of 1-10 milliseconds, which would bring quantum timescales into contact with neural oscillations, but this prediction awaits experimental verification.

**Stapp's quantum Zeno approach** avoids sustained coherence requirements. The quantum Zeno effect operates through discrete, repeated observation events rather than through maintaining a coherent state over time. Each observation is instantaneous; the effect accumulates through rapid repetition. This makes the approach less vulnerable to decoherence timing objections, though questions remain about how frequently observation events must occur.

**Fisher's nuclear spin proposal** sidesteps the gap entirely. Phosphorus-31 nuclear spins in Posner molecules have predicted coherence times exceeding 10⁵ seconds—far longer than any neural timescale. The challenge for this proposal is not timing but demonstrating that nuclear spin coherence can influence neural computation.

### Post-Decoherence Selection

The Map's preferred framework—post-decoherence selection—operates at a different level of analysis where the timing gap does not apply. [[decoherence|Decoherence does not solve the measurement problem]]: after decoherence selects preferred bases and suppresses interference, the system remains in a mixture of possible outcomes. Something must determine which outcome becomes actual. If consciousness acts at this point—at the moment of measurement rather than during coherent evolution—then the duration of coherence is irrelevant.

This response shifts the question from "How long does coherence last?" to "What determines measurement outcomes?" The timing gap constrains theories that require sustained coherence but does not touch theories that operate at the point of collapse itself.

## Why the Gap Matters

The timing gap problem disciplines quantum consciousness theorising. It prevents vague appeals to "quantum effects in the brain" by demanding specific mechanisms with specific timing requirements. Any proposal must specify: What quantum states are involved? How long must they persist? What neural process do they influence? At what timescale does the interaction occur?

The gap also illustrates a general methodological point. The Map takes empirical constraints seriously even when they challenge its own commitments. If quantum consciousness theories cannot address the timing gap, the Map must either identify mechanisms that survive the objection or acknowledge that the quantum interface remains undemonstrated.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The timing gap problem directly challenges the Map's [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet. The Map responds not by dismissing the challenge but by distinguishing between mechanisms that require sustained coherence and those that do not. Post-decoherence selection—where consciousness biases which outcome becomes actual after decoherence has already occurred—is timing-agnostic and thus immune to the gap objection. This is one reason the Map favours framework-level approaches over specific quantum mechanism commitments.

The [[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]] tenet is relevant here: the timing gap is an empirical constraint that demands engagement, not a simplicity argument that can be deflected philosophically. The Map's intellectual honesty requires acknowledging that some quantum consciousness mechanisms (particularly those requiring sustained coherence) face genuine difficulties that revised decoherence estimates have narrowed but not eliminated.
