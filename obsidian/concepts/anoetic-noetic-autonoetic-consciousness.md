Endel Tulving's tripartite framework divides consciousness into three levels defined by increasing self-awareness: *anoetic* (non-knowing), *noetic* (knowing), and *autonoetic* (self-knowing). Each level accompanies a distinct memory system and introduces qualitative features absent from the level below. The framework matters for The Unfinishable Map because the transitions between levels—particularly the emergence of autonoetic self-awareness—resist explanation in purely computational terms. A system that retrieves information need not *re-experience* anything. The jump from data access to felt temporal self-projection marks a boundary that functionalist accounts struggle to cross.

## The Three Levels

### Anoetic Consciousness

*Anoetic* (Greek: *a-* "without" + *noein* "to know") consciousness accompanies procedural and [[implicit-memory|implicit memory]]. A person riding a bicycle, touch-typing, or catching a ball operates with skilled awareness that involves no self-reference. There is experience—something it is like to balance, to feel keys under fingers—but no representation of oneself *as* the experiencer. Tulving emphasised that anoetic consciousness is not *absent* consciousness but a distinct mode: what he called "non-reflective [[qualia]]." The skilled pianist feels the music flowing through their fingers; the experienced driver senses the road. These are genuine phenomenal states, temporally bound to the present moment, with no sense of past learning or projection into future performance.

Animals with procedural learning but no episodic memory likely operate at this level (Tulving, 1985). The [[baseline-cognition|baseline cognition hypothesis]] suggests great apes possess sophisticated anoetic and noetic processing without reaching the autonoetic capacities that distinguish human cognition.

### Noetic Consciousness

*Noetic* (Greek: *noein* "to know") consciousness accompanies [[semantic-memory|semantic memory]]—factual knowledge detached from the circumstances of its acquisition. Knowing that Paris is in France, that water boils at 100°C, or that Tulving studied memory involves awareness of the knowledge *as* knowledge. The knower recognises they possess the information, but does not re-experience when or where they learned it.

Noetic consciousness introduces a reflexive dimension absent from anoetic awareness. The tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon reveals its phenomenal texture: the frustrating sense of *almost* knowing, the feeling of imminent retrieval, the recognition when the word arrives that it was the right one. These are qualitative states—[[cognitive-phenomenology|cognitive phenomenology]]—not merely information-processing outcomes. See the dedicated article on [[semantic-memory|semantic memory and noetic consciousness]] for extended treatment.

### Autonoetic Consciousness

*Autonoetic* (Greek: *autos* "self" + *noein* "to know") consciousness accompanies [[episodic-memory|episodic memory]] and enables mental time travel. When remembering a past event, the autonoetic subject is simultaneously present as the rememberer *here now* and as the protagonist *there then*. This double presence of self, the felt sense of pastness, and the qualitative character of re-living distinguish autonoetic from noetic awareness.

Wheeler, Stuss, and Tulving (1997) defined autonoetic consciousness as "the capacity that allows adult humans to mentally represent and to become aware of their protracted existence across time." The same capacity enables future-directed simulation: imagining a forthcoming conversation involves first-person projection, not abstract representation. The *remember/know* paradigm operationalises this distinction experimentally: subjects who "remember" an item re-experience its encoding context (autonoetic), while those who "know" it recognise it without re-experiencing (noetic)—same information, different [[phenomenal-consciousness|phenomenal]] accompaniment. See [[episodic-memory]] for the full treatment, including clinical evidence, the remember/know paradigm, and implications for [[personal-identity]].

## The Hierarchy as Evidence

The framework is more than a taxonomy. The fact that consciousness comes in graded levels, each introducing qualitatively new features, constrains theories of what consciousness is.

### Qualitative Discontinuities

The transitions between levels are not merely increases in processing complexity. Anoetic-to-noetic involves the emergence of reflexive self-reference: the system begins to represent *that it knows*. Noetic-to-autonoetic involves the emergence of temporal self-projection: the system begins to represent *itself as existing across time*. Each transition adds [[phenomenal-consciousness|phenomenal]] features—the feeling of knowing, the pastness quale—that the lower level lacks entirely. This is the [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|hard problem]] in miniature: why should increased representational complexity produce qualitatively new experience rather than just more sophisticated data handling?

A purely quantitative account would predict smooth variation: more processing power, richer representations, but no qualitative breaks. Physical phase transitions (water to ice) produce apparent discontinuities from quantitative changes—but those transitions are fully derivable from molecular properties. The consciousness transitions are not derivable from computational properties. Tulving's framework suggests something more radical. The jump from noetic to autonoetic does not look like more of the same. It looks like a different kind of awareness altogether—an [[explanatory-gap]] that functional description alone cannot bridge.

### Clinical Dissociations

Neuropsychological cases confirm that the levels are genuinely separable rather than points on a continuum:

- **Patient KC** (extensive bilateral brain damage from a motorcycle accident, including severe hippocampal lesions): Retained semantic memory and noetic awareness while losing episodic memory and autonoetic consciousness entirely. He could state facts about his life but could not re-experience any of them. Asked about tomorrow, his mind was "blank" (Tulving, 2002).
- **Semantic dementia** patients show the inverse pattern: progressive loss of noetic access to factual knowledge while episodic memory remains relatively intact in early stages.
- **Basal ganglia disorders** (Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease) can impair procedural learning and anoetic skill execution while leaving both noetic and autonoetic systems relatively intact—confirming that the anoetic level depends on distinct neural substrates.

These dissociations show that each level depends on distinct neural substrates and can be selectively damaged. Consciousness is not a single capacity that scales up—it is a structured hierarchy with separable components.

### The Semanticisation Problem

Episodic memories gradually lose their autonoetic character over time, retaining content while shedding the phenomenal quality of re-experiencing. You may know you went to a particular school without being able to re-inhabit any specific day there. The information migrates from episodic to semantic storage—from autonoetic to noetic consciousness.

This process reveals something important: the *same propositional content* can be accompanied by qualitatively different forms of awareness. A physicalist might respond that information *is* lost during semanticisation—contextual details, sensory textures, temporal markers all decay. But this concedes the point rather than defeating it. Even when the propositional core is identical ("I attended that school"), the phenomenal difference between autonoetic re-experiencing and noetic factual knowledge persists. The remember/know paradigm confirms this experimentally: subjects can encounter the same item and either "remember" it (with autonoetic re-experiencing) or "know" it (with noetic recognition), demonstrating that phenomenal character varies independently of informational content. [[consciousness|Consciousness]] adds something beyond the data.

## Comparative Dimensions

Tulving's hierarchy maps suggestively onto other classifications of mind:

| Tulving Level | Memory System | Self-Awareness | Temporal Scope | Comparative |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| Anoetic | Procedural | Pre-reflective | Present | Most animals |
| Noetic | Semantic | Reflexive | Atemporal | Higher mammals? |
| Autonoetic | Episodic | Temporal self | Past and future | Humans (primarily) |

The comparative column is approximate. Whether any non-human animals achieve genuine autonoetic consciousness remains debated. Scrub-jays cache food in ways suggesting future planning (Clayton & Dickinson, 1998); great apes may form episodic-like memories. But the full autonoetic capacity—representing oneself as extending across subjective time—appears most clearly in humans. The difficulty of settling this question from the outside illustrates a deeper point: third-person observation cannot determine whether an animal's behaviour involves felt temporal self-projection or merely sophisticated future-oriented processing.

## Relation to Site Perspective

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]**: The qualitative discontinuities between levels resist reductive explanation. A computational system that retrieves information need not *feel* that it knows (noetic) or *re-experience* past events (autonoetic). The transitions introduce irreducible phenomenal properties—felt knowing, felt pastness, temporal self-presence—that physical descriptions of neural activity do not entail.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]**: Autonoetic consciousness is not passive recording. Choosing to dwell on a memory, to mentally rehearse a future scenario, or to deliberately recall an event all influence subsequent neural states. The hierarchy shows consciousness becoming increasingly *active* at higher levels—from anoetic receptivity through noetic recognition to autonoetic temporal projection—consistent with increasing causal efficacy.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]**: Autonoetic consciousness presupposes a determinate personal history. Mental time travel to *this* past and *this* projected future requires that the rememberer has a single narrative identity extending across time. Many-worlds fragmentation—where every quantum event spawns branching versions of the subject—undermines the indexical "I" that autonoetic experience requires. The felt pastness of episodic memory is pastness of *my* past, not of one among infinitely many pasts.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]**: The "simpler" explanation—that all three levels are just different complexities of information processing—fails to account for the qualitative character each introduces. Semanticisation demonstrates that identical propositional content can shift between consciousness levels. Parsimony that ignores this phenomenal data purchases simplicity at the cost of explanatory adequacy.

## What Would Challenge This View?

The dualist interpretation of Tulving's hierarchy would be weakened by several possible findings:

- **A computational system that genuinely re-experiences.** If an artificial system could demonstrate autonoetic re-experiencing (not merely report it), the claim that the transition from data access to felt re-experiencing requires non-physical properties would lose force. The difficulty is verifying phenomenal states from the outside—the same problem that afflicts comparative animal cognition.
- **Smooth neural gradients rather than discontinuities.** If improved neuroimaging revealed continuous variation between anoetic, noetic, and autonoetic processing rather than separable substrates, the qualitative discontinuity argument would weaken. Current dissociation evidence (Patient KC, semantic dementia) favours separability, but future evidence could complicate this picture.
- **A functionalist account of semanticisation.** If the phenomenal shift from autonoetic to noetic could be fully explained by changes in information structure—not just correlated with them—the argument from semanticisation would lose its force.
