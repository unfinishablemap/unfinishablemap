The Unfinishable Map holds that consciousness is not reducible to physical processes. If this is correct, several core doctrines in philosophy of science — the unity of science, standard demarcation criteria, theory choice by parsimony, and scientific realism about unobservables — require revision. Not abandonment. Revision. Dualism does not reject science. It redraws the boundaries of what science studies, how it chooses between theories, and what scientific success actually tells us about reality.

Other articles on the Map address how dualism affects [[consciousness-and-scientific-explanation|scientific explanation]] and [[consciousness-and-scientific-methodology|methodology]]. This article addresses the structural questions one level up: how philosophy of science itself changes when a fundamental domain — conscious experience — falls outside the physical.

## The Unity of Science

Logical positivists championed the unity of science: all genuine sciences ultimately reduce to physics. Chemistry reduces to quantum mechanics, biology to chemistry, psychology to neuroscience, neuroscience to physics. This reductive chain promises a single explanatory framework for everything real.

Dualism breaks this chain at a specific link. If consciousness is irreducible, then psychology does not fully reduce to neuroscience, because the phenomenal dimension of mental life is not a neural property. The neural correlates of consciousness are real and investigable, but the experience they correlate with belongs to a different ontological category.

This does not mean psychology becomes unscientific. It means psychology studies a domain that straddles two categories — the physical processes of the brain and the phenomenal properties of experience — connected by lawful regularities that are not reductive identities. The Map's framework of [[psychophysical-laws-bridging-mind-and-matter|psychophysical laws]] provides the positive alternative: bridge laws connecting domains rather than collapsing one into the other.

The unity of science survives in a modified form. All physical sciences still reduce to physics. What changes is that physics is not the only fundamental domain. Science becomes unified within domains and lawfully connected across them.

## Demarcation Revisited

The demarcation problem asks: what distinguishes science from non-science? Dualism is routinely dismissed as unscientific, but this dismissal relies on demarcation criteria that are either too narrow or self-undermining.

**Falsifiability.** Popper's criterion requires that scientific claims be falsifiable. Dualist claims about consciousness meet this standard in at least two ways. First, if neuroscience demonstrated that a complete physical description of the brain logically entailed all facts about consciousness — if the [[explanatory-gap]] closed — dualism would be falsified. Second, the Map's [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet makes a specific empirical claim: consciousness biases otherwise indeterminate quantum outcomes in neural systems. This is falsifiable in principle, as sufficiently sensitive measurements could detect or fail to detect the predicted bias.

The stronger objection is that dualism is not falsifiable *in practice* at current measurement precision. But this objection also applies to string theory, certain multiverse hypotheses, and other proposals that philosophy of science does not typically dismiss as unscientific. Practical unfalsifiability at a given technological stage does not equal unfalsifiability in principle.

**Methodological naturalism.** A common criterion holds that science restricts itself to natural (physical) explanations. Under this criterion, dualism is unscientific by definition — not because it fails empirically, but because it posits something non-physical. This is circular when applied to the question of whether consciousness is physical. Using "only physical explanations count as scientific" to argue against dualism presupposes the conclusion.

The Map's position: demarcation should be functional rather than ontological. What makes an inquiry scientific is systematic investigation, lawful regularity, empirical constraint, and intersubjective testability — not a prior commitment to the ontological nature of the domain.

## Theory Choice and Parsimony

When scientists choose between rival theories, they invoke theoretical virtues: empirical adequacy, parsimony, scope, fruitfulness, consistency with established science. Parsimony — Occam's Razor — typically favours physicalism over dualism. Why posit two fundamental categories when one might suffice?

The Map's [[tenets#^occams-limits|fifth tenet]] challenges this reasoning directly. Parsimony assumes we understand enough to judge what is genuinely simple. In the history of science, the "simpler" theory has repeatedly been wrong: geocentrism over heliocentrism, continuous matter over atoms, classical determinism over quantum indeterminacy. Each time, nature turned out to be more complex than the simplest available theory predicted.

More precisely, parsimony as a theory-choice criterion is domain-relative. Within physics, preferring fewer fundamental forces is well-motivated because the track record of unification is strong. But the question of whether consciousness reduces to physics is not a question *within* physics. It is a question about whether physics exhausts what is real. Applying parsimony across this boundary assumes the very thing in dispute.

Kuhn's insight is relevant here. Theory choice is not algorithmic. Scientists weigh virtues differently depending on disciplinary norms and background assumptions. Materialist philosophy of mind weights parsimony heavily because it treats the physical as a settled baseline. Dualist philosophy of mind weights explanatory adequacy — the capacity to account for phenomenal experience — more heavily because it treats consciousness as the most certain datum we have.

Neither weighting is irrational. They reflect different judgments about what we know most securely and where the burden of explanation falls.

## Scientific Realism and the Consciousness Problem

Scientific realism holds that successful scientific theories describe reality approximately correctly, including their claims about unobservable entities. Electrons, quarks, and genes are real because the theories that posit them are empirically successful.

Under dualism, scientific realism requires extension rather than rejection. The physical sciences remain realistic about their posits — the success of physics, chemistry, and neuroscience gives us good reason to believe their theoretical entities exist. What changes is that reality includes more than what physical theories describe. Phenomenal properties are real, directly known through first-person experience, and not captured by any physical theory however successful.

This generates an asymmetry in epistemology. We know about electrons through inference to the best explanation from experimental data. We know about conscious experience through direct acquaintance. The realist case for phenomenal properties is actually *stronger* than the realist case for electrons — we have immediate epistemic access to experience in a way we never have to subatomic particles. Dismissing consciousness as unreal or reducible while accepting electrons as real inverts the epistemic order.

The anti-realist might respond that phenomenal experience, unlike electrons, does no explanatory work in physical theories. But the Map's [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet denies this: consciousness causally contributes to physical outcomes. If so, a complete science would need to include consciousness not merely as an explanandum but as an explanans — something that features in explanations, not just something to be explained.

## Research Programmes and Paradigm Structure

Lakatos distinguished progressive research programmes (generating novel predictions confirmed by evidence) from degenerating ones (protecting a core thesis through *ad hoc* adjustments). Where does the materialist programme stand?

The materialist research programme in consciousness science has a well-defined core: consciousness is identical to or supervenes on physical processes. Its protective belt includes identity theory, functionalism, higher-order theories, global workspace theory, and integrated information theory. Each aims to explain consciousness physically.

The programme has been empirically progressive in identifying neural correlates. fMRI, EEG, and lesion studies reveal increasingly fine-grained connections between brain states and conscious states. But it has been explanatorily stagnant on the hard problem. Decades of work have not narrowed the [[explanatory-gap]] between physical description and phenomenal experience. Each new theory restates the puzzle in different terms without closing it.

A Lakatosian assessment might classify the materialist consciousness programme as empirically progressive but theoretically degenerating: accumulating correlational data while failing to make progress on its central explanatory claim. The dualist alternative is not itself a mature research programme in Lakatos's sense — it has fewer specific predictions and less institutional support. But it may be the more honest framework: it acknowledges the explanatory gap as reflecting genuine ontological structure rather than treating it as a temporary embarrassment.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The Unfinishable Map interprets philosophy of science under dualism as revealing limitations in frameworks originally designed for an entirely physical world.

The [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]] tenet means the unity of science cannot hold in its strong reductive form. If consciousness is irreducible, one link in the reductive chain is permanently missing. Science becomes a federation of domains — physical sciences connected by reduction, psychophysical sciences connected by bridge laws — rather than a single reductive hierarchy.

The [[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]] tenet bears directly on theory choice. The preference for physicalism over dualism on grounds of parsimony assumes that fewer ontological categories is genuinely simpler. But if consciousness is real and irreducible, the "simpler" physicalist theory achieves its simplicity by ignoring what it cannot explain. Parsimony that requires denying the most certain datum we have — our own experience — is not genuine parsimony.

The [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet provides something most philosophical dualisms lack: a falsifiable empirical claim that connects the framework to ongoing scientific investigation. This directly addresses the demarcation worry by anchoring dualism in testable predictions rather than pure metaphysics.
