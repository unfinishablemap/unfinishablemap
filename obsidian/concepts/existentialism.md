Existentialism is a philosophical tradition centred on individual existence, freedom, and the challenge of creating meaning in a universe that provides none ready-made.

The core insight is deceptively simple: existence precedes essence. Unlike a hammer, which is designed for a purpose before it exists, human beings exist first and only then define themselves through their choices. There is no pre-given human nature, no cosmic script, no essence waiting to be discovered. We are, as Jean-Paul Sartre put it, "condemned to be free."

## Origins and Key Thinkers

Existentialism emerged from 19th-century philosophy, particularly the work of Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche. Kierkegaard emphasized subjective experience, the "leap of faith," and the anxiety that accompanies genuine choice. Nietzsche proclaimed the death of God and challenged humanity to create new values in the absence of divine authority.

The tradition flowered in 20th-century France with Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and Albert Camus. German philosophers Martin Heidegger and Karl Jaspers developed related ideas, though Heidegger resisted the "existentialist" label.

Key works include:
- Kierkegaard's *Either/Or* and *Fear and Trembling*
- Nietzsche's *Thus Spoke Zarathustra* and *Beyond Good and Evil*
- Heidegger's *Being and Time*
- Sartre's *Being and Nothingness* and *Existentialism Is a Humanism*
- Camus' *The Myth of Sisyphus* and *The Stranger*
- de Beauvoir's *The Second Sex* and *The Ethics of Ambiguity*

## Core Themes

### Existence Precedes Essence

For existentialists, humans are not born with a fixed nature or purpose. We exist first—thrown into the world without our consent—and only subsequently create ourselves through our choices and actions. This reverses the traditional view that essence (what something is) precedes existence (that it is).

A paper cutter is designed for cutting paper; its essence precedes its existence. But what is a human being *for*? Existentialism answers: nothing in particular. We must decide for ourselves.

### Radical Freedom

If there is no essence determining what we must be, then we are radically free. Every moment presents a choice. Even refusing to choose is itself a choice. This freedom is not liberating in any comfortable sense—it is the source of profound anxiety.

Sartre called this anxiety *angoisse*. We experience it when we recognize that nothing constrains our choices except ourselves. There are no guardrails, no excuses, no appeals to human nature or divine will. The weight of responsibility falls entirely on us.

### Authenticity

Given radical freedom, the question becomes how to live. Existentialists distinguish between authentic and inauthentic existence.

Inauthentic living means fleeing from freedom—following social conventions unreflectively, defining oneself by external roles, pretending that choices are determined by circumstances. Heidegger called this falling into "das Man" (the They)—living as "one" does rather than as *I* choose.

Authentic existence means owning one's freedom, making choices with full awareness that they are one's own, and accepting responsibility for what one becomes. It means facing anxiety rather than fleeing it.

### Absurdity

Camus emphasized the *absurd*—the confrontation between the human desire for meaning and the universe's indifferent silence. We want reasons, purposes, a cosmic story in which we matter. The universe offers none.

The absurd is not a property of the world or of human beings alone, but of the relation between them—our demand for meaning meeting the world's refusal to supply it.

Camus asked: given the absurd, why not suicide? His answer: we must imagine Sisyphus happy. The appropriate response to absurdity is not despair but revolt—continuing to live and create meaning despite the universe's silence.

### Bad Faith

Sartre's concept of *mauvaise foi* (bad faith) describes the ways we deceive ourselves about our freedom. We pretend our choices are determined—by our past, our circumstances, our nature, our social role. We flee responsibility by treating ourselves as things rather than as free beings.

A waiter who plays at being a waiter too perfectly, as if his role determined his every gesture, is in bad faith. He pretends to be a waiter in the way an inkwell is an inkwell—as if he had no choice in the matter.

Bad faith is not simple lying (which requires knowing the truth). It is a peculiar self-deception in which we are both deceiver and deceived, simultaneously knowing and not knowing our freedom.

## Existentialism and Meaning

Existentialism is often misread as nihilistic—as claiming that nothing matters and life is pointless. This misses the point.

Existentialists agree that the universe provides no ready-made meaning. But they do not conclude that meaning is impossible. Instead, they insist that meaning must be *created* rather than *discovered*. The absence of cosmic purpose is not the end of meaning but the beginning of human meaning-making.

Sartre: "Man is nothing else but what he makes of himself."

Camus: "The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart."

The challenge is to create meaning without pretending it was there all along—to own one's values as choices rather than discoveries.

## The Illusionist Challenge

[[illusionism|Illusionists]] like Daniel Dennett and Keith Frankish pose a fundamental challenge to existentialism. If phenomenal consciousness is an introspective illusion—if there's nothing it's *like* to choose, to feel anguish, to confront the absurd—then the entire existentialist edifice rests on a misrepresentation. The "lived experience" that existentialism takes as its starting point would be a brain's self-modelling error.

### The Regress Response

Illusionism faces its characteristic regress problem when applied to existentialist themes. For the anguish of freedom to be an illusion, something must experience that illusory anguish. The *seeming* of radical choice must *seem to* something—and that something cannot be another representation without infinite regress. As Raymond Tallis argues, "misrepresentation presupposes presentation."

Sartre's phenomenology actually anticipates this response. The pour-soi (being-for-itself) is precisely the structure of awareness that cannot be reduced to thinghood. Bad faith involves fleeing from this awareness—but the very possibility of flight presupposes the awareness being fled. The illusionist's reduction of consciousness to functional self-modelling is itself a sophisticated form of bad faith: treating consciousness as an en-soi (a thing among things) rather than the pour-soi it reveals itself to be.

### Contemplative Evidence

Extended [[introspection]] and [[meditation-and-consciousness-modes|contemplative practice]] bear on this dispute. If illusionism were correct, sustained attention to experience should eventually reveal the "illusion" of phenomenal consciousness—dissolve it the way understanding dissolves optical illusions. Instead, contemplative traditions report that practice *refines* phenomenal access. The existentialist's authentic confrontation with freedom deepens rather than dissolves through introspection.

[[witness-consciousness|Witness consciousness]] provides a particularly relevant case. The capacity to observe thoughts as objects—without identifying with them—demonstrates the subject-object structure existentialism takes seriously. This structure resists illusionist reduction: something witnesses, and that witnessing cannot itself become the witnessed without infinite regress. The existentialist's authentic self-awareness is a specific mode of this witnessing capacity.

### The Haecceity Connection

Existentialism's emphasis on self-creation gains depth when connected to [[haecceity]]—the quality of being *this* particular thing rather than a qualitative duplicate. When Sartre insists that you create yourself through your choices, the self created is not a pattern that could be replicated but *this* unrepeatable subject. A perfect functional replica would share your psychological patterns but lack your haecceity—your indexical thisness.

This connection strengthens the anti-illusionist position. Illusionism treats consciousness as a certain kind of information processing—something multiply realisable and in principle duplicable. But existentialist self-creation, if genuine, creates something non-replicable: *this* conscious perspective with *this* history of authentic choices. The [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]] tenet preserves what existentialism requires: choices that matter because they are made by *this* subject, not by one of infinitely many branch-duplicates.

## Process Philosophy Perspective

Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy illuminates existentialist themes from a complementary angle. For Whitehead, reality consists of "actual occasions"—momentary experiential events that arise, incorporate their past, and perish. Experience is not something that emerges mysteriously from non-experiential matter; it pervades reality at every level.

### Becoming Over Being

Existentialism's insight that "existence precedes essence" resonates with Whitehead's prioritisation of *becoming* over *being*. For both frameworks, what something is cannot be separated from how it comes to be. Sartre's claim that humans create themselves through choices echoes Whitehead's notion that each actual occasion achieves its own "concrescence"—its process of self-constitution.

The key difference: Whitehead extends this principle to all of reality, not just human existence. Every actual occasion has a "subjective aim"—a way of taking up its given past and actualising one possibility among many. What existentialists describe as uniquely human (self-creation through choice) may be the self-aware form of something more fundamental.

### Process Haecceity

Process philosophy suggests haecceity operates moment-to-moment. Each actual occasion is *this* particular event, unrepeatable and non-substitutable. The existentialist self, rather than being a permanent entity that creates itself over time, might be a series of actual occasions each achieving its own haecceitistic particularity.

This reframes the Buddhist-existentialist dialogue. The Buddhist denial of a permanent self and the existentialist insistence on self-creation become compatible: there is genuine self-creation at each moment without a substantial self persisting across moments. The candle flame analogy from the article's "Compatibility Thesis" section fits naturally here—each moment of authentic choice is genuinely creative while impermanent.

### Concrescence and Authentic Choice

Whitehead's "concrescence" describes how an actual occasion unifies its inheritance from the past with its subjective aim into a determinate actuality. This provides a metaphysical framework for what existentialists describe phenomenologically: the moment of authentic choice where possibilities collapse into a single actuality.

The [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet gains theoretical support here. If consciousness participates in concrescence—contributing subjective aim to what would otherwise be merely inherited pattern—then consciousness genuinely makes a difference to physical outcomes. Existentialist freedom becomes not merely a phenomenological description but a metaphysical reality.

## Contemplative Evidence

The existentialist tradition has not systematically engaged with contemplative practice, but connections are illuminating.

### Witness Consciousness and Authenticity

[[witness-consciousness|Witness consciousness]]—the capacity to observe mental contents without identification—relates paradoxically to existentialist authenticity. On one reading, witnessing is the opposite of authentic engagement: detached observation rather than committed choice. But a deeper reading suggests witnessing is the *ground* of authentic choice.

To choose authentically requires first seeing one's situation clearly—including one's tendencies toward bad faith. The contemplative cultivation of witness awareness provides this clarity. Bad faith involves being *caught* by thoughts and roles, taking them as determining rather than chosen. Witnessing breaks this captivity, revealing thoughts and roles as objects rather than identities. Only then does genuine choice become possible.

### The Phenomenology of Authentic Choice

[[introspection|Introspective]] attention to the moment of choice reveals distinctive phenomenology. There is an experience of options arrayed, of one's own attention moving among them, of something like *gathering* toward decision, and finally the actuality of one having been chosen. This phenomenology resists reductive description—it is not merely the brain's self-modelling but the lived texture of concrescence.

Contemplative practitioners often report increased clarity about this phenomenology through sustained practice. The moment of choice becomes more vivid, not less—supporting the view that practice refines phenomenal access rather than dissolving illusion.

### Mental Effort and Freedom

[[mental-effort|Mental effort]]—the phenomenology of trying—connects to existentialist freedom. The experience of sustaining attention against distraction, of holding to a difficult commitment, of resisting the easier path—this is freedom made palpable. The very effort required suggests something genuinely at stake, something that could go otherwise.

If choices were predetermined, the experience of effort would be systematically illusory—we would *feel* like we're trying while merely executing a determined sequence. But the contemplative report is that effortful attention has genuine effects: sustained practice produces results that unsustained attention doesn't. The phenomenology and the outcomes align.

## What Would Challenge This View?

The existentialist-dualist synthesis developed here would face serious difficulty if:

1. **Illusionism proved explanatorily complete.** If neuroscience could explain not just why we *report* experiences of choice and anguish but why we *have* those experiences—if the illusion problem proved as tractable as illusionists hope—the existentialist's starting point would be undermined. Currently, illusionism faces the regress problem: explaining seeming without invoking what seems.

2. **Contemplative practice dissolved rather than refined the sense of freedom.** If extended practice systematically revealed authentic choice as constructed—if the phenomenology of decision dissolved the way optical illusions dissolve under analysis—existentialism's phenomenological basis would weaken. Currently, contemplative traditions report the opposite.

3. **Quantum decoherence fully ruled out consciousness-brain quantum interaction.** The Map proposes that consciousness influences brain dynamics through quantum mechanisms. If [[decoherence]] proved absolutely fatal to such mechanisms in warm biological tissue—if there were no possible timescales or mechanisms for quantum-consciousness coupling—then the metaphysical grounding for existentialist freedom would be challenged. Currently, the decoherence objection is serious but not decisive: revised timescale estimates, biological quantum effects, and the measurement problem itself leave room for interaction.

4. **Many-worlds proved inescapable.** If the [[many-worlds|many-worlds interpretation]] became consensus physics with no viable alternatives, the existentialist emphasis on singular choice would face profound difficulty. Every choice would actualise all options across branches; the anguish of decision would be misguided since all possibilities are realised. Currently, MWI faces its own problems (the probability problem, preferred basis problem, indexical identity problem), leaving room for single-world interpretations.

5. **Buddhism's no-self proved incompatible with any self-creation.** If deeper engagement with Buddhist philosophy revealed that *anattā* truly rules out the "self" that existentialism claims to create—if the compatibility thesis collapsed—the synthesis would fracture. Currently, the distinction between permanent-self-denial and process-self-affirmation maintains compatibility.

## Relation to The Unfinishable Map's Perspective

Existentialism's emphasis on meaning-creation might seem to conflict with the Map's commitment to dualism and objective reality. If consciousness is real and irreducible, as the [[tenets|Dualism tenet]] holds, doesn't that suggest meaning might be more than mere human projection?

The relationship is complex. Several points of contact:

### Dualism

Existentialism, particularly in Sartre, takes consciousness seriously as fundamentally different from things. The pour-soi (being-for-itself, consciousness) is radically distinct from the en-soi (being-in-itself, things). This phenomenological distinction resonates with dualist commitments to the irreducibility of mind.

Sartre himself did not endorse substance dualism—his ontology remained broadly materialist. But his insistence that consciousness cannot be reduced to thinghood aligns with the [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism tenet]]'s core claim. The pour-soi is characterised by "nothingness"—it is always beyond any characterisation, never identical with its contents. This resistance to objectification is precisely what the Map's dualism articulates metaphysically: consciousness is not another object in the physical inventory.

The illusionist challenge to existentialism (addressed above) ultimately reduces to the question of whether this pour-soi structure is real or merely how the brain models itself. The Map's dualism answers: the structure is real, and the phenomenology of consciousness-as-different-from-things tracks a genuine metaphysical distinction.

### Bidirectional Interaction

If consciousness causally influences the physical world, as the [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction tenet]] proposes, then existentialist claims about human freedom gain metaphysical grounding. We are not merely determined by physical processes—consciousness has genuine causal efficacy.

Existentialism assumes this efficacy but never explains it. Sartre's account of freedom describes the phenomenology of choice without addressing how choice could make a difference in a physically closed world. The Map's framework provides the missing mechanism: consciousness influences outcomes through quantum selection, biasing which neural patterns actualise from among the superpositions the brain maintains. This isn't dualist magic—it's the minimal intervention required for consciousness to matter.

The phenomenology of [[mental-effort]]—the feeling of trying, of sustaining attention against distraction—gains significance here. Effort would be systematically illusory if choices were predetermined. But the contemplative evidence suggests effort has real effects: sustained practice produces outcomes unsustained attention doesn't. Bidirectional interaction explains why this is so.

### Minimal Quantum Interaction

The [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet proposes that consciousness's influence on physics is the smallest possible non-physical intervention—biasing quantum outcomes that physics leaves genuinely indeterminate. This connects to existentialism through the phenomenology of authentic choice.

Authentic existence, in Sartre's account, is not about making grand choices but about owning even mundane decisions. The anguish of freedom arises from recognising that nothing else makes the choice for you. This phenomenology fits a minimal-intervention model: consciousness doesn't rewrite physical law but selects among options that physics permits. The brain generates possibilities; consciousness actualises one. The burden Sartre describes—the impossibility of escaping choice—reflects this structure: even "not choosing" is a quantum selection.

The [[decoherence]] objection (that warm brains cannot maintain quantum coherence) applies here. The Map's response: decoherence challenges are serious but not fatal. Revised timescale estimates, evidence for biological quantum effects, and the unresolved measurement problem leave room for minimal consciousness-quantum coupling. Existentialist freedom doesn't require large-scale quantum coherence—only that consciousness can influence outcomes at the selection moment, however brief.

### No Many Worlds

The [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds tenet]] has particular relevance for existentialism. If Many-Worlds were true, every possible choice occurs in some branch—the self that chose authentically coexists with the self that fled into bad faith. The existentialist emphasis on the weight of choice, on decisions that cannot be undone, presupposes that choices genuinely select one outcome from among possibilities rather than actualising all possibilities simultaneously.

The [[haecceity]] connection deepens this point. Existentialist self-creation creates *this* subject, not a pattern. But many-worlds fragments identity: before choice, there is one you; after, multiple equally real continuations. The anguish of freedom—recognising that *you* must choose—becomes incoherent if "you" will end up making all choices across branches. The phenomenology of singular decision ("I chose this, not that") would be systematically misleading.

The Map's rejection of MWI preserves what existentialism requires: choices that matter because they are truly singular, made by this unrepeatable subject who will bear their consequences alone.

### Occam's Razor Has Limits

Existentialists resist reducing human existence to scientific description. This aligns with the [[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits tenet]]—the view that simple physicalist explanations may miss what matters most about consciousness and meaning.

Parsimonious theories might eliminate the pour-soi as an ontological category, treating it as folk psychology's confused self-description. But parsimony has limits when the phenomenon to be explained is consciousness itself. The simplest account (there's nothing it's like to exist) contradicts the most immediate datum (there's obviously something it's like). Existentialism's commitment to phenomenology—starting from what experience reveals rather than from theoretical preferences—exemplifies the tenet's spirit.

### Tensions and Synthesis

Tensions remain. Existentialism historically emerged from atheist and agnostic commitments. Sartre's ontology, despite describing consciousness as pour-soi, remained broadly materialist in its overall metaphysics—he did not believe in a separate mental substance. The Map's dualism is stronger than anything Sartre would have endorsed. Additionally, existentialism's emphasis on meaning-*creation* may sit uneasily with views that hold certain things objectively matter.

Perhaps the synthesis is this: even if consciousness is real and irreducible, and even if it genuinely matters in the universe, we still face choices about what to do with our existence. The facts of consciousness don't determine our values. Existentialism's insights about freedom, authenticity, and responsibility remain relevant—perhaps more so—within a dualist framework that takes conscious choice seriously as causally efficacious.

The Map's tenets take positions (dualism, bidirectional interaction) that existentialists might see as attempts to ground meaning externally. But grounding the *possibility* of genuine choice is not the same as determining *what* to choose. Existentialist freedom operates within the space the Map's metaphysics opens up.

## Comparison with Eastern Philosophy

Existentialism and [[eastern-philosophy-consciousness|Buddhist philosophy]] both reject the idea of a fixed, discoverable self, but their conclusions diverge sharply.

**The no-self challenge**: Buddhism's doctrine of *anattā* (no-self) holds that there is no enduring self to be found—what we call "I" is a constantly changing process of five aggregates (form, feeling, perception, mental formations, consciousness). The existentialist would agree that there is no pre-given essence, but would insist that the self is *created* through authentic choice.

From a Buddhist perspective, this existentialist response may itself be a form of clinging—the attempt to construct a substantial self through will and decision. The Buddhist path involves releasing attachment to self-construction, not perfecting it.

**Different responses to groundlessness**: Both traditions confront the absence of cosmic meaning. Existentialism responds with heroic self-assertion: since there is no script, we must write our own. Buddhism responds with equanimity: since there is no fixed self to be threatened by meaninglessness, the problem dissolves. The existentialist fears bad faith; the Buddhist fears grasping.

**Convergence on engagement**: Despite these differences, both traditions emphasize *engagement* over escapism. Sartre condemned bad faith; Buddhism condemns spiritual bypassing. Both insist that authentic living requires confronting reality rather than fleeing into comfortable illusions.

### The Compatibility Thesis: A Middle Path

The [[buddhism-and-dualism|compatibility thesis]] offers existentialism a resource it may not have recognized. Buddhism's no-self doctrine targets three specific claims: *permanence* (nothing unchanging underlies experience), *substantiality* (no soul-stuff distinct from the aggregates), and *ownership-centricity* (the sense of "my" experiences is constructed). Crucially, Buddhism accepts that consciousness exists and that experience is real—it denies the permanent owner, not the experience itself.

This suggests a middle path for existentialist self-creation. The existentialist project of making oneself through authentic choice need not aim at constructing a permanent edifice. Instead, authenticity can operate moment-to-moment—each choice genuinely creative, genuinely self-constituting, without accumulating into a substantial self that must be defended. The candle flame analogy: tonight's flame is not yesterday's flame, yet each moment of flame is genuinely fire. Similarly, each moment of authentic choice is genuinely self-creation without requiring persistence of what is created.

This reframing addresses Buddhism's critique of existentialist "clinging" to self-construction. The problem is not the creating but the attachment to what is created—treating choices as building blocks of a permanent structure rather than as the self-renewing process of conscious engagement. Authentic existence, on this reading, means owning one's freedom *now* without demanding that past choices define who one must be.

It also addresses the existentialist's fear of Buddhist "dissolution." If consciousness is irreducible at each moment (as the [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism tenet]] holds), then Buddhist impermanence doesn't threaten consciousness's reality—only its permanence. You are genuinely experiencing, genuinely choosing, even if the "you" who chose yesterday is not numerically identical to the "you" choosing now. The burden lightens: no permanent self to construct or defend, yet genuine engagement remains.

The Map's framework thus suggests a synthesis: consciousness is real and irreducible moment-to-moment, but impermanent across moments. Existentialist self-creation operates within this flux—not building a monument but sustaining a flame. The self is neither a fixed essence to be discovered nor an illusion to be dispelled, but a genuine conscious perspective making real choices that shape what it becomes, without those choices hardening into destiny.
