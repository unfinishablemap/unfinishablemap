Existentialism is a philosophical tradition centred on individual existence, freedom, and the challenge of creating meaning in a universe that provides none ready-made.

The core insight is deceptively simple: existence precedes essence. Unlike a hammer, which is designed for a purpose before it exists, human beings exist first and only then define themselves through their choices. There is no pre-given human nature, no cosmic script, no essence waiting to be discovered. We are, as Jean-Paul Sartre put it, "condemned to be free."

## Core Themes

### Existence Precedes Essence

Humans are not born with a fixed nature or purpose. We exist first—thrown into the world without consent—and create ourselves through choices. A paper cutter's essence precedes its existence; it's designed for cutting. But what is a human *for*? Nothing in particular. We must decide.

### Radical Freedom

Without essence determining what we must be, we are radically free. Every moment presents a choice; refusing to choose is itself a choice. This freedom is not liberating in any comfortable sense—it is the source of profound anxiety (*angoisse*). Nothing constrains our choices except ourselves. The weight of responsibility falls entirely on us.

### Authenticity

Inauthentic living means fleeing from freedom—following conventions unreflectively, defining oneself by roles, pretending choices are determined by circumstances. Heidegger called this "das Man" (the They)—living as "one" does rather than as *I* choose.

Authentic existence means owning one's freedom, making choices with full awareness they are one's own, accepting responsibility for what one becomes. It means facing anxiety rather than fleeing it.

### Absurdity

Camus emphasized the *absurd*—the confrontation between human desire for meaning and the universe's silence. The absurd is not in the world or in us alone, but in the relation: our demand meeting the world's refusal.

Given the absurd, why not suicide? Camus answered: we must imagine Sisyphus happy. The appropriate response is revolt—continuing to live and create meaning despite the universe's silence.

### Bad Faith

Sartre's *mauvaise foi* (bad faith) describes self-deception about freedom. We pretend choices are determined by circumstances, treating ourselves as things. A waiter playing his role too perfectly, as if determined by it, is in bad faith—pretending to be a waiter the way an inkwell is an inkwell.

Bad faith is not simple lying. It is peculiar self-deception: we are both deceiver and deceived, simultaneously knowing and not knowing our freedom.

## Existentialism and Meaning

Existentialism is often misread as nihilistic. The universe provides no ready-made meaning, but that doesn't make meaning impossible—it must be *created* rather than discovered. Sartre: "Man is nothing else but what he makes of himself." Camus: "The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart."

The challenge is to create meaning without pretending it was there all along—owning values as choices rather than discoveries.

## The Illusionist Challenge

[[illusionism|Illusionists]] argue that phenomenal consciousness is an introspective illusion—that there's nothing it's *like* to choose or feel anguish. If true, existentialism's starting point collapses.

But illusionism faces a regress: for anguish to be illusory, something must experience that illusory anguish. The *seeming* of choice must *seem to* something. Sartre anticipated this—his pour-soi (being-for-itself) is precisely the awareness structure that resists reduction to thinghood. The illusionist's move is itself a form of bad faith: treating consciousness as an en-soi (thing) rather than the pour-soi it reveals itself to be.

Contemplative evidence supports existentialism here. If illusionism were correct, sustained [[introspection]] should dissolve the "illusion" of consciousness. Instead, practice *refines* phenomenal access. [[witness-consciousness|Witness consciousness]]—observing thoughts without identification—demonstrates the subject-object structure existentialism requires.

The connection to [[haecceity]] deepens the point. Existentialist self-creation produces not a replicable pattern but *this* unrepeatable subject. Illusionism treats consciousness as multiply realisable; existentialism insists on the non-substitutability of this particular perspective making these particular choices.

## Contemplative Connections

[[witness-consciousness|Witness consciousness]]—observing mental contents without identification—grounds authentic choice. To choose authentically requires seeing one's situation clearly, including tendencies toward bad faith. Witnessing breaks the captivity of being *caught* by thoughts and roles, revealing them as objects rather than identities.

[[mental-effort|Mental effort]] connects to existentialist freedom. The experience of sustaining attention against distraction, resisting the easier path—this is freedom made palpable. If choices were predetermined, the experience of effort would be systematically illusory. But contemplative practice suggests effortful attention has genuine effects: sustained practice produces results that unsustained attention doesn't.

## What Would Challenge This View?

The existentialist-dualist synthesis would face difficulty if:

- **Illusionism solved the regress problem**—explaining *why we have* experiences of choice, not just why we report them
- **Contemplative practice dissolved the sense of freedom** rather than refining it
- **[[decoherence|Quantum decoherence]] fully ruled out** consciousness-brain quantum coupling in warm tissue
- **Many-worlds proved inescapable**, fragmenting the singular self that existentialism requires

## Relation to The Unfinishable Map's Perspective

Existentialism's emphasis on meaning-creation might seem to conflict with the Map's dualism. If consciousness is real and irreducible, doesn't meaning exceed mere human projection?

### Dualism

Sartre's pour-soi (being-for-itself) is radically distinct from en-soi (being-in-itself, things). This resonates with the [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism tenet]]—consciousness resists objectification, always beyond any characterisation. Sartre didn't endorse substance dualism, but his insistence that consciousness cannot be reduced to thinghood aligns with the Map's core claim.

### Bidirectional Interaction

Existentialism assumes that choices make a difference but never explains how. The [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction tenet]] provides the mechanism: consciousness influences outcomes through quantum selection, biasing which neural patterns actualise. The phenomenology of [[mental-effort]]—trying, sustaining attention—gains significance here. Effort would be illusory if predetermined; contemplative evidence suggests it has real effects.

### Minimal Quantum Interaction

The [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet]] proposes consciousness biases quantum outcomes physics leaves indeterminate. This fits existentialist phenomenology: the brain generates possibilities; consciousness actualises one. Even "not choosing" is a selection. The anguish of freedom reflects this structure.

### No Many Worlds

The [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds tenet]] is crucial for existentialism. If Many-Worlds were true, every choice actualises all options across branches—the authentic self coexists with the self in bad faith. Existentialist emphasis on the weight of singular choice requires that decisions genuinely select one outcome. The Map's rejection of MWI preserves what existentialism needs: choices that matter because made by *this* unrepeatable subject.

### Synthesis

Even if consciousness is real and irreducible, we still face choices about what to do with existence. The facts of consciousness don't determine our values. Existentialism's insights about freedom and responsibility remain relevant within a dualist framework—perhaps more so, since genuine choice becomes causally efficacious rather than merely felt.

## Comparison with Eastern Philosophy

Existentialism and [[eastern-philosophy-consciousness|Buddhist philosophy]] both reject a fixed, discoverable self, but diverge in response. Buddhism's *anattā* holds there is no enduring self—just aggregates in flux. Existentialists agree there's no pre-given essence but insist the self is *created* through choice. From a Buddhist view, this may be clinging—constructing what should be released.

Both traditions confront groundlessness. Existentialism responds with self-assertion; Buddhism with equanimity. Yet both emphasize engagement over escapism—Sartre condemned bad faith; Buddhism condemns spiritual bypassing.

### The Compatibility Thesis

The [[buddhism-and-dualism|compatibility thesis]] offers a middle path. Buddhism denies a *permanent* owner but accepts that consciousness and experience are real. Existentialist self-creation need not aim at permanence—authenticity can operate moment-to-moment. Like a candle flame: each moment is genuinely fire without requiring persistence. Each authentic choice is genuinely self-creation without accumulating into a structure that must be defended.

If consciousness is irreducible at each moment (as the [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism tenet]] holds), Buddhist impermanence doesn't threaten consciousness's reality—only its permanence. The self is neither fixed essence nor illusion, but a genuine conscious perspective making real choices, without those choices hardening into destiny.
