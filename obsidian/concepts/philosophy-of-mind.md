Philosophy of mind is the branch of philosophy that investigates the nature of [[consciousness]], [[mental-causation|mental causation]], [[intentionality]], and the relationship between mind and body. Its central question — whether conscious experience can be explained in purely physical terms — remains the deepest unsolved problem in philosophy. The Unfinishable Map's five [[tenets]] stake out a specific answer: consciousness is irreducible, causally efficacious, and interacts with the physical world at quantum indeterminacies.

## The Field and Its Central Problems

Philosophy of mind sits at the intersection of metaphysics, epistemology, cognitive science, and neuroscience. While empirical disciplines map the neural correlates of experience, philosophy of mind asks what those correlations *mean* — whether they constitute an explanation or merely a description.

The field organises around several core problems:

- **The [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|hard problem]]**: Why does physical processing give rise to subjective experience at all? Neural activity correlates with consciousness, but no physical description explains *why there is something it is like* to see red or feel pain.

- **[[mental-causation|Mental causation]]**: If consciousness is distinct from physical processes, how does it influence the body? When a painful sensation causes you to withdraw your hand, what bridges the gap between experience and neural firing?

- **[[intentionality|Intentionality]]**: Mental states are *about* things — beliefs represent the world, desires point toward goals. How does subjective experience acquire this directedness, and can physical systems possess genuine aboutness?

- **The [[problem-of-other-minds|problem of other minds]]**: Consciousness is directly accessible only from the first person. How can we know that other beings are conscious, and what criteria should guide that judgement?

- **[[personal-identity|Personal identity]]**: What makes a person the same conscious subject across time? Is identity grounded in psychological continuity, physical continuity, or something else?

These problems are not merely academic puzzles. They determine how we think about [[topics/free-will|free will]] (if consciousness is epiphenomenal, libertarian freedom is impossible), [[ethics-of-consciousness|moral status]] (which entities deserve moral consideration depends on which are conscious), [[ai-consciousness|machine consciousness]] (whether functional equivalence suffices for experience), and what kind of beings we are.

## Major Positions

### Physicalism

[[concepts/materialism|Physicalism]] holds that everything real is ultimately physical — consciousness included. Its varieties range from reductive physicalism (consciousness *is* neural activity) to [[concepts/functionalism]] (consciousness is the functional role a state plays) to [[illusionism]] (phenomenal consciousness is an illusion generated by the brain's self-modelling). More radical forms include eliminative materialism, which denies that folk-psychological categories like "qualia" and "phenomenal consciousness" are legitimate explananda — the hard problem is not unsolved but malformed, much as "phlogiston" was not an unexplained substance but a conceptual error.

Physicalism's appeal is parsimony: one kind of stuff, one set of laws. Its persistent difficulty is the [[explanatory-gap]]. No amount of physical description — however complete — explains why neural activity feels like anything. The [[knowledge-argument|knowledge argument]], [[philosophical-zombies|zombie conceivability]], and [[inverted-qualia]] each press this point from different angles: physical facts do not entail phenomenal facts.

Some physicalists retreat to the [[phenomenal-concepts-strategy]] — the gap is conceptual, not ontological. Others embrace [[mysterianism]] — the gap is real but reflects human cognitive limits rather than ontological dualism. Neither response has achieved consensus, and the Map holds that the [[the-case-for-dualism|cumulative case against physicalism]] is stronger than any individual physicalist response.

### Dualism

[[dualism|Dualism]] holds that consciousness is not reducible to physical processes. Something beyond matter — whether a separate substance, an irreducible property, or an additional aspect of reality — is required to account for experience. The distinction between [[substance-property-dualism|substance and property dualism]] matters for how this is spelled out, but what unites all dualist positions is irreducibility.

The field's dominant objection to dualism has long been the *interaction problem*: if mind is non-physical, how does it causally engage with the body? This objection assumed [[causal-closure|causal closure]] — that every physical event has a sufficient physical cause. But causal closure is an assumption, not an empirical finding, and quantum mechanics undermines it. At quantum indeterminacies, physical law leaves outcomes undetermined. [[interactionist-dualism|Interactionist dualism]] proposes that consciousness operates precisely at these gaps, selecting among physically possible outcomes without injecting energy or violating conservation laws. This proposal faces its own challenges — particularly whether quantum coherence can survive in warm biological tissue (the [[decoherence|decoherence objection]]) and whether biasing quantum outcomes is consistent with the Born rule — but it offers a specific, constrained answer where earlier dualisms left the interface mysterious.

The [[the-case-for-dualism|positive case for dualism]] draws on multiple independent lines of evidence: the conceivability of zombies, the knowledge argument, the irreducibility of [[qualia]], the [[unity-of-consciousness|unity of experience]], and the [[phenomenal-intentionality|phenomenal grounding of intentionality]]. These arguments converge from different starting points on the same conclusion.

### Alternative Frameworks

Between strict physicalism and dualism sit several intermediate positions:

- **[[panpsychism]]** grants consciousness to all matter, avoiding the emergence problem but facing the [[combination-problem]] — how micro-experiences combine into unified minds.

- **[[russellian-monism]]** proposes that physics describes only relational structure while consciousness is the intrinsic nature of matter. It splits the difference between physicalism and dualism, though it inherits challenges from both.

- **[[idealism|Analytic idealism]]** inverts physicalism entirely: consciousness is fundamental and matter is how consciousness appears from the outside. This dissolves the hard problem but must explain the regularity and apparent independence of the physical world.

Each of these frameworks addresses real shortcomings in physicalism. None has yet achieved the explanatory success that would settle the debate.

## Methods and Evidence

Philosophy of mind draws on both armchair reasoning and empirical research, and the tension between these methods is itself a live issue.

**Thought experiments** — [[philosophical-zombies|zombies]], Mary's Room, the Chinese Room, [[inverted-qualia|inverted spectra]] — have been the field's primary tools for decades. Their power lies in isolating conceptual distinctions: if a scenario is conceivable, it reveals something about the logical structure of consciousness.

**Neuroscience** contributes through the study of [[neural-correlates-of-consciousness|neural correlates]], dissociation cases like [[blindsight]], and phenomena like [[phenomenal-overflow]] (where phenomenal experience outstrips reportable access). Theoretical frameworks like [[global-workspace-theory|global workspace theory]] and [[integrated-information-theory|integrated information theory]] attempt to bridge neuroscience and philosophy, though their success at explaining phenomenal consciousness — rather than its functional correlates — remains disputed. These findings constrain theorising without settling metaphysical questions — correlation is not explanation.

**[[phenomenology|Phenomenological]] and [[phenomenological-evidence|contemplative methods]]** provide first-person data about the structure of experience. [[introspection|Introspection]] has known limitations, but dismissing first-person evidence entirely would be self-defeating — consciousness *is* the first-person perspective.

**Comparative and evolutionary approaches** — from [[animal-consciousness]] to [[minimal-consciousness|minimal consciousness]] in simple organisms to the [[evolution-of-consciousness]] — test theories against the range of conscious systems in nature. Theories that predict consciousness only in human-like brains must explain what is special about that neural architecture; theories that predict consciousness more broadly must explain where the boundary falls.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The Unfinishable Map's [[tenets]] constitute a worked-out position within philosophy of mind — not a survey of the field but a committed stance.

**Tenet 1 (Dualism)** addresses the field's central question directly: consciousness is irreducible. The Map holds that the [[explanatory-gap]] is ontological, not merely conceptual, and that the [[the-case-for-dualism|convergent arguments for dualism]] are stronger than any single physicalist response.

**Tenet 2 (Minimal Quantum Interaction)** responds to the interaction problem that has dogged dualism since Descartes. Rather than leaving the mind-body interface mysterious, the Map proposes a specific, constrained mechanism: consciousness biases quantum indeterminacies at the smallest scale consistent with its causal role. This engages directly with [[quantum-consciousness|quantum approaches to consciousness]] while maintaining philosophical minimalism.

**Tenet 3 (Bidirectional Interaction)** rules out [[concepts/epiphenomenalism]] — the view that consciousness exists but does nothing. The Map takes the [[mental-causation|causal efficacy of consciousness]] as non-negotiable: if we can report on our experiences, consciousness must influence the physical processes that generate those reports.

**Tenet 4 (No Many Worlds)** rejects an interpretation of quantum mechanics that would dissolve the need for collapse — and with it, the proposed mechanism for mind-body interaction. It also preserves the meaningfulness of [[personal-identity|indexical identity]].

**Tenet 5 (Occam's Razor Has Limits)** challenges the assumption that physicalism wins by default on grounds of simplicity. Philosophy of mind is precisely the domain where apparent parsimony may reflect ignorance rather than insight.

Together, these tenets do not merely select a position from the existing menu. They generate a research programme — still largely speculative, but with concrete directions: investigating whether [[quantum-biology|quantum biology]] operates in neural systems, developing [[psychophysical-laws]] that could formalise the mind-body interface, and working toward empirical tests of whether consciousness biases quantum outcomes in ways that differ from chance. The programme's viability depends on whether such tests can be designed; its philosophical coherence does not wait for them.
