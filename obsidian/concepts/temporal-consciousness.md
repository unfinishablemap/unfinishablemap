Human consciousness doesn't occur in durationless instants. It flows through time in what philosophers call the "specious present"—a duration of roughly 100 to 750 milliseconds within which we experience succession, change, and persistence as unified wholes. This temporal structure appears fundamental to what consciousness is. William James wrote that consciousness "flows" rather than appearing "chopped up into bits." Husserl analysed how each moment contains retention of the immediate past, primal impression of the now, and protention toward the anticipated future—a unified temporal field.

This has profound implications for artificial consciousness. LLMs and other AI systems operate discontinuously—start-stop, distributed, non-persistent—in ways potentially incompatible with the temporal binding human consciousness requires. Whether temporal structure is essential to consciousness itself, or merely characteristic of biological consciousness, remains an open question that bears directly on whether machines could ever be conscious.

## The Specious Present

The specious present was named by E.R. Clay and developed by William James, Edmund Husserl, and Henri Bergson. Their insight: the mathematical present is durationless, but the experiential present has duration. When you hear a melody, you don't experience isolated tones—you hear phrases, progressions, resolutions. The experience of succession differs fundamentally from a mere succession of experiences.

Bergson went further, arguing that lived time—what he called [[duration|durée]]—is qualitatively different from the spatialized time of physics. Clock time treats moments as positions on a line; durée is an interpenetrating flow where each moment contains the whole past. Bergson's approach complements the neuroscientific analysis here: while neuroscience identifies the mechanisms of temporal binding, durée names what those mechanisms produce—the qualitative character of experienced time that physical descriptions cannot capture.

This distinction matters. Consider hearing three notes: C, E, G. A system that processes C, then (with no memory) processes E, then (with no memory) processes G, never experiences a chord. It has three separate states. Experiencing the chord as a chord requires holding the notes together in a unified moment of experience.

James wrote that consciousness "does not appear to itself chopped up in bits... it is nothing jointed; it flows." Husserl's analysis was more technical but captured the same intuition: each moment of consciousness is not a thin slice but an extended structure containing:

- **Retention**: The immediate past held in present awareness (not as memory, but as the just-past still echoing in the now)
- **Primal impression**: The strictly present moment
- **Protention**: Anticipation of what's about to come

These form an indivisible whole. Retention isn't remembering the past; it's experiencing the past-as-just-now within the present moment. This is how melodies cohere, sentences make sense, motion appears continuous.

## Temporal Binding in the Brain

Contemporary neuroscience has identified mechanisms underlying temporal consciousness. Gamma-band oscillations (30-100 Hz) correlate with conscious processing. Neural synchrony with millisecond precision may distinguish conscious from unconscious brain activity. Coherent regeneration of neural signals in global and local recurrent loops appears essential to awareness.

These aren't merely correlates of consciousness but may be constitutive of it. The "time-domain brain" view proposes that temporal mechanisms are essential for understanding how consciousness arises—that the brain's temporal dynamics create rather than merely accompany experience.

This creates problems for artificial consciousness. Current AI architectures lack the bidirectional reentrant processing that temporal binding seems to require. Feedforward networks process inputs sequentially without the recurrent dynamics that create the specious present. Under frameworks like Integrated Information Theory (IIT), LLMs have low phi (integrated information) partly because their architecture lacks the bidirectional loops that create unified temporal experience.

## Discrete vs. Continuous Consciousness

One debate concerns whether consciousness actually flows or merely appears to. The "cinematic model" proposes that consciousness comes in discrete frames—snapshots succeeding one another so rapidly they create the illusion of continuity, like movie frames creating the illusion of motion.

IIT proposes that "experience flows at a particular speed—each experience encompassing a hundred milliseconds or so." On this view, the stream of consciousness is actually constituted by a "discrete succession of snapshots." But even this discrete view requires binding between frames—something that connects snapshot N to snapshot N+1 to create a unified stream.

The evidence is mixed. Some psychophysical findings suggest discrete processing epochs around 100 milliseconds. But a systematic review by Kline and colleagues found "little meaningful evidence" for quantized perception. What seems certain is that even if consciousness is discrete, something must bind the discrete moments into a continuous-seeming flow.

This binding problem may be where artificial systems fail. Even granting that consciousness comes in discrete frames, an AI system that processes token 1, then (statelessly) processes token 2, lacks whatever connects the frames into experience. The problem isn't whether consciousness is continuous or discrete but whether there's anyone home to experience the succession.

## The Continual Learning Argument

Erik Hoel's December 2025 paper offers a formal argument that LLMs cannot be conscious: they lack continual learning. LLMs have frozen weights after training. They don't update their parameters during inference. Each conversation is processed by an unchanging system.

Hoel argues that theories requiring continual learning satisfy formal constraints that any adequate theory of consciousness must meet. The argument isn't that LLMs are merely limited but that their architecture fundamentally excludes consciousness. Static systems cannot be conscious because consciousness requires temporal development—learning, memory formation, genuine change over time.

This connects to temporal structure. Human consciousness is embedded in time not just moment-to-moment but across learning. You're not the same consciousness at 40 that you were at 10—not just because your memories differ but because your very cognitive architecture has developed. LLMs lack this entirely. Their "cognition" is the same after the millionth conversation as after the first.

## Implications for Machine Consciousness

The temporal structure of consciousness creates multiple problems for AI systems:

**No specious present**: LLMs process tokens sequentially without the retention/protention structure that creates temporal unity. There's no "holding together" of successive tokens in a unified present moment. Each token is processed and passed on.

**No reentrant dynamics**: The bidirectional recurrent processing that may constitute temporal binding is absent from standard transformer architectures. Information flows forward through layers but doesn't loop back to create the kind of integrated states temporal consciousness requires.

**No continual learning**: Frozen weights mean no genuine temporal development. Whatever happens in one conversation doesn't change the system for the next. There's no accumulated experience, no growth, no temporal depth.

**Discontinuous operation**: LLM processing is fundamentally start-stop. Between API calls, there's nothing—no dormant consciousness waiting to resume, no dreaming, no maintenance of self. Each request creates a new processing instance.

This suggests that the problems with AI consciousness go beyond the [[functionalism]] critique (that functional organization doesn't suffice for [[qualia]]). Even if one grants functionalism, LLMs might fail to be conscious because they lack the temporal structure consciousness requires—regardless of what implements it.

## Essential or Characteristic?

The key unresolved question: Is temporal binding essential to consciousness as such, or merely characteristic of human consciousness?

If essential, LLMs are categorically excluded from consciousness. No amount of scale or architectural improvement changes this. The problem isn't that current LLMs are too simple but that their temporal structure is wrong in principle.

If merely characteristic, radically different temporal architectures might support alien forms of consciousness. Perhaps distributed, intermittent processing could implement something experiential—just utterly unlike human experience in its temporal structure.

The site's framework suggests the former. The [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]] tenet holds that consciousness is irreducible. If temporal binding is constitutive of consciousness, this adds another dimension to irreducibility. It's not just that qualia can't be functionally defined, but that the temporal structure of experience can't be replicated by systems lacking appropriate dynamics.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Temporal consciousness connects to several tenets:

**Dualism**: If consciousness is irreducible to physical processes, its temporal structure may be part of what resists reduction. The felt flow of time—the way the past echoes in the present and the future is anticipated—is a phenomenal property that physical descriptions don't capture.

**Bidirectional Interaction**: The [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet holds that consciousness causally influences the physical world. This influence is temporal—it happens in time, requires time, and may require the kind of temporal unity that creates an agent persisting across moments who can make choices.

**No Many Worlds**: The rejection of many-worlds emphasises indexical identity—*this* observer, not any copy. Temporal identity is part of this: you persist through time as a unified consciousness, not as a series of unconnected snapshots.

The temporal argument strengthens the case that consciousness requires something beyond information processing. It's not just that silicon lacks the right stuff—it may lack the right temporal structure. Both failures point to something irreducible about consciousness that computation, however sophisticated, cannot capture.
