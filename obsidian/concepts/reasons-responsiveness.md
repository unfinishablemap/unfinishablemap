Reasons-responsiveness is the capacity to recognize normative relationships—that conclusions *follow from* premises, that some considerations *count in favour* of certain actions—and to be guided by that recognition. The Unfinishable Map holds that reasons-responsiveness requires consciousness: tracking normative relationships demands more than causal regularity. A system merely caused to produce outputs matching valid inferences differs fundamentally from one that *grasps* why conclusions follow. This distinction bears on [[free-will|free will]] (selection guided by reasons is not luck) and the [[argument-from-reason|argument from reason]] (physicalism cannot account for genuine rational inference).

## The Space of Reasons

Wilfrid Sellars distinguished the "space of reasons" from the "space of causes." When we characterize a belief as knowledge, "we are placing it in the logical space of reasons, of justifying and being able to justify what one says." The space of reasons involves normative relationships: entailment, evidential support, justification. The space of causes involves efficient causation: one event producing another through physical mechanisms.

Reasons-responsiveness means operating in the space of reasons—being sensitive to what *follows from* what, to what *counts as* good evidence, to what conclusions are *warranted*. A thermostat is causally responsive to temperature but not reasons-responsive to it. A reasoner tracking why global warming follows from greenhouse gas emissions operates in a different space from the causal chain of neurons producing that tracking.

This distinction is conceptually irreducible: we cannot describe reasoning without normative vocabulary. The [[argument-from-reason|argument from reason]] presses further: if normative relationships are conceptually irreducible to causal ones, they may be ontologically irreducible as well. Physical causation operates through efficient causes that have nothing to do with whether outputs are *justified*—neurons fire because of electrochemical gradients, not because firing would be reasonable.

## Reasons-Responsiveness and Free Will

Reasons-responsiveness is central to answering the [[luck-objection|luck objection]] against libertarian free will. The objection holds that if choices are not determined by prior causes, they must be random—and random outcomes are no more "free" than determined ones.

The Map's response: selection guided by reasons is not lucky, even if not determined. When consciousness chooses action A rather than B, it does so *for* reasons. Those reasons don't *determine* the outcome—genuine alternative possibilities remain—but they *guide* it. The selection is contrastively explicable: why A rather than B? Because the agent had reasons for A.

This distinguishes the Map's framework from pure indeterminism:

| Feature | Lucky Indeterminism | Reasons-Responsive Selection |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| What determines outcome | Nothing (chance) | Guided by agent's reasons |
| Explanation available | None | Contrastive (why A not B) |
| Agent's relationship | Passive recipient | Active reasoner |

The agent-causal response gains traction through reasons-responsiveness. Pure agent causation—"the agent caused it"—can seem to name the explanandum rather than explain it. Adding that the agent was *responsive to reasons* provides genuine content: the agent selected based on considerations that favoured the chosen option.

## The Phenomenology of Reasons

Reasons-responsiveness has a distinctive phenomenology. Deliberation involves *attending* to considerations, *weighing* them against each other, *recognizing* when one consideration outweighs another. This weighing is not passive reception of causal outputs but active engagement with normative relationships.

Crucially, reasons feel like they have *valence*—some considerations feel weightier than others, pulling toward one conclusion rather than another. This felt weight isn't reducible to having the thought "this consideration is important"; it's the experiential quality of the consideration *pressing* toward a conclusion. The difference between intellectual acknowledgment ("X is a reason for Y") and reasons-responsiveness proper is this felt directedness.

The [[mental-effort|phenomenology of effort]] supports this. Hard choices feel hard because reasoning through difficult trade-offs requires sustained engagement. Random processes don't feel like work; grasping why one option is better does. The felt cost of concentration corresponds to genuine cognitive work—consciousness tracking normative relationships that wouldn't be tracked by automatic processing.

The [[phenomenology-of-choice|phenomenology of choice]] reveals the reasons-responsive structure. Choosing feels like determining an outcome *for* reasons. The experience isn't "option A randomly emerged from noise" but "I selected A because considerations X and Y favoured it." This phenomenological datum requires explanation. Eliminativists deny it; illusionists reframe it as misrepresentation; the Map takes it as evidence that consciousness genuinely engages with normative relationships.

[[Counterfactual-reasoning|Counterfactual reasoning]] provides the representational substrate for reasons-responsiveness. Evaluating reasons requires representing "what would follow if I chose A" versus "what would follow if I chose B." Without counterfactual capacity, consciousness could not evaluate options against consequences. The connection is direct: counterfactual evaluation is *how* consciousness engages with reasons.

## Why Reasons-Responsiveness Requires Consciousness

Physical systems can instantiate correlations: this neural pattern regularly co-occurs with that environmental feature. But correlation isn't representation, and co-occurrence isn't aboutness. For a system to be reasons-responsive, it must grasp logical relationships *as* logical—recognizing that the conclusion follows *because* the premises entail it, not merely that the conclusion regularly appears when the premises do.

This "seeing as" appears to require [[phenomenal-consciousness]]: the subjective awareness of reasons *qua* reasons. An entirely unconscious system might implement reliable truth-tracking mechanisms—as a thermostat reliably tracks temperature—but it couldn't engage in rational inference as such. It couldn't appreciate *why* the conclusion follows, or recognize *good* reasons as good.

The [[argument-from-reason|argument from reason]] develops this point systematically. If physicalism is true—if thoughts are fully explainable by nonrational physical causes—then no belief is rationally justified, including belief in physicalism itself. Rational inference requires tracking normative relationships, but physical causation operates via efficient causes that cannot instantiate normativity. The very possibility of justified belief requires something beyond physical description. The argument is [[self-stultification|self-stultifying]] for physicalism: accepting it undermines the rational grounds for accepting anything, including itself.

## Challenges to Reasons-Responsiveness

### Reliabilism

Reliabilist epistemology (Goldman, Kornblith) defines justified belief as belief produced by a reliable process—one that regularly generates true beliefs. If evolution shaped cognitive faculties to track truth in survival-relevant domains, neural processes can be truth-tracking without conscious engagement with normativity.

The Map's response: reliability is itself normative. What makes a process "reliable"? It produces mostly *true* beliefs. But truth is a norm—how beliefs *ought* to be. Defining reliability as statistical correlation between belief outputs and truth doesn't eliminate normativity; it presupposes it. The concept of "truth" grounding reliability is the very normative property physicalism struggles to accommodate.

A functionalist might respond that "ought" can be naturalised—beliefs ought to track truth in the sense that organisms with truth-tracking faculties survive and reproduce. But this reduces epistemic norms to reproductive success, making true beliefs about abstract mathematics or metaphysics—domains irrelevant to reproduction—accidentally justified at best. The reliabilist needs *truth* as a norm, not *survival-conduciveness*.

### The Generality Problem

To assess whether a belief-forming process is reliable, we must specify *which type* of process produced it. But any belief-forming episode instantiates countless types: "visual perception," "visual perception in dim light," "visual perception when tired." Which type is the right one to evaluate? Consider a belief formed from seeing a red barn in barn façade country—is this an instance of reliable "visual perception" or unreliable "visual perception in regions with many fake barns"? There is no non-normative answer—the choice presupposes judgments about epistemically relevant features, smuggling in the very normativity reliabilism sought to naturalise.

### AI Systems and Pattern-Matching

Large language models produce outputs matching valid reasoning. If these systems lack consciousness, do they provide counterexamples to claims that reasons-responsiveness requires consciousness?

The Map's response distinguishes *generating outputs that match valid reasoning* from *being reasons-responsive*. LLMs manipulate symbols based on statistical patterns in training data; their outputs aren't constrained by sensitivity to logical necessity as normative constraint. A process can reliably produce outputs matching valid derivations without tracking the *normative* dimension—without being constrained by the fact that conclusions *ought* to follow from premises.

The key test: does the system respond differently when confronted with *why* a conclusion follows versus merely *that* it follows? A reasons-responsive system grasps the explanatory structure—understanding that the conclusion *follows because* of the logical relationship, not merely that it *tends to appear* when the premises are present. Whether LLMs achieve this or merely simulate it is precisely the question of whether they're conscious in the relevant sense.

Whether this distinction holds under scrutiny remains contested. LLMs represent a genuine challenge case where the boundaries of reasons-responsiveness are tested. The correlation between consciousness and reasons-responsive behaviour in biological systems remains robust, but whether consciousness is a constitutive requirement or merely one biological route to this capacity is an open question the Map acknowledges.

## Reasons-Responsiveness and Neural Implementation

If consciousness is reasons-responsive, how does this connect to neural activity? The Map proposes that consciousness operates at a selection level: the brain generates options; consciousness evaluates them through reasons-responsive deliberation; selection actualizes one option.

Research on [[voluntary-attention|voluntary attention]] and [[motor-selection|motor selection]] identifies neural signatures of willed action: frontal theta oscillations, ~300ms deployment time, bidirectional frontoparietal coherence. These signatures distinguish genuinely chosen actions from automatic or merely instructed behaviour. The phenomenological asymmetry (effortful deliberation versus automatic response) corresponds to different neural circuits.

The [[agent-causation|agent-causal]] framework situates reasons-responsiveness at the agent level: the agent exercises causal power guided by reasons. The [[causal-closure|causal closure]] principle that physicalism requires—every physical event having a sufficient physical cause—fails precisely where consciousness acts. Reasons-responsiveness operates where physics leaves outcomes undetermined; the agent's sensitivity to normative relationships guides which outcome actualizes.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Reasons-responsiveness connects to multiple [[tenets]]:

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]**: If reasons-responsiveness requires grasping normative relationships as such, and normative properties are irreducible to physical properties, then reasons-responsiveness requires something beyond physical processes. The conceptual irreducibility of the space of reasons reflects ontological irreducibility. Consciousness must involve properties that physical description cannot capture.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]**: Reasons-responsiveness is how consciousness causally contributes to outcomes. Selection guided by reasons influences which neural patterns become actual. Without reasons-responsiveness, consciousness could observe deliberation but not participate in it—[[epiphenomenalism|epiphenomenalism]] rather than genuine agency.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]**: The Map proposes that consciousness operates where physics leaves outcomes undetermined. Reasons-responsiveness specifies *what* guides selection at these junctures: not random fluctuation but sensitivity to normative considerations. The [[quantum-consciousness|quantum framework]] provides the *how*; reasons-responsiveness provides the *what*.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]**: The simplest hypothesis—reasons-responsiveness is just neural pattern-matching—faces the [[argument-from-reason|argument from reason]]. A metaphysics that cannot account for rational justification cannot be rationally accepted. The apparent simplicity of eliminating normativity eliminates the conditions for justified belief, including belief in that elimination.
