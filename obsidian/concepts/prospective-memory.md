When you leave home intending to buy milk, something must hold that intention during your commute so it "pops" into awareness when you pass the shop. This is prospective memory (PM)—remembering to perform planned actions in the future. Unlike retrospective memory (remembering what happened), PM is about remembering what to do. The capacity to maintain intentions across time, simulate future scenarios, and execute delayed plans represents a distinctively conscious form of cognition that connects intimately to free will and agency.

Prospective memory matters for The Unfinishable Map's framework because it complements [[autonoetic-consciousness|autonoetic consciousness]]'s pastward mental time travel with futureward projection. If consciousness enables bidirectional temporal self-projection, this isn't merely a capacity for episodic replay but an active power to shape future action. The phenomenology of intention formation, the "pop" of prospective retrieval, and the causal influence of future simulation on present decisions all suggest consciousness participates in directing behaviour—not merely witnessing it.

## Types of Prospective Memory

Prospective memory divides into three types based on retrieval triggers:

**Time-based PM**: Remembering to act at a specific time (take medication at 3 PM). Requires internally generated monitoring.

**Event-based PM**: Remembering to act when a cue occurs (give a message when you see the colleague). External events trigger retrieval.

**Activity-based PM**: Remembering to act after completing another activity (lock the door after leaving). Depends on recognising completion states.

## Episodic Future Thinking

The most consciousness-intensive form of future-oriented cognition is **episodic future thinking** (EFT)—the capacity to imagine specific events that you may experience in the future. When you mentally rehearse a job interview, plan a holiday, or worry about tomorrow's meeting, you project yourself forward in time and inhabit a simulated scenario with first-person phenomenology.

### The Constructive Simulation Hypothesis

Schacter and Addis (2007) proposed that EFT and episodic memory share a common mechanism: flexible retrieval and recombination of past experience elements. Both engage the same brain network (hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate), though the hippocampus shows *greater* activation during future simulation, reflecting additional constructive demands.

Mental time travel is genuinely bidirectional—a unified capacity for temporal self-projection rather than separate remembering and imagining faculties.

### Patient KC: The Double Deficit

[[autonoetic-consciousness|Patient KC]] couldn't remember events from his personal past *or* imagine events in his personal future—when asked what he would do tomorrow, his mind was "blank." This double deficit confirms that pastward and futureward projection share a common foundation: autonoetic consciousness. The self that remembers yesterday is the same self that imagines tomorrow.

## The Phenomenology of Futurity

### The "Pop" Phenomenon

A striking feature of everyday PM is the **spontaneous "pop"** of intentions into awareness. You're walking home thinking about something else, and suddenly "buy milk" appears—triggered by some cue processed below awareness.

Einstein and McDaniel (1990) identified two retrieval routes: resource-intensive conscious **monitoring** versus automatic **spontaneous retrieval**. The pop phenomenon highlights that consciousness bookends the process (forming the intention, receiving the retrieval) while something unconscious bridges the gap.

### Futuricity: The Temporal Quale

When you imagine a future event, it carries a distinctive phenomenal character—**futuricity** (our term for this temporal quale), a felt sense of possibility and "not yet." Just as remembered events carry pastness, imagined future events carry this phenomenal marker of projected possibility.

Futuricity differs from pastness: memories represent what happened; future simulations represent what might happen. Both involve autonoetic consciousness, but the modal character differs—and this difference appears in phenomenology, not just propositional content.

### The Impossibility of Anticipatory Qualia

The [[temporal-asymmetry-remembering-anticipating|asymmetry between remembering and anticipating]] runs deeper than phenomenological difference—it may mark a conceptual impossibility. The pastness quale tracks *causal contact*: when you remember your wedding, the feeling of having-been-there arises because that event actually caused your present brain states. The future, having caused nothing yet, leaves no traces to contact.

This explains why the "pop" of prospective retrieval differs from episodic re-experiencing. When "buy milk" surfaces as you pass the shop, you don't *re-experience* forming that plan—it's reminding, not reliving.

Three implications follow:

1. **Consciousness operates through traces.** Episodic memory's pastness quale marks causal contact; future simulation manipulates elements derived from past traces but cannot contact future reality.

2. **Future simulation is imagination repurposed.** Memory and future thinking share neural substrate but produce different phenomenal products because memory has actual events as causal source while future simulation has only abstracted patterns.

3. **The void is structural.** Pre-experience—genuinely re-experiencing events that haven't occurred—is conceptually incoherent. Minds can access what has touched them but cannot reach forward to what hasn't.

### Pre-Made Thoughts

Most spontaneous future thoughts are "pre-made"—re-iterations of previously constructed scenarios rather than novel constructions. Mental time travel, in both directions, operates partly through cached simulations; initial construction requires significant resources while subsequent retrievals are more automatic.

## Intention Formation and Free Will

### Distal vs. Proximal Intentions

Libet's experiments studied *proximal* intentions—immediate decisions to move now. Prospective memory involves *distal* intentions—decisions about future action. Even if proximal intentions don't cause their actions, distal intentions may be causally efficacious: when you decide Monday to attend a meeting Friday, that distal intention causally contributes to your arrival.

This matters for [[agent-causation|agent causation]]. The libertarian needn't claim every proximal motor command involves conscious intervention—what matters is that conscious planning participates in shaping the trajectory of action.

### Future Simulation Influences Decisions

EFT causally influences behaviour: vividly imagining future consequences reduces temporal discounting, decreases impulsive decision-making, and improves goal-directed behaviour (Szpunar, Spreng, & Schacter, 2014). If conscious simulation of future scenarios shapes present decisions, consciousness participates in directing action exactly as the [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet proposes.

## Working Memory and Future Simulation

EFT requires [[working-memory|working memory]] for holding, manipulating, and binding elements into coherent simulated scenarios. The [[working-memory#The Maintenance/Manipulation Distinction|maintenance/manipulation asymmetry]] applies: storing an intention may be automatic, but actively simulating a future scenario requires conscious engagement. This explains why PM failures often involve retrieval rather than storage.

The [[specious-present|specious present]] may constrain future simulation's temporal scope, with the "extended present" (Conway et al. 2016) reflecting what working memory can sustain with phenomenal vividness.

## The Illusionist Challenge

[[illusionism|Illusionism]] challenges whether futuricity is genuine phenomenology or introspective confabulation. Three responses:

**The regress problem.** If futuricity is an illusion, something must experience this illusion—the seeming-to-project-forward must seem *to* something. Either that something has genuine experience, or it too merely seems to experience (generating a regress).

**Introspective stability.** When you attend carefully to imagining a future event, the futuricity doesn't dissolve—it intensifies. Closer attention reveals rather than dissolves the phenomenon.

**The asymmetry argument.** Pastness and futuricity feel categorically different as phenomenal characters. If these were mere cognitive tags, why would the same information accessed through [[episodic-memory|episodic memory]] versus future simulation have radically different texture?

## Contemplative Evidence

**[[witness-consciousness|Witness consciousness]] and future thought.** Meditators report observing future simulations arise as contents within awareness—the anticipated scenario appears with its futuricity intact while the witness remains present. This capacity to observe the possibility-character of future thoughts suggests futuricity is a genuine phenomenal feature.

**Intention and volition.** Advanced meditators report that intention formation has a distinctive phenomenology that survives contemplative scrutiny rather than dissolving under examination.

**The worry-obsession contrast.** Contemplative practice reveals that anxious future simulation differs phenomenologically from deliberate prospective planning—worry has a "sticky," compulsive quality that relaxed future thinking lacks.

## Process Philosophy Perspective

Whitehead's process philosophy illuminates prospective consciousness. Each actual occasion has a "subjective aim"—inherent directedness toward its own completion involving selection among future possibilities. Prospective memory, on this view, is consciousness accessing its own future-directed character.

Future simulation involves prehending "eternal objects" (pure potentials) not yet instantiated—the futuricity quale marks this distinctive mode of relating to what might become rather than what has occurred. The spontaneous "pop" of intentions isn't mechanical triggering but the occasion's felt reception of newly relevant possibilities. Intention formation is a form of concrescence—constituting a new experiential fact that will influence subsequent occasions.

## What Would Challenge This View?

1. **Futuricity dissolving under analysis.** If careful [[introspection]] revealed the "not yet" character to be entirely inferential rather than immediately given. Currently, attention intensifies rather than decomposes the phenomenon.

2. **Memory-future indistinguishability.** If remembering and future simulation proved phenomenologically identical under controlled conditions. Current evidence shows they feel categorically different even when matched for content.

3. **Contemplative traditions reporting dissolution.** If advanced meditators consistently reported that future-oriented phenomenology disappears upon close examination. Currently, contemplative evidence suggests the opposite.

4. **EFT effects without phenomenology.** If the behavioral benefits of future simulation occurred equally when processed unconsciously. Current evidence suggests conscious vividness predicts behavioral effects.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Prospective memory and future-oriented consciousness support all five foundational commitments.

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]**: The phenomenology of future simulation involves irreducible qualia—futuricity, the self projected forward, the possibility character of imagined events. Neural activity correlates with future thinking, but correlation doesn't explain why there is something it is like to imagine tomorrow. The [[illusionism|illusionist]] response faces the regress problem: the illusion of anticipating requires some experience in which to be illuded.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]**: Intention formation may involve the same [[attention-as-interface|attention-mediated quantum mechanisms]] proposed for other conscious selection. If [[mental-effort|mental effort]] operates through quantum Zeno-type mechanisms, intention formation involves consciousness selecting among superposed neural patterns representing possible futures. The [[decoherence]] objection applies, but biological quantum effects demonstrate that evolution can exploit quantum phenomena.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]**: Evidence that EFT reduces temporal discounting and improves goal-directed behaviour suggests conscious simulation causally shapes action—precisely the downward causation the Map proposes. Even if Libet-style challenges undermine proximal motor commands, distal intentions formed through conscious planning causally shape subsequent behaviour trajectories.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]**: Future simulation presupposes that only one future will actualise. Deliberation makes sense only if alternatives are genuinely exclusive—why deliberate if all options will occur? The phenomenology of intention formation presupposes single-history metaphysics. This connects to [[haecceity]]: the future you're planning for is *your* future, and in branching scenarios "your" future becomes indeterminate.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]**: The "simpler" computational account fails to explain futuricity as immediately given phenomenal character (not merely a timestamp). Evidence that conscious vividness predicts behavioral effects suggests phenomenology isn't epiphenomenal decoration but causally relevant.

**Agent Causation**: Intention formation is paradigmatically what [[agent-causation|agent causation]] describes—deciding now what to do later, with the intention persisting, retrieving, and guiding action. This causal chain is exactly what libertarian free will requires. The [[motor-selection|motor selection]] research suggests even final motor execution may involve the same attention-mediated selection mechanisms, unifying voluntary action under a single interface model.
