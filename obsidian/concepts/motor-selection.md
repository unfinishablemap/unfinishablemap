Motor control provides a second domain—beyond attention—where consciousness might select among neural options through the quantum Zeno mechanism. Recent neuroscience reveals striking parallels: willed movements engage frontal theta oscillations just as willed attention does, voluntary action takes approximately 300ms to initiate (matching willed attention deployment), and neural systems distinguish "willed" from "instructed" motor action with different signatures. The challenge from Libet's experiments—that the brain "decides" before we're aware—has been substantially weakened by evidence that the readiness potential is noise rather than decision. Motor selection strengthens the site's framework by extending quantum Zeno from one domain to two.

## The Attention-Motor Parallel

The [[attention-as-interface|attention as interface hypothesis]] proposes that consciousness operates through attention, using the quantum Zeno effect to hold desired neural patterns stable. Motor control shows the same structure:

| Feature | Willed Attention | Willed Movement |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Neural signature | Frontal theta oscillations | Frontal theta oscillations |
| Deployment time | ~300ms | ~300ms |
| Willed vs instructed | Distinct signatures | Distinct signatures |
| Direction of coherence | Bidirectional frontoparietal | Bidirectional frontoparietal |
| Phenomenology | Feels effortful | Feels effortful |

This parallel is not coincidental. Both attention and motor control require selection among competing options—what to attend to, what to do. If consciousness contributes by selecting, the mechanism should be similar across domains. The same frontal theta oscillations that distinguish willed from instructed attention also distinguish willed from instructed movement.

## The Libet Challenge—and Its Dissolution

Benjamin Libet's 1983 experiments posed an apparent challenge to conscious motor control. He found:

1. **Readiness potential** (RP) begins ~550ms before movement
2. **Conscious awareness** of intention ("W" time) occurs only ~200ms before
3. Therefore, the brain "decides" ~350ms before we become aware

If the brain decides unconsciously and consciousness merely observes, motor control seems to exclude conscious selection. Many took this as evidence against [[free-will|free will]].

### Schurger's Stochastic Reinterpretation

Aaron Schurger's 2012 model fundamentally reframes Libet. He showed the readiness potential may be an artifact of averaging stochastic neural noise—not a signature of unconscious decision.

The model: leaky stochastic accumulator crossing a threshold. Movement occurs when random fluctuations happen to reach threshold. Averaging across trials produces the RP shape, but each individual trial reflects noise, not decision. As Schurger puts it, the RP "may reflect ongoing stochastic fluctuations in neural activity that favor the spontaneous emission of a movement at certain times more so than at others."

This "takes the sting out of the Libet argument." The RP doesn't show the brain deciding before consciousness—it shows noise accumulating until movement becomes appropriate. What consciousness contributes is determining *when to let* that threshold-crossing happen: the selection of the right moment, not the generation of the urge.

### Surgical Evidence

Sjöberg (2024) provides additional evidence from patients with surgical resection of the supplementary motor area (SMA)—the region generating the RP. If the RP reflected genuine volition, removing it should impair voluntary action. It doesn't. Patients with SMA resection retain their sense of voluntary action.

Sjöberg concludes that Libet's findings are "completely irrelevant" to the free will debate. The RP tracks motor preparation, not decision-making. Consciousness contributes elsewhere.

## Where Intention Originates

Desmurget's 2009 neurosurgical studies reveal where conscious motor intention actually emerges—and it's not where the RP is generated.

### The Parietal Dissociation

Stimulating different brain regions produces strikingly different effects:

| Region | Effect of Stimulation |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Inferior parietal** | Conscious intention to move *without* movement |
| **Inferior parietal** (higher intensity) | False belief of having moved (no EMG activity) |
| **Premotor cortex** | Actual movement *without* awareness |

This is a double dissociation: parietal regions produce the experience of intention without motor output; premotor regions produce motor output without the experience of intention. The phenomenology of "deciding to move" is separable from the motor machinery that executes movement.

### Selection vs Execution

This dissociation maps directly onto the site's framework. Consciousness contributes at the *selection* level—choosing what to do—not at the *execution* level—how to do it. The parietal cortex, where intention emerges, is part of the posterior "hot zone" that recent research associates with conscious content. The premotor cortex executes selected patterns without requiring consciousness for each muscle command.

This explains why we experience choosing to reach for a cup but don't experience choosing the firing patterns of individual motor neurons. Consciousness operates at the level of action selection; execution is delegated to automatic systems. The quantum Zeno mechanism would operate at the selection interface, not the execution machinery.

## Neural Signatures of Motor Selection

### Willed vs Instructed Movement

Research on voluntary attention (Bengson 2019) found that willed attention—internally generated rather than externally cued—engages distinct neural mechanisms: frontal theta oscillations and bidirectional frontoparietal coherence. Motor control shows similar distinctions.

When subjects choose what to do (willed) versus follow instructions (instructed):

| Feature | Willed Action | Instructed Action |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| Frontal theta | Increased | Standard |
| Frontoparietal coherence | Bidirectional | Primarily feedforward |
| Decision processes | Additional frontal recruitment | Minimal frontal involvement |
| Timeline | ~300ms | ~100ms |

The bidirectional coherence finding is particularly significant. During willed action, information flows both ways between frontal executive regions and parietal motor planning regions. During instructed action, information flows primarily from instruction to execution. Willed action involves genuine neural "deliberation"; instructed action is more like relay.

### The 300ms Decision Window

Both willed attention and willed motor action take approximately 300ms to deploy—versus ~100ms for automatic responses. This temporal signature may reflect the time consciousness requires to engage the selection mechanism.

In the quantum Zeno framework, 300ms would be the time required for:
1. Candidate neural patterns to enter superposition
2. Consciousness to engage through attention/intention
3. Repeated observation to stabilize the selected pattern
4. The pattern to reach threshold for execution

The longer timeline for willed versus automatic action reflects real selection, not just relay of external commands.

## The Basal Ganglia Selection Mechanism

The basal ganglia offer another candidate site for motor selection—and their architecture maps remarkably well onto the site's framework.

### The Brake-Release Model

The basal ganglia's output is tonically inhibitory—it continuously suppresses motor programs. Action selection works by *releasing the brake* on desired programs while maintaining inhibition on alternatives:

- **Direct pathway** (D1 receptors, dopamine-excited): Releases brake on selected action
- **Indirect pathway** (D2 receptors): Maintains brake on competing actions
- **Result**: One motor program is disinhibited while alternatives remain suppressed

This is precisely a selection mechanism. The brain generates multiple competing motor programs; the basal ganglia determine which one "wins" by selective disinhibition. Consciousness might operate at this selection point—biasing which program is released.

### Parallel to Thalamic Gating

The [[attention-as-interface|attention as interface hypothesis]] identifies thalamic gating as a candidate site for attentional selection. The basal ganglia play an analogous role for motor selection:

| Domain | Selection Site | Mechanism |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| Attention | Thalamus | Gating sensory signals to cortex |
| Motor | Basal ganglia | Releasing brake on motor programs |

Both involve selective disinhibition rather than direct activation. Both present candidate interfaces where consciousness might bias selection without controlling execution.

## "Free Won't": The Veto Model

Libet himself proposed that consciousness contributes through *veto*—the ability to stop prepared actions rather than initiate them. This "free won't" model preserves a role for consciousness within the constraints of his timing data.

The veto model aligns with the selection framework. Even if motor preparation begins unconsciously, consciousness might select by:
1. Allowing prepared actions to proceed (non-intervention)
2. Vetoing prepared actions (active suppression)

The ~200ms between awareness and action in Libet's data is enough time for veto. Selection doesn't require initiating action from scratch—it can operate by permitting or blocking what the brain proposes.

However, the Schurger reinterpretation suggests veto is not the whole story. If the RP is noise rather than decision, consciousness might contribute earlier—selecting when to let noise cross threshold, not merely vetoing after decision.

## Sense of Agency and Efference Copy

Motor selection produces a distinctive phenomenology: the sense of agency. We experience ourselves as the authors of our movements. This sense depends on efference copy—the brain's prediction of sensory consequences of motor commands.

### The Predictive Mechanism

When you move your arm:
1. Motor command is generated
2. Efference copy predicts expected sensory feedback
3. Actual feedback is compared to prediction
4. Match produces sense of agency; mismatch produces sense of passivity

Disrupted efference copy produces pathological experiences—alien hand syndrome, passivity experiences in schizophrenia—where movements feel imposed rather than willed.

### Interface Confirmation

From the site's perspective, efference copy may be how consciousness "reads" whether selection succeeded. The selection mechanism operates at the decision point; efference copy provides feedback about whether the selected action occurred as intended. This closes the loop: consciousness selects, the brain executes, and the match between intention and outcome confirms agency.

## Relation to Site Perspective

### Dualism

The dissociation between intention (parietal) and execution (premotor) supports the site's [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]] tenet. If consciousness were identical to neural processing, there would be no principled distinction between experiencing intention and executing movement—both would be "just neurons." The double dissociation suggests something contributes to intention that is not identical to motor execution machinery.

### Minimal Quantum Interaction

Motor selection satisfies the [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] constraint. Consciousness doesn't generate movement energy or override physics—it biases selection among competing motor programs at quantum indeterminacies. The basal ganglia brake-release mechanism offers a site where small influences could determine which program is disinhibited.

### Bidirectional Interaction

Motor control is where [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] becomes most obvious. We move our bodies. Words appear on screens. The conversation about consciousness exists because consciousness can influence motor output. If consciousness were epiphenomenal, we could not be discussing it. Motor selection is bidirectional interaction in action.

### No Many Worlds

The quantum Zeno mechanism requires genuine collapse. If all branches actualize (many-worlds interpretation), there's nothing for consciousness to select—motor programs would execute in all branches, and consciousness would merely find itself in one. The [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]] tenet preserves motor selection as genuine choice, not branch-discovery.

## Two Domains, One Mechanism

The parallel between attention and motor control suggests a unified framework:

**Consciousness selects among neural options through the quantum Zeno effect.** This mechanism operates wherever:
1. Competing neural patterns exist in superposition
2. Attention/intention can engage
3. Selection has consequences for behavior

Attention and motor control are two such domains. Others may exist—memory retrieval, imagination, decision-making—wherever consciousness seems to "choose" among options the brain presents.

The ~300ms timeline, frontal theta signature, and bidirectional coherence appear in both domains because they reflect the *same underlying mechanism*. Consciousness doesn't have separate tools for attention and action; it has one selection mechanism that operates wherever the brain provides the right interface.
