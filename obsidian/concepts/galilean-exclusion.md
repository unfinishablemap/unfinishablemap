The Galilean exclusion is the foundational methodological move by which modern science removed subjective experience from its domain of inquiry. Galileo's distinction between primary qualities (shape, size, motion, number — mathematically describable properties of objects themselves) and secondary qualities (colour, taste, warmth, sound-as-experienced — properties existing only in the experiencing subject) did not merely organise phenomena. It defined what would count as scientifically real. Primary qualities stayed; secondary qualities were set aside as subjective projections irrelevant to physics. This decision made modern science possible. It also made the [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|hard problem of consciousness]] structurally inevitable.

## The Distinction and Its Logic

In *The Assayer* (1623), Galileo argued that qualities like heat, colour, and taste do not belong to external objects but arise from the interaction between objects and perceiving subjects. A feather tickles, but ticklishness is not a property of the feather — it exists only in the person being touched. By the same reasoning, warmth is not in the fire; it is in the hand that feels the fire.

What remains when subjective qualities are stripped away is the mathematical skeleton: particles in motion, describable by geometry and number. Galileo's insight was that this skeleton is sufficient for physics. You do not need to know what red looks like to predict the wavelength of light. You do not need to feel heat to calculate thermal dynamics. The subjective dimension is expendable — for physics.

Descartes formalised the exclusion further. His division of reality into *res extensa* (extended, measurable substance) and *res cogitans* (thinking substance) made the Galilean move explicit: mind and matter are ontologically separate domains. Physics governs *res extensa*; experience belongs to *res cogitans* and falls outside physical description. What began as a methodological convenience in Galileo became, in Descartes, a metaphysical architecture.

## Why the Exclusion Worked

The Galilean exclusion was spectacularly productive. By restricting attention to observer-independent, quantifiable properties, physics achieved a universality that no prior knowledge system had managed. Chemistry, biology, and eventually neuroscience adopted the same template: describe the world in third-person terms, eliminate subjective variation, seek laws that hold regardless of who observes.

This success was not accidental. Subjectivity introduces noise. Different observers experience colour differently. Pain varies between individuals. Taste is culturally inflected. By excluding all of this, science gained precision, repeatability, and cumulative progress. The exclusion was a filter that separated signal from noise — where "signal" was defined as whatever could be mathematically described and experimentally controlled.

The filter's success reinforced itself. Each new scientific triumph confirmed that the observer-independent approach works. Over centuries, what began as a methodological decision hardened into an implicit metaphysics: the mathematically describable properties are not merely useful but *real*, while the excluded qualities are derivative, reducible, or illusory.

## The Problem When Consciousness Is the Target

The Galilean exclusion generates a distinctive difficulty when science turns to study consciousness itself. [[qualia|Qualia]] — the redness of red, the painfulness of pain — are precisely the secondary qualities Galileo excluded. They are what consciousness *consists of*. Asking a methodology designed to work without subjectivity to explain subjectivity creates a structural mismatch.

This is not a claim about the limits of scientific effort or intelligence. It is a claim about the relationship between a method and its founding assumptions. A sieve that filters out sand cannot then be used to study sand — not because sieves are poorly made, but because filtering out sand is what the sieve *does*. The Galilean exclusion filters out phenomenal quality. A science built on that exclusion faces a structural obstacle when phenomenal quality becomes the target.

The [[explanatory-gap]] between neural description and felt experience gains sharper diagnosis in this light. The gap is not merely a hard empirical problem awaiting further research. It reflects the fact that the very framework of scientific explanation was constructed by removing from its domain the phenomenon now under investigation. As Evan Thompson argues in *Mind in Life* (2007), modern science inherited from Galileo the assumption that mathematical-physical description exhausts what is objectively real. Everything excluded from that description — including experience — becomes either reducible to physics or scientifically invisible.

## Not a Discovery but a Decision

A crucial distinction: Galileo did not *discover* that secondary qualities are unreal. He *decided* to exclude them from physics and found that physics worked magnificently without them. This tells us that mathematical physics can describe physical structure while ignoring consciousness. It does not tell us that consciousness is nothing beyond physical structure.

The confusion between methodological exclusion and metaphysical absence underlies much of the consciousness debate. When materialists argue that everything real is physical, they often implicitly rely on the Galilean exclusion: if physics has never needed subjective qualities to explain anything, then subjective qualities must not be fundamental features of reality. But this reasoning is circular. Physics never needed subjective qualities because it was *designed* not to need them. The absence of consciousness from physical description reflects a methodological choice, not an empirical finding.

This point cuts against both extreme positions. It tells the materialist that the absence of consciousness from physics does not prove consciousness is physical. It tells the mysterian that the difficulty of explaining consciousness scientifically may reflect the method's structure rather than any intrinsic ineffability of the phenomenon.

## The Exclusion in Contemporary Debates

The Galilean exclusion surfaces repeatedly in contemporary philosophy of mind, often without being named.

The [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|hard problem]] is, in significant part, a consequence of the exclusion. David Chalmers's formulation — why is physical processing accompanied by subjective experience? — presupposes that physical description and experiential description are different in kind. They are different in kind because Galileo made them so. The hard problem becomes less mysterious (though no less real) when understood as arising from a methodological architecture rather than from an intrinsic feature of nature.

Theories of consciousness face a dilemma traceable to the exclusion. Approaches that remain within the Galilean framework (functionalism, computationalism, Global Workspace Theory) can describe the structural and functional correlates of consciousness with increasing precision. But they struggle to bridge the gap between structure and quality — precisely because the framework was built by excluding quality. Approaches that break from the framework (panpsychism, [[neurophenomenology]], radical enactivism) gain resources for addressing experience directly, but risk losing the scientific rigour that the exclusion made possible.

The [[consciousness-and-the-authority-of-mathematics|authority of mathematics]] debate also reflects the exclusion's legacy. Mathematics excels at describing the primary qualities Galileo kept. Its success with structure does not establish its sovereignty over the secondary qualities he excluded.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The Unfinishable Map's [[tenets]] engage with the Galilean exclusion at multiple points.

**Dualism**: The Map holds that consciousness is not reducible to physical processes. The Galilean exclusion provides historical context for why this claim is not merely stubborn resistance to science but a recognition of structural limits built into the scientific method. If the method was designed to work without subjectivity, the failure of that method to explain subjectivity is not surprising — it is expected.

**Bidirectional Interaction**: If consciousness causally influences the physical world, then the Galilean exclusion created an incomplete picture of physical causation. A science that excludes consciousness from its descriptions will miss any causal contributions consciousness makes. The Map's insistence on bidirectional interaction implies that the exclusion does not merely leave consciousness unexplained — it leaves *physics* incomplete in domains where consciousness acts.

**Occam's Razor Has Limits**: The apparent simplicity of materialist accounts of consciousness is purchased by the Galilean exclusion. Excluding the phenomenon and then declaring it reducible to what remains is simplicity through omission. Genuine parsimony requires accounting for all the phenomena, including the ones Galileo set aside.
