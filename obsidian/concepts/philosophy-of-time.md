Philosophy of time asks fundamental questions about time's nature: Does the past exist? Is there an objective present? Does time flow, or is "flow" an illusion? These questions matter for consciousness because the relationship between subjective temporal experience and physical time remains deeply puzzling. If consciousness participates in [[collapse-and-time|quantum collapse]]—and collapse introduces time's arrow—then consciousness may be implicated in the structure of time itself, not merely a passenger traveling through it.

This site's framework proposes that consciousness helps constitute temporal structure through its role in collapse. To understand this proposal, we need the conceptual apparatus philosophers have developed for thinking about time.

## McTaggart's A-Series and B-Series

John McTaggart (1908) introduced a fundamental distinction that still structures debates about time.

**The A-series** orders events as past, present, and future. Events move through these positions: what was future becomes present, then past. The A-series is *tensed*—"the meeting is tomorrow" changes truth-value as time passes.

**The B-series** orders events as earlier-than and later-than. These relations are permanent: if X is earlier than Y, it always is. The B-series is *tenseless*—"X is earlier than Y" doesn't change truth-value.

McTaggart argued that time essentially requires the A-series (real change, genuine flow), but that the A-series is self-contradictory. His paradox: every event must be past, present, and future—but these are incompatible properties. If we say "E is present, was future, will be past," we've only pushed the problem back (those new claims are themselves tensed, requiring further tensed analysis, generating infinite regress).

Contemporary philosophers respond in two ways:

**A-theorists** accept that time requires the A-series but deny McTaggart's paradox shows genuine contradiction. The indexical nature of tense (like "here" for space) doesn't generate contradiction—it just marks perspective.

**B-theorists** accept McTaggart's argument against the A-series but deny time requires it. The B-series alone suffices. Tensed language is convenient but reducible to tenseless relations plus indexical reference.

## The Three Main Ontological Positions

### Presentism

Only the present exists. Past events are gone—not somewhere else, but ontologically nothing. Future events don't exist yet. The dinosaurs have "slipped out of reality" (though our present concepts of them persist).

**Strengths**: Matches naive temporal experience. The past feels *over*; the future feels *open*. Presentism takes this phenomenology seriously.

**Challenges**: What makes past-tensed statements true? If dinosaurs don't exist, what makes "dinosaurs existed" true? And special relativity seems to eliminate absolute simultaneity—there's no universal "now" for presentism to privilege.

### Eternalism (Block Universe)

All times exist equally. Past, present, and future are like spatial locations—1066 exists just as 2026 does, merely "elsewhere" in the block. Temporal flow is illusion; "now" is merely indexical (like "here").

**Strengths**: Fits special relativity naturally. No need for a privileged present. Past-tense truth is straightforward—the dinosaurs exist at earlier coordinates.

**Challenges**: Temporal phenomenology seems illusory. The vivid difference between past, present, and future becomes merely perspectival. Some find this eliminates genuine change and threatens free will (the future already exists).

### Growing Block (Growing Past)

Past and present exist; future doesn't yet. The block "grows" as time passes, with the present as its leading edge. Dinosaurs are real (at earlier coordinates), but your future death doesn't yet exist.

**Strengths**: Preserves objective present (A-theory intuitions) while explaining past-tense truth (eternalist-style). The future is genuinely open.

**Challenges**: What is the mechanism of "growth"? If past and present exist, why not future? The boundary seems arbitrary without independent justification.

## A-Theory vs. B-Theory

The A-series/B-series distinction crosscuts the ontological positions:

| Position | Ontology | Theory |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Presentism | Only present | A-theory |
| Growing Block | Past + present | A-theory |
| Eternalism | All times | Usually B-theory |
| Moving Spotlight | All times + moving "now" | A-theory eternalism |

**Moving Spotlight Theory** is an interesting hybrid: all times exist (eternalism), but the present is objectively distinguished as "illuminated." This distinction changes—the spotlight moves. This preserves eternalist ontology while maintaining objective temporal flow.

## Time in Physics

### Classical Physics

Newton's absolute time flows "without relation to anything external"—a universal container within which events occur. All observers agree on simultaneity and duration.

### Special Relativity

Einstein's 1905 theory eliminates absolute simultaneity. Whether two events are simultaneous depends on the observer's reference frame. This seems to favor eternalism: if "now" varies by observer, no observer-independent present exists.

But interpretations differ:
- **Minkowski spacetime**: The 4D block is fundamental. Time is a dimension like space.
- **Presentist responses**: There may be a privileged frame (though physics doesn't reveal it). Or relativistic "present" is an extended hyperplane, not a point.
- **Growing block responses**: Growth occurs along a privileged foliation, even if physics doesn't uniquely identify it.

### Quantum Mechanics

Quantum mechanics reintroduces temporal asymmetry. The Schrödinger equation is time-symmetric, but [[measurement-problem|measurement/collapse]] introduces irreversibility. Where does this arrow come from?

**Collapse realism**: Collapse is a genuine process introducing objective temporal direction. This supports A-theory—something genuinely changes when superposition becomes definite outcome.

**Decoherence**: Apparent collapse reduces to entanglement with environment. Irreversibility is thermodynamic (entropy increase), not fundamental. This supports B-theory—all times exist; we just can't access coherent superpositions at macroscopic scales.

**Time-symmetric interpretations**: [[retrocausality|Retrocausal]] frameworks (transactional interpretation, TSVF) describe quantum events as transactions between past and future boundary conditions. This challenges both presentism (future must exist to send backward-propagating waves) and simple eternalism (the transaction "completes" in some sense).

## The Site's Position

The site's [[time-collapse-and-agency|temporal framework]] proposes:

1. **Collapse is real** (not merely decoherence)—the [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]] tenet requires this
2. **Collapse introduces time's arrow**—irreversibility emerges through measurement, not just entropy
3. **Consciousness participates in collapse**—the [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet
4. **This participation may be atemporal**—[[retrocausality|retrocausal]] constraints across time, not causes at moments

This suggests a **modified growing block**: the block grows through consciousness-involving collapse. The present is where superpositions resolve; the past is the accumulated collapsed structure; the future doesn't yet exist (is superposed possibility awaiting selection).

But "growth" isn't a process in time—it's the constitution of time. Consciousness doesn't act *in* time to collapse superpositions; consciousness's collapse-participation *creates* temporal structure. The flow we experience is what this constitution feels like from within.

This dissolves apparent conflicts:
- **Retrocausality vs. irreversibility**: Retrocausality operates within the time-symmetric physics before collapse establishes direction. After collapse, the selected history is simply the history.
- **A-theory vs. B-theory**: The framework is A-theoretic (real temporal becoming through collapse) but explains why B-theoretic description works for established past (the block, once grown, is there to describe tenselessly).
- **Presentism's truth-maker problem**: The past exists (like growing block), so past-tense statements have truth-makers.

## Temporal Phenomenology

Whatever the correct metaphysics, temporal *experience* has distinctive features:

**The specious present**: [[temporal-consciousness|Experienced time]] has duration—roughly 100-750ms. We don't experience durationless instants but extended "now" within which succession is unified (James, Husserl).

**The sense of flow**: Time seems to pass. The present feels special—vivid, here, now. Past and future feel different in kind.

**Asymmetric access**: We remember the past, not the future. We can affect the future, not the past (or so it seems).

**[[duration|Durée]]**: Bergson's "lived time" is qualitative, interpenetrating—not a sequence of instants but continuous creative advance. Clock time abstracts from this.

These phenomenological features don't decisively settle metaphysics (B-theorists explain them as illusions or indexical effects), but they constrain adequate theories. A metaphysics that dismisses temporal phenomenology as mere confusion must explain why the confusion is so systematic and universal.

The site's framework predicts temporal phenomenology: if consciousness constitutes temporal structure through collapse, the specious present is the phenomenology of this constitutive activity. We experience duration because we create duration. Flow isn't illusion; it's what time-constitution feels like.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Philosophy of time connects to all five tenets:

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]**: If consciousness constitutes temporal structure, it's not reducible to physical processes occurring within time. The reduction would be circular—you can't explain time-constitution in terms of processes that presuppose time.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]**: Collapse is the minimal intervention point. Consciousness doesn't inject energy or override deterministic law; it resolves quantum indeterminacy where physics leaves outcomes open.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]**: Consciousness selects collapse outcomes, affecting physical states. Retrocausality means "bidirectional" includes temporal direction—consciousness affects past preparation as well as future measurement.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]**: The framework requires real collapse. MWI denies collapse; all branches exist. Without real collapse, no selection, no irreversibility, no consciousness-constituted time.

**[[tenets#^occam|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]**: The metaphysics is complex. But temporal experience is complex. Simpler metaphysics (pure B-theory eternalism, eliminativism about flow) achieve parsimony by denying phenomena rather than explaining them.
