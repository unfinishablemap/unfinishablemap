Baseline cognition is what neural systems achieve without substantial conscious contribution—sophisticated information processing that operates within the constraints of modular, domain-specific mechanisms. Great apes exemplify baseline cognition: tool use, social reasoning, emotional complexity, procedural metacognition, and cultural traditions—all without the metarepresentational capacities that distinguish human intelligence. If consciousness were removed from humans, the remaining cognitive architecture might resemble great ape cognition—powerful but bounded.

The term "consciousness" here means primarily *phenomenal consciousness*—the subjective, qualitative character of experience, what philosophers call "something it is like" to be in a mental state. The claim is not merely that great apes lack certain information-processing capacities (access consciousness) but that the qualitative dimension of human experience enables cognitive operations that great apes cannot perform. This distinction matters: functionalist accounts might grant apes sophisticated access consciousness while denying the phenomenal amplification this article describes.

The Unfinishable Map proposes that consciousness doesn't add computational power (neurons handle computation) but *amplifies* baseline cognition through flexible deployment, metacognitive monitoring, and counterfactual reasoning. This article characterises the starting point; [[consciousness-as-amplifier|Consciousness as Intelligence Amplifier]] details how consciousness transforms it. Understanding what baseline cognition can and cannot achieve clarifies what consciousness contributes—and provides evidence against [[epiphenomenalism]], since the human-ape gap tracks precisely those capacities where consciousness appears causally required.

## What Baseline Cognition Achieves

Great apes demonstrate remarkably sophisticated cognition without the consciousness-dependent capacities humans possess:

### Domain-Specific Excellence

Chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas show:

- **Tool use**: Stick fishing for termites, nut-cracking with anvil stones, leaf sponges for water. These behaviours are culturally transmitted—different groups have different traditions.
- **Social reasoning**: Tracking relationships, forming coalitions, understanding dominance hierarchies, anticipating others' responses based on their goals and knowledge states.
- **Emotional complexity**: Grief responses, consolation behaviours, apparent empathy, play, and individual personality differences.
- **Problem-solving**: Insight-like behaviour in novel situations, means-ends reasoning, basic planning for immediate goals.

This isn't "mere" instinct. Great ape cognition is flexible, learned, and varies between individuals and populations. Völter et al. (2023) confirmed that great ape cognition consists of stable, measurable traits that develop in response to experience—a coherent cognitive architecture, not reflexive responding.

### Procedural Metacognition

Great apes monitor their own cognitive states—they seek information when uncertain, avoid tasks they're likely to fail, and show confidence calibrated to their performance. This is [[metacognition]], but of a specific kind: *procedural* metacognition, consisting of feelings that guide behaviour without explicit representation.

A chimpanzee might *feel* uncertain and look for more information, but (the hypothesis proposes) cannot represent that uncertainty *as* uncertainty—cannot think "I don't know whether the food is in the left or right container." The feeling functions adaptively without being an object of thought.

### The Zone of Latent Solutions (Novel Combinations)

Tomasello (2010) characterises ape innovation as occurring within the "zone of latent solutions"—the space of behaviours achievable by recombining existing cognitive resources. Apes can discover uses for tools their species hasn't discovered before, but only if those uses are accessible through trial-and-error exploration without requiring insight that transcends current representations.

Human innovation differs: we generate genuinely novel solutions by explicitly representing problems, considering multiple approaches, and systematically modifying existing methods. This requires metarepresentation—taking our existing solutions as objects of thought to evaluate and improve.

This corresponds to the second consciousness-requiring function: *novel combinations of operations*. [[conscious-vs-unconscious-processing|Research on global workspace]] shows that conscious access enables information to be broadcast across distant brain regions, allowing multiple specialized processors to be chained in novel sequences. Great apes' restriction to the zone of latent solutions reflects their inability to flexibly recombine learned procedures—precisely what happens when information remains local to individual modules without the global broadcast that consciousness provides.

## What Baseline Cognition Cannot Achieve

The human-ape intelligence gap isn't random. Great apes show systematic limitations in capacities tied to conscious processing.

A 2025 meta-analysis (Randeniya) dramatically revised the scope of unconscious processing: only 10% of claimed unconscious effects survive rigorous methodological scrutiny. This matters because the "baseline cognition" hypothesis predicts exactly this pattern—if baseline cognition represents what neural processing achieves without consciousness, we should expect genuinely unconscious processing to be far more limited than previously assumed. The [[conscious-vs-unconscious-processing]] evidence converges with comparative cognition: both approaches reveal consciousness is functionally necessary for specific operations.

[[conscious-vs-unconscious-processing|Global Workspace Theory research]] identifies three functions specifically requiring conscious access: *durable information maintenance*, *novel combinations of operations*, and *spontaneous intentional action*. These three functions map precisely onto the great ape limitations below:

### Working Memory Capacity (Durable Maintenance)

Chimpanzee working memory holds approximately 2±1 items compared to human 7±2 (Miller's limit). This three-to-four-fold expansion enables qualitatively different cognitive operations. With 2 items, you can compare A to B. With 7 items, you can hold A, B, C, D while tracking their relationships, considering E and F as alternatives, and keeping the goal G in mind.

If [[working-memory]] depends on conscious access (as [[global-workspace-theory|Global Workspace Theory]] proposes), the capacity expansion implies expanded consciousness. The additional slots aren't just storage—they're workspace for manipulation, comparison, and flexible combination.

This connects to the first consciousness-requiring function identified in [[conscious-vs-unconscious-processing]]: *durable information maintenance*. Subliminal priming effects decay within 500ms; consciously perceived information can be maintained for seconds to minutes. Great apes' limited working memory capacity reflects limited conscious maintenance—information fades rapidly, preventing the extended manipulation that human cognition requires.

### Declarative Metacognition

The distinction between procedural and declarative metacognition is crucial:

| Type | Description | Great Apes | Humans |
|------|-------------|------------|--------|
| **Procedural** | Feelings guiding behaviour | Yes | Yes |
| **Declarative** | Explicit knowledge of mental states | Limited/Absent | Yes |

Procedural metacognition: "I feel uncertain" → seek more information.
Declarative metacognition: "I *know* that I don't know" → represents the knowledge state itself.

This distinction parallels the [[working-memory#The Maintenance/Manipulation Distinction|maintenance/manipulation distinction]] in working memory research. Maintaining information can proceed unconsciously (activity-silent short-term memory). But *manipulating* information—using it flexibly—requires conscious reactivation. Declarative metacognition is manipulation of mental states: taking your beliefs as objects of thought to evaluate, modify, and discuss.

### The Jourdain Hypothesis

Whiten (2015) proposes that "apes have culture but may not know that they do"—the Jourdain Hypothesis, named after Molière's character who discovers he's been speaking prose all his life without knowing it.

Great apes express cultural traditions—different groups have different tool-use techniques, grooming patterns, vocalisations—but don't represent these as "our way of doing things" subject to deliberate modification and transmission. They behave culturally without culturally representing their behaviour.

[[cumulative-culture|Cumulative culture]]—the "ratchet effect" where innovations build on innovations without backward slippage—requires metarepresentation. You must represent the current method as a method, see how it could be improved, and transmit the improvement so others can build further. Without this metarepresentational capacity, culture stays within the zone of latent solutions: traditions persist but don't systematically accumulate.

### Logical Reasoning

Empirical research (Lieberman et al. 2008) demonstrates that rule-based logical reasoning specifically requires conscious processing:

- Cognitive load disrupting conscious attention impairs logical reasoning
- Disrupting unconscious processes does not impair logical reasoning
- Unconscious priming of logical concepts fails to improve reasoning

Unconscious processing excels at pattern recognition and associative learning. But explicit rule-following—"if P then Q, P, therefore Q"—requires conscious manipulation of representations. If great apes lack the conscious capacity for rule-following, their reasoning would be fundamentally associative rather than logical.

### Counterfactual Thinking (Spontaneous Intentional Action)

Humans uniquely imagine situations that don't exist—learning from hypothetical alternatives, planning for future need-states not currently experienced, evaluating actions by their possible consequences. [[counterfactual-reasoning|Counterfactual reasoning]] requires explicitly representing non-actual states while manipulating those representations to draw conclusions—a capacity demanding the kind of integrated workspace that Global Workspace Theory associates with consciousness.

The Bischof-Köhler hypothesis proposes that animals cannot act on drive states they don't currently possess: a sated animal won't store food for future hunger because it cannot consciously represent that future need-state. Evidence for great ape foresight exists but remains limited—they may anticipate immediate futures but show little capacity for the extended mental simulation that characterises human planning.

This connects to the third consciousness-requiring function: *spontaneous intentional action*—generating goal-directed behaviour from internal states rather than external triggers. [[conscious-vs-unconscious-processing#Blindsight: The Paradigm Case|Blindsight patients]] cannot spontaneously use blind-field information to initiate self-directed action. Great apes show similar limitations—sophisticated reactive cognition without the self-initiated goal pursuit that requires maintaining future states while selecting appropriate actions.

### Social Cognition: Where the Gap Is Clearest

[[consciousness-and-social-cognition|Social cognition]] provides the clearest domain where the baseline/conscious distinction manifests. Theory of mind admits of levels, and the level structure tracks the procedural/declarative distinction precisely:

- **Levels 0-1** (behaviour prediction, perception attribution): Operate within baseline cognition. Chimpanzees track what others have seen, anticipate behaviour based on goals, and adjust strategy accordingly—all without representing mental states *as* mental states.

- **Level 2** (belief attribution): Contested territory. Some evidence suggests great apes understand false beliefs in competitive contexts; other evidence finds only behaviour-tracking. The ambiguity reflects the boundary between baseline and conscious cognition.

- **Level 3** (recursive mindreading): Clearly requires consciousness. "She thinks that I think the food is hidden" demands holding multiple nested representations simultaneously while manipulating them—precisely what baseline cognition cannot achieve.

Shared intentionality provides another marker. Joint attention isn't merely two agents attending the same object—it involves recursive mutual awareness: I know you're attending, you know I'm attending, I know you know, and so on. This "common knowledge" structure requires the phenomenal binding that conscious integration provides. Great apes show limited evidence of joint attention in this rich sense; they track attention without sharing it.

The empathy hierarchy shows similar stratification:

| Component | Consciousness Required? | Present in Apes? |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------|
| Emotional contagion | No—automatic | Yes |
| Cognitive empathy | Minimal—representing states | Possibly |
| Empathic concern | Yes—caring *because* you understand | Limited/Absent |

Empathic concern—feeling *for* another because you understand their situation—involves metarepresentation of their emotional state and a felt motivational response. The phenomenal character of concern appears irreducible: you must feel something to care in the way genuine empathy involves. This explains why great apes show consolation behaviour (emotional contagion plus approach) without the systematic helping motivated by understanding that characterises human empathy.

Social cognition thus exemplifies the general pattern: baseline cognition handles sophisticated social tasks through implicit processing, but the metarepresentational operations underlying recursive mindreading, shared intentionality, and empathic concern require conscious amplification.

## The Epiphenomenalism Challenge

If consciousness were [[epiphenomenalism|epiphenomenal]]—causally inert, merely observing neural processing—the systematic correspondence between consciousness-requiring capacities and the human-ape gap would be coincidental. Why would causally inert consciousness track exactly those capacities that distinguish human from great ape cognition?

The baseline cognition framework supports the [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet. The pattern predicts:

1. Capacities achievable through unconscious processing should appear in great apes
2. Capacities requiring conscious processing should be absent or severely limited
3. The gap should track consciousness-dependent operations specifically

This is what we observe. Great apes excel within baseline cognition and fail systematically where consciousness appears required. The simplest explanation: consciousness does the amplifying work.

## The Illusionist Challenge

[[illusionism|Illusionists]] might argue that "consciousness-dependent" capacities are really unconscious processes generating the *illusion* of conscious contribution. We experience ourselves as reasoning consciously, but the work happens below awareness.

Several considerations resist this move:

**The empirical evidence**: The Lieberman study provides suggestive evidence, though one study rarely settles fundamental questions. The finding that cognitive load impairs logical reasoning while unconscious disruption does not suggests dissociation—but the interpretation depends on whether "logical reasoning" and "consciousness" are being measured independently of each other. Additional studies (notably De Neys, 2012, on dual-process theory) support the general pattern: explicit rule-following differs from implicit pattern recognition in ways that track conscious accessibility.

**The systematic pattern**: If consciousness is epiphenomenal, why does the human-ape gap track consciousness-dependent capacities so precisely? The correlation requires explanation.

**The training effects**: Metacognitive training (meditation, contemplative practice) improves cognitive performance. If consciousness were illusory, what is being trained? The training effect requires explanation in terms that don't invoke consciousness—and such explanations remain elusive.

**The regress problem**: Explaining the *appearance* of conscious contribution requires phenomenal vocabulary. The experience of effortful reasoning, the feeling of insight, the sense of deliberate manipulation—if these are illusions, something generates them. An illusionist might respond that the "generator" is simply brain processes producing introspective representations. But the question resurfaces: what makes these representations feel like anything? The illusionist must either deny that they feel like anything (eliminativism) or explain the phenomenal character of introspection—which reinstates the original problem at a higher level.

## Great Ape Phenomenal Consciousness

The baseline cognition hypothesis doesn't deny great ape consciousness. Great apes likely have genuine phenomenal experience: emotional consciousness, perceptual consciousness, basic social consciousness. The proposal is that human and great ape consciousness differ *qualitatively*—not merely in complexity but in kind.

Great apes may possess access consciousness (information available for behaviour) without the full reflexive consciousness humans possess (consciousness that can take itself as object). They experience without necessarily experiencing that they experience—a distinction central to [[introspection|introspective]] capacity and the limits thereof.

This connects to [[minimal-consciousness|minimal consciousness]] research. Consciousness may admit of degrees and kinds. The question isn't "conscious or not?" but "what kind of consciousness, supporting what cognitive operations?"

## Implications for AI

The baseline cognition framework has implications for [[ai-consciousness|artificial intelligence]]. Current AI systems excel at pattern recognition, statistical correlation, and domain-specific performance—precisely the capacities baseline cognition handles.

What AI struggles with—genuine flexibility across domains, metacognitive monitoring that improves with feedback, counterfactual reasoning about unprecedented situations, cumulative improvement through deliberate innovation—are the capacities tied to consciousness in the human-ape comparison.

This doesn't prove AI cannot be conscious. It suggests that if AI achieves human-level cognition, it would require something functionally equivalent to conscious amplification—whatever the substrate.

## Implications for Free Will

If consciousness enables counterfactual reasoning and deliberate selection among alternatives—choosing this action after considering others—then the baseline cognition framework supports [[free-will|libertarian free will]]. Great apes act; humans deliberate about their actions. The capacity to represent multiple possible futures and select among them is precisely what libertarian accounts of free will describe.

This connection runs deeper than analogy. The [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet proposes that consciousness selects among superposed neural states. If correct, conscious deliberation is not merely accompanied by neural activity but *intervenes* in it—the mind genuinely choosing which of several possible actions becomes actual. The baseline-to-human transition marks not just expanded cognition but the emergence of genuine agency.

## Contemplative Perspectives

Buddhist psychology distinguishes consciousness (*vijñāna*) from the mental factors (*cetasika*) that accompany it. Consciousness provides awareness; mental factors provide content and cognitive operations. This framework parallels baseline cognition: neural processes provide cognitive operations; consciousness enables rather than performs them.

The Abhidharma analysis identifies mental factors that cannot operate without consciousness as their support. *Vitakka* (applied thought) and *vicāra* (sustained thought) enable deliberate cognitive manipulation—but they require *vijñāna* to function. This maps onto the amplification thesis: certain cognitive operations inherently require conscious support.

Process philosophy offers a complementary framework. Alfred North Whitehead proposes that complex organisms exhibit "high-grade occasions"—unified experiences integrating diverse inputs into coherent wholes. The baseline-to-human transition might involve the emergence of increasingly high-grade occasions capable of greater integration, enabling the binding and manipulation that metarepresentation requires.

## What Would Challenge This View?

The baseline cognition hypothesis could be undermined by:

1. **Great apes achieving human-level cognition**: If training enabled cumulative culture, logical reasoning, or counterfactual thinking without consciousness expansion, the correlation would fail.

2. **Working memory expansion without cognitive gains**: If pharmaceutical enhancement of great ape WM to 7±2 items produced no corresponding metarepresentation or logical reasoning improvement, the link would weaken.

3. **Unconscious logical reasoning**: If experiments demonstrated rule-based reasoning under conditions eliminating conscious access, the specific linkage would fail.

4. **AI achieving human-level cognition without consciousness**: If artificial systems replicated flexibility, metacognition, and cumulative improvement while being demonstrably non-conscious, consciousness would be unnecessary for these capacities.

5. **Random human-ape gap**: If the gap were distributed randomly across capacities—some consciousness-dependent, some not—rather than systematically tracking consciousness, the pattern would be coincidental.

## Relation to Site Perspective

**Dualism**: If consciousness genuinely amplifies baseline cognition—contributing something neural processing alone cannot achieve—then consciousness has causal powers not derivable from physics. The systematic correspondence between consciousness-requiring capacities and the human-ape gap suggests consciousness adds something irreducible.

**Bidirectional Interaction**: The baseline cognition framework specifies *how* consciousness causally contributes: through flexible deployment, metacognitive monitoring, metarepresentation, and counterfactual simulation. These aren't vague "influences" but identifiable mechanisms.

**Minimal Quantum Interaction**: If consciousness interfaces with neural states through quantum selection, the amplification might operate at that level—biasing which neural patterns become actual when multiple possibilities exist. But the framework doesn't require quantum mechanisms; classical attention-based selection could produce similar effects.

**No Many Worlds**: Logical reasoning, counterfactual thinking, and metarepresentation all require determinate outcomes. Many-worlds theorists handle decision-making through self-locating uncertainty and decision-theoretic weighting, but these accounts struggle with the phenomenology of settling—the experience of reaching *this* conclusion rather than merely existing in a branch where "reaching this conclusion" happened. The baseline cognition framework assumes consciousness genuinely selects among possibilities rather than merely observing branch-relative outcomes.

**Occam's Razor Has Limits**: The simplest hypothesis—great apes lack human intelligence due to neural complexity alone, consciousness is epiphenomenal—fails the evidence. The systematic pattern, the empirical dissociations, the training effects all suggest consciousness causally contributes. Sometimes the parsimonious explanation is wrong.
