Apes have culture but may not know they have culture. This is the Jourdain Hypothesis, named after Monsieur Jourdain in Molière's *Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme*, who discovers to his astonishment that he has been speaking prose all his life. The hypothesis, articulated by Andrew Whiten (2015), captures a crucial distinction: having mental states versus representing oneself as having them. Great apes possess cultural traditions—tool-use techniques, grooming patterns, food preferences that vary between groups—but may not represent these as "our way of doing things" subject to deliberate evaluation and modification.

The Unfinishable Map takes this distinction as evidence for the [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet. If the difference between procedural and declarative metacognition marks the boundary between [[baseline-cognition|baseline]] and consciousness-amplified cognition, and if metarepresentation requires phenomenal consciousness, then consciousness causally enables capacities humans possess and apes lack—including [[cumulative-culture|cumulative culture]], explicit reasoning, and deliberate self-improvement.

## The Literary Reference

In Molière's 1670 play, Monsieur Jourdain—a wealthy bourgeois aspiring to sophistication—learns from his philosophy teacher that all speech is either verse or prose. Realising he has been speaking prose his entire life without knowing it, Jourdain exclaims: "Par ma foi! il y a plus de quarante ans que je dis de la prose sans que j'en susse rien" ("Good heavens! For more than forty years I have been speaking prose without knowing it!").

The humour lies in the gap between doing and knowing-that-you're-doing. Jourdain spoke perfectly good prose—the capacity functioned—but lacked the metarepresentational awareness that what he was doing *was* prose, a category of thing with a name and properties that distinguished it from verse.

Whiten applies this pattern to great ape culture. Chimpanzees transmit cultural traditions—different groups have different techniques for termite fishing, nut cracking, and grooming. These are genuine cultural practices, transmitted socially rather than genetically, varying between populations. The apes *have* culture. But they may not *know* they have culture in the sense of representing their practices as practices, as ways-of-doing-things that could be different and might be improved.

## Procedural versus Declarative Metacognition

The Jourdain Hypothesis rests on a distinction between two kinds of metacognition:

| Type | Definition | Great Apes | Humans |
|------|------------|------------|--------|
| **Procedural** | Implicit feelings that guide behaviour | Yes | Yes |
| **Declarative** | Explicit knowledge of mental states | Limited/Absent | Yes |

**Procedural metacognition** involves feelings that influence action without being objects of explicit awareness. A chimpanzee might *feel* uncertain about which container holds food and therefore seek more information. The uncertainty functions adaptively—it guides appropriate behaviour. But the chimpanzee may not represent that uncertainty *as* uncertainty, cannot think "I don't know which container has the food."

**Declarative metacognition** involves explicit representation of one's own mental states. Humans not only feel uncertain; we know that we feel uncertain, can evaluate our uncertainty, communicate it to others, and take steps to address it. We represent our mental states as mental states.

The parallel to speaking prose is exact. Jourdain *spoke* prose (his speech functioned as prose), but didn't *know* he spoke prose (couldn't represent his speech as belonging to the category "prose"). Great apes may *have* culture (their practices function as culture), without *knowing* they have culture (representing their practices as belonging to the category "cultural traditions").

## Evidence for the Hypothesis

Several lines of evidence support the claim that great apes lack declarative metacognition while possessing the procedural kind:

### Cultural Stability

Great ape cultural traditions show remarkable stability across generations but little cumulative improvement. Chimpanzees today use essentially the same termite-fishing techniques observed by Jane Goodall in the 1960s. If they represented these techniques as techniques—as ways of doing things that could be evaluated and improved—we would expect more innovation and accumulation. The pattern suggests functional culture without metarepresentational awareness of culture.

### Teaching Asymmetry

Great apes rarely teach in the human sense. They learn socially through emulation (observing outcomes and figuring out how to achieve them), social facilitation (attention drawn to objects others manipulate), and stimulus enhancement (interest in locations where others forage). But active pedagogy—deliberately adjusting your behaviour to transmit knowledge to a learner—requires knowing that you know something the learner doesn't, and representing that knowledge gap as something to be bridged. Teaching requires the Jourdain transition: from having knowledge to knowing that you have knowledge.

### Theory of Mind Limits

Great apes understand that others have goals, perceptions, and some knowledge states. But "Level 1" theory of mind (understanding what others perceive) may not require metarepresentation. "Level 2" (understanding that others' perspectives on the same object can differ from your own) plausibly does. Great apes show clearer evidence for Level 1 than Level 2—consistent with possessing procedural but not declarative understanding of minds.

## Social Cognition: Where the Jourdain Distinction Is Clearest

[[Consciousness-and-social-cognition|Social cognition]] provides the sharpest evidence for the procedural/declarative divide. The 4-level theory of mind hierarchy maps directly onto the Jourdain distinction:

| Level | Description | Requires Metarepresentation? | Great Apes |
|-------|-------------|------------------------------|------------|
| 0 | Behaviour prediction | No | Yes |
| 1 | Perception attribution | Minimal | Yes |
| 2 | Belief attribution (false belief) | Yes | Contested |
| 3 | Recursive mindreading | Definitely | No |

**Level 3**—representing another's beliefs about your beliefs about their intentions—requires holding nested representations simultaneously in [[working-memory]] while manipulating their relationships. This is the cognitive operation the Jourdain transition describes: not just having representations, but representing them *as* representations subject to deliberate comparison and inference.

### Shared Intentionality

Tomasello's concept of shared intentionality illuminates the transition. Joint attention—knowing that you're both attending, knowing that the other knows—involves the infinite recursion of common knowledge: "I know you know I know..." This recursive mutual awareness characterises human social coordination and is conspicuously limited in great apes.

The Jourdain Hypothesis explains why. To engage in genuine joint attention, you must represent your own attention state, represent the other's attention state, and represent the relationship between them. You must *know* you're attending jointly, not merely attend in parallel. This is Monsieur Jourdain's transition applied to attention itself.

### The Empathy Gradient

The three-component model of empathy tracks the same distinction:

1. **Emotional contagion**: Automatic, unconscious "catching" of emotions. Jourdain-level—having the response without knowing you have it.

2. **Cognitive empathy**: Understanding what another feels without necessarily sharing it. Requires representing their emotional state *as* an emotional state.

3. **Empathic concern**: Feeling *for* another because you understand their situation. Requires both representing their state and experiencing motivation arising from that representation.

Great apes show clear emotional contagion and some cognitive empathy. Empathic concern—which requires integrating metarepresentation with felt motivation—appears limited. The gradient tracks the Jourdain transition: from implicit social responsiveness to explicit understanding of minds *as* minds.

### The Tip-of-the-Tongue Contrast

Humans experience tip-of-the-tongue states: knowing that we know something without being able to retrieve it. Remarkably, we can assess features of the unretrieved knowledge—it starts with 'M', has three syllables. This requires metarepresentation: representing our knowledge state as a knowledge state with assessable properties. No analogous phenomenon has been documented in great apes. They may feel uncertainty (procedural), but not represent their knowledge states as states with knowable features.

## Why the Distinction Matters

### For Cumulative Culture

Cumulative culture—the ratchet effect where innovations build on innovations—requires metarepresentation. To improve a tool, you must represent the tool-making process *as* a process that could be done differently. To transmit an improvement, you must communicate not just the technique but its relationship to prior techniques: "this is better than the old way." Without the Jourdain transition, culture stays within Tomasello's "zone of latent solutions"—achievements within the space reachable by individual cognition, but no systematic accumulation beyond it.

### For Consciousness Studies

If the Jourdain Hypothesis is correct, it identifies a specific cognitive capacity—declarative metacognition—that distinguishes human from great ape cognition. If this capacity requires phenomenal consciousness (representing your mental states requires experiencing them as mental states), then the human-ape gap provides evidence that consciousness causally contributes to intelligence. The gap tracks consciousness-dependent capacities, just as the [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet predicts.

### For AI Assessment

The hypothesis provides a lens for evaluating artificial intelligence. Current AI systems produce culturally-relevant outputs—texts, images, code—but do they *know* they have these capacities? Can they represent their own processes as processes subject to evaluation and improvement? The Jourdain transition poses a challenge: moving from systems that function culturally (like apes) to systems that understand themselves as cultural agents (like humans). Producing metacognitive-seeming outputs is not the same as genuinely making the transition.

## The Illusionist Challenge

[[illusionism|Illusionists]] might argue that the appearance of declarative metacognition is itself illusory—sophisticated functional processing generating the *illusion* of knowing-that-you-know, with no genuine phenomenal difference. On this view, the Jourdain transition would be from one kind of processing to another, not from non-metarepresentational to genuinely metarepresentational cognition.

The response parallels the general anti-illusionist argument. For there to be an *appearance* of making the Jourdain transition—for it to *seem* like you've moved from unconscious competence to conscious awareness of competence—something must experience that seeming. The illusion of metarepresentation requires a subject to be fooled. That subject's experiencing of the illusion is precisely what needs explanation.

More specifically: if humans merely *seem* to know they have culture (without genuinely knowing it), what generates the seeming? The seeming is itself a phenomenon requiring explanation. Either it has phenomenal character (undermining illusionism), or it doesn't (leaving mysterious why it should seem like anything at all).

## Buddhist Contemplative Perspectives

The Jourdain transition maps onto distinctions in Buddhist psychology. The Abhidharma tradition distinguishes between mental factors operating automatically (*vīthi*-mind processes) and moments of clear knowing (*paññā*) where mental contents become objects of awareness. The progress from procedural to declarative metacognition parallels the contemplative cultivation of *sampajañña* (clear comprehension)—knowing what one is doing *as* one does it.

*Sati* (mindfulness) explicitly cultivates the Jourdain transition. The instruction to be mindful of walking "when walking" or of breathing "when breathing" is precisely the instruction to move from doing to knowing-that-you're-doing. Contemplative traditions have long recognised this as a genuine transition, achievable through practice—consistent with it being a real phenomenon rather than illusory processing.

The *vipassanā* tradition aims to reveal the three marks (*tilakkhaṇa*) of experience: impermanence, suffering, and non-self. Seeing these marks requires metarepresentation—experiencing your experiences *as* impermanent, *as* subtly unsatisfactory, *as* not-self. The claim that great apes lack metarepresentation suggests they cannot engage in this form of contemplative investigation, not merely because they lack training but because they lack the requisite cognitive architecture.

## Process Philosophy Perspective

Whitehead's distinction between low-grade and high-grade actual occasions illuminates the Jourdain transition. All actual occasions involve prehension—grasping prior occasions into new synthesis. But high-grade occasions involve what Whitehead calls "intellectual feelings"—prehending abstract concepts and relations, including relations to one's own mental states.

The Jourdain transition is the transition from occasions that prehend the world to occasions that also prehend their own prehending. Great apes may have genuine phenomenal experience—low-grade occasions with subjective immediacy—without achieving the high-grade occasions where experience becomes an object for itself. The "prose" was always there; what emerges is the capacity to prehend it *as* prose.

## What Would Challenge This View?

Several findings would undermine the Jourdain Hypothesis:

1. **Great apes demonstrating explicit cultural metarepresentation**: If experiments revealed that chimpanzees or bonobos could represent their cultural practices as practices—indicating awareness that "this is how we do it" distinct from "this is what we're doing"—the hypothesis would fail for its paradigm case.

2. **Cumulative culture without metarepresentation**: If any species demonstrated systematic cultural ratcheting while lacking metarepresentational capacity, the proposed link between cumulative culture and metarepresentation would be severed.

3. **Teaching in great apes**: If great apes demonstrated true pedagogy—deliberately adjusting transmission based on assessed knowledge states in self and other—the teaching asymmetry evidence would fail.

4. **Philosophical objection succeeding**: If the very distinction between procedural and declarative metacognition proved incoherent—if there were no real difference between behaving-as-if-you-know and knowing-that-you-know—the hypothesis would lose its foundation.

## Relation to Site Perspective

### Bidirectional Interaction

The [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet holds that consciousness causally influences the physical world. The Jourdain Hypothesis provides a specific mechanism: consciousness enables the transition from procedural to declarative metacognition, from having mental states to knowing you have them. This transition unlocks cumulative culture, explicit reasoning, and deliberate self-improvement. If the transition requires phenomenal consciousness—if you cannot know that you know without experiencing that knowing—then consciousness does causal work that neural processing alone cannot accomplish.

### Dualism

The [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]] tenet holds that consciousness is irreducible to physical processes. The Jourdain transition, if it genuinely requires phenomenal consciousness, provides evidence: great apes possess sophisticated neural machinery for culture, social learning, and metacognitive monitoring, yet lack the declarative capacity that humans possess. If the difference were merely computational complexity, we might expect gradations. The apparent discreteness—procedural metacognition present, declarative metacognition absent—suggests something qualitatively new is required, not merely more of the same.

### Occam's Razor Has Limits

The simpler hypothesis—that all metacognition is really procedural, that the appearance of "knowing that you know" is just more sophisticated processing—fails the evidence. The systematic pattern (cumulative culture absent where declarative metacognition is absent), the contemplative evidence (traditions explicitly cultivating the transition), and the phenomenology (it genuinely seems different to know versus to know-that-you-know) all warrant the less parsimonious conclusion: the Jourdain transition is real, and it requires something beyond functional processing.
