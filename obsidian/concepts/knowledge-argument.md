The knowledge argument, formulated by Frank Jackson (1982, 1986), is one of the most influential arguments against [[materialism|physicalism]]. It uses a thought experiment—Mary's Room—to show that complete physical knowledge doesn't constitute complete knowledge. Mary, a brilliant scientist who knows every physical fact about color vision, learns something new when she first sees color. What she learns is *what it's like* to see red—a fact that physical knowledge alone could not provide. Therefore, non-physical facts exist, and physicalism is false.

This argument directly supports the [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]] tenet and connects to the [[explanatory-gap]] literature. It remains actively debated despite its creator's later rejection—a testament to its philosophical force.

## Mary's Room

Mary is a brilliant neuroscientist who has spent her entire life in a black-and-white room. From within this room, she has somehow learned everything physical there is to know about color vision: which wavelengths stimulate which cone cells, how neural signals propagate from retina to cortex, what brain states correlate with color reports, and every other physical fact relevant to seeing colors.

One day, Mary leaves her room and sees a red rose for the first time.

Does she learn something new?

Intuitively, yes. Before leaving, Mary knew what happens in brains when people see red. After leaving, she knows *what it's like* to see red. These seem different. The first is third-person, objective, expressible in equations and diagrams. The second is first-person, subjective, and captures something that no physical description could convey.

But Mary already knew all the physical facts. So if she learns something new, there must be facts beyond the physical facts. If there are facts beyond physical facts, physicalism is false—consciousness is not reducible to physical processes.

## The Argument's Structure

Jackson's argument can be formalized:

1. Mary knows all physical facts about color vision before leaving her room
2. Mary learns something new upon seeing color for the first time
3. Therefore, what Mary learns was not included in the physical facts
4. Therefore, not all facts are physical facts
5. Therefore, physicalism is false

The strength lies in premise 2—the "learning claim." Surveys consistently show that most people share the intuition that Mary learns something new. The intuition has powerful psychological grip across diverse populations.

## Physicalist Responses

The argument has generated sophisticated responses, none of which commands consensus.

### The Ability Hypothesis

David Lewis and Laurence Nemirow argue that Mary gains only practical abilities, not propositional knowledge. Upon seeing red, she acquires the ability to imagine, recognize, and remember the experience. These are skills—know-how rather than know-that—and don't require non-physical facts.

The response preserves physicalism: abilities are dispositions of physical systems, not evidence of non-physical reality.

But critics identify fatal problems. Abilities are neither necessary nor sufficient for phenomenal knowledge. Someone without visual imagination could still know what red looks like. And someone could have the imaginative abilities without having had the experience—perhaps through brain stimulation—yet arguably wouldn't have the same knowledge Mary gains. The ability hypothesis fails to capture what makes Mary's learning significant.

### The Phenomenal Concepts Strategy

Brian Loar, David Papineau, and others argue that Mary gains new *concepts*, not new facts. The facts were physical all along; what changes is her mode of access to them. Just as learning that water is H₂O doesn't reveal new stuff (water and H₂O were always the same), Mary gains a new way of representing the same physical facts.

This preserves physicalism by locating the gap in our concepts rather than reality. The same fact can be grasped under physical concepts ("C-fiber activation") or phenomenal concepts ("this reddish feeling").

But David Chalmers raises a dilemma—the "master argument" against phenomenal concepts strategy discussed in [[phenomenal-concepts-strategy]]. Either phenomenal concepts are themselves physical (in which case [[philosophical-zombies|zombies]] could have them, contradicting the strategy's claim that experience is needed to acquire them) or they involve something non-physical (conceding dualism). The strategy faces internal tensions that prevent it from satisfying both physicalist requirements and explaining Mary's situation.

### Denying Mary's Knowledge

Daniel Dennett argues that if Mary truly knew all physical facts, she could predict what seeing red would be like. The intuition that she couldn't stems from underestimating what "all physical facts" really means. A complete physical description would include facts about how the brain represents and responds to color—enough to anticipate the experience.

This amounts to denying premise 1: Mary's confinement prevents her from acquiring certain physical knowledge, not just phenomenal knowledge. She can't fully understand brain states she's never had.

But this seems to miss the point. Even if Mary could predict her behavioral responses to red, would she know *what it's like* before seeing it? The qualitative character of the experience seems to require undergoing it, not merely predicting it.

### The Illusionist Response

[[illusionism|Illusionists]] offer the most radical dismissal: Mary learns nothing substantive because there are no phenomenal facts to learn. What she gains upon leaving is simply a new representational state—a new way her brain models its own processing—not access to some non-physical property. The "learning" intuition reflects our mistaken belief that experience has intrinsic qualitative properties when it doesn't.

This response faces the same regress that afflicts illusionism generally. If Mary *seems* to learn something—if there is something it is like for her to have the new experience—then that seeming itself is phenomenal. The illusionist must explain why Mary reports learning something new, and this explanation cannot invoke the very phenomenal properties being denied. As Raymond Tallis argues, "misrepresentation presupposes presentation"—Mary's supposed illusion of learning requires experience to appear illusory *to*. The illusionist strategy trades the hard problem for an equally difficult "illusion problem" that smuggles experience back in. See [[illusionism#Connection to the Knowledge Argument]] for extended treatment.

## Jackson's Self-Rejection

Frank Jackson, the argument's creator, now rejects it. Beginning around 1995 and fully by 2003, Jackson embraced physicalism. He argues that his original conclusion—epiphenomenalism about qualia—leads to a devastating problem: if qualia have no causal power, we couldn't know about them. The very fact that Mary believes she learned something new suggests that her learning causally affects her beliefs. But epiphenomenal qualia couldn't do this.

Jackson's current view combines representationalism (phenomenal properties are representational properties) with elements of the ability hypothesis.

However, Jackson's rejection doesn't settle the debate. Arguments stand or fall on their logic, not their author's endorsement. In a 2023 interview, Jackson acknowledged the argument "should be addressed really seriously if you are a physicalist." Other philosophers—Chalmers, Nida-Rümelin, Alter—continue to defend it. If anything, Jackson's epiphenomenalism worry supports the [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet: consciousness must causally influence our beliefs about it, or we couldn't know about it at all.

## Connection to Related Arguments

The knowledge argument shares deep structure with other anti-physicalist arguments:

**The Explanatory Gap**: Joseph Levine's [[explanatory-gap]] concern is the conceptual counterpart. Mary's Room dramatizes what Levine describes abstractly: physical explanations leave unexplained *why* brain states feel any way at all.

**Conceivability Arguments**: Chalmers connects Mary's Room to [[philosophical-zombies|zombie]] arguments through two-dimensional semantics. If Mary's phenomenal concepts have different "primary intensions" than any physical concepts, zombies are genuinely conceivable and possibly metaphysical—not merely reflections of human ignorance.

**What Is It Like to Be a Bat?**: Thomas Nagel's earlier argument (1974) anticipated Jackson. Nagel argued that knowing all physical facts about bat echolocation wouldn't tell us what it's *like* to be a bat. Mary's Room makes the same point with human consciousness, strengthening it by eliminating species differences.

**The Convergence Argument**: The knowledge argument is not alone. It is one of seven major [[arguments-against-materialism|arguments against materialism]]—alongside the explanatory gap, zombie argument, inverted qualia, Kripke's modal argument, Nagel's subjectivity argument, and quantum mechanical considerations. These arguments proceed through different logical routes, exploit different features of consciousness, yet converge on the same conclusion. Their convergence provides cumulative support stronger than any individual argument could: when multiple independent witnesses tell the same story, the probability of collective error decreases.

## The Introspection Question

Mary's recognition that she learns something new depends on [[introspection]]—her capacity to notice the difference between before and after. This raises a question: might introspective error explain away the intuition?

Critics of introspection argue we routinely confabulate about our mental states. But the relevant findings concern causal *processes*, not phenomenal *content*. Nisbett and Wilson's classic studies show that we lack insight into *why* we choose as we do—not that we misidentify *what* we experience. Mary doesn't need to know why red looks the way it does; she only needs to recognize that her experience has changed qualitatively.

Moreover, contemplative training dramatically improves introspective accuracy. Fox et al. (2012) found that meditation experience predicts the ability to detect subtle phenomenal changes—exactly the skill Mary would employ. If introspection were fundamentally unreliable, no amount of practice should help. The fact that training improves accuracy suggests introspection is a skill that can be refined, not a systematically broken faculty.

The introspection objection thus fails on two fronts: it targets the wrong domain (processes, not contents) and it ignores evidence that phenomenal observation can be trained.

## Process Philosophy Perspective

Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy offers an alternative framing. For Whitehead, reality consists of "actual occasions"—momentary experiential events that cannot be captured from outside. Physical descriptions characterize the *extensive* relationships between occasions—their spatial and temporal structure—but not their *intensive* reality, the subjective immediacy of each occasion.

On this view, Mary's situation illustrates a general truth: structure never entails experience. Physical science describes patterns of relationship, but the intrinsic nature of what stands in those relationships—what Whitehead calls "subjective form"—remains inaccessible from outside. When Mary sees red, she gains access to the subjective form of a new type of occasion, something no external description could provide.

This resonates with Bertrand Russell's insight that physics describes structure without revealing intrinsic nature. [[russellian-monism|Russellian monism]] develops this idea—physical science tells us what things *do*, not what they *are*. Mary learns what color experience *is* by having it, not by knowing what it does.

## What Would Challenge This View?

The knowledge argument would be undermined by any of the following:

1. **Mary predicts correctly**: If someone with only physical knowledge could accurately describe what experiences are like before having them—predicting not just behavior but phenomenal character—this would undermine premise 2. Virtual reality or advanced simulation might someday test whether comprehensive physical knowledge enables accurate phenomenal prediction.

2. **The phenomenal concepts strategy succeeds**: If phenomenal concepts could be shown to be fully physical (including why they require experience for acquisition), the gap between Mary's knowledge states would be merely conceptual. But current versions face Chalmers's dilemma.

3. **Introspection proves systematically unreliable for phenomenal content**: If Mary's report of learning something new could be shown to be confabulation rather than genuine recognition of phenomenal change, the argument's intuitive force would diminish. But the evidence suggests introspection fails for causal processes, not phenomenal content.

4. **Physical completeness is demonstrated**: If a completed physics could derive phenomenal properties the way chemistry derives water's macroscopic properties, the argument would fail. But the explanatory gap shows no sign of closing with increased physical knowledge.

5. **Illusionism is vindicated**: If we could explain why Mary *seems* to learn without invoking phenomenal properties, the argument would lose its force. But the "illusion problem" appears as difficult as the hard problem it replaces.

The argument's resilience comes from its simplicity: it makes minimal assumptions (Mary knows physics, sees color, reports learning) and draws a modest conclusion (not all facts are physical). The burden falls on physicalists to explain away an intuition that even trained philosophers struggle to shake.

## Relation to This Site's Perspective

The knowledge argument provides powerful support for the [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]] tenet. The core claim—that physical knowledge leaves phenomenal knowledge unaddressed—is precisely what the site means by consciousness being irreducible. [[Qualia]] have a qualitative character that no physical description captures.

The argument also supports the [[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]] tenet. Physicalism appears simpler, but its apparent parsimony fails before the knowledge intuition. When the "simpler" theory conflicts with what nearly everyone recognizes, simplicity is not decisive.

The interaction between Mary's learning and Jackson's epiphenomenalism worry illuminates the [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet. If consciousness were causally inert, Mary couldn't form beliefs about her new experiences. But she does—she reports that seeing red is revelatory. Her phenomenal states causally influence her beliefs. Consciousness isn't just correlated with physical processes; it participates in the causal order.
