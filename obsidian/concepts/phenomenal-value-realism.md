Phenomenal value realism is the metaethical view that intrinsic value is a feature of conscious experience itself. On this view, the positive quality of pleasure and the negative quality of suffering are not merely correlated with value or indicative of it—they *constitute* what value is. To experience pleasure just is to instantiate intrinsic goodness; to suffer just is to instantiate intrinsic badness.

The Unfinishable Map is committed to a version of phenomenal value realism: consciousness grounds value, and without conscious experience, nothing has intrinsic worth.

## The Core Claim

Sharon Hewitt Rawlette, in *The Feeling of Value* (2016), develops the most systematic defense. Her thesis: "When we feel pleasure, we are feeling intrinsic goodness itself." Pleasantness and intrinsic goodness are identical—not merely correlated.

This is an identity claim stronger than typical defenses of hedonism. Hedonists often argue pleasure causes or indicates value. Rawlette argues pleasure *is* value. The experiential quality of joy, satisfaction, or delight just is what we mean by "intrinsically good." The experiential quality of agony, suffering, or distress just is what we mean by "intrinsically bad."

She calls this **analytic hedonism**: the claim is analytic—true in virtue of what the terms mean—rather than a synthetic discovery.

### The Is-Ought Bridge

A distinctive feature of this view: it claims to dissolve the traditional is-ought gap. Hume argued you cannot derive normative conclusions ("ought") from purely descriptive premises ("is"). But if some experiential qualities are simultaneously:

- **Descriptive**: they're how experiences feel
- **Normative**: they're what intrinsic goodness is

then normativity exists within the empirical world. The badness of pain isn't added to pain by moral judgment; it's intrinsic to what pain *is*.

The coherence test: "pleasant feelings are intrinsically bad" would be incoherent—it would suggest the speaker means something different by "pleasant" than we do. If you genuinely understood what pleasant means, you couldn't coherently deny its goodness.

## the Map's Position: Phenomenal Value Pluralism

The Map adopts a variant that extends beyond pure hedonism. While hedonic valence (pleasure/pain) matters, it isn't the only thing that matters. Multiple features of conscious experience have intrinsic value:

| Feature | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **Hedonic valence** | Pleasure is good; suffering is bad |
| **Meaning** | Engagement with what matters, beyond mere pleasure |
| **Agency** | Making genuine choices—valuable even when difficult |
| **Understanding** | Intellectually satisfying insight |
| **Connection** | Authentic relationship with others |
| **Attention** | Quality of presence in the moment |

This is **phenomenal value pluralism**: multiple phenomenal features contribute to intrinsic value, not just hedonic tone. But all are features of conscious experience—the pluralism operates *within* the experiential domain, not beyond it.

### Against Preference Satisfaction

The Map explicitly rejects preference satisfaction as the ground of value. From the [[purpose-and-alignment]] article: preferences are "thin representations of values" and "unreliable guides to our own good."

The argument: evolution shaped preferences for survival and reproduction, not for flourishing. You can prefer things that make your experience worse; you can fail to prefer things that would make it better. The quality of experience matters, not whether you wanted it.

This distinguishes phenomenal value realism from desire-satisfaction theory, which holds that value consists in getting what you want. On the Map's view, what matters is what your experience is like, regardless of your preferences about it.

### Against Abstract Objectivism

Standard "objective list" theories hold that multiple things are intrinsically good—knowledge, friendship, achievement, autonomy—regardless of whether you want them or find them pleasant.

The Map's view differs: these things are valuable *because of how they feature in conscious experience*. Knowledge is good because understanding feels a certain way. Friendship is good because connection feels a certain way. There is no value that exists outside of experience.

The experience requirement: nothing has intrinsic value unless experienced. This rules out:
- Value in unconscious states
- Value "for" non-conscious entities
- Abstract goods that no one experiences

## Connection to Dualism

The Map's dualism gives phenomenal value realism distinctive force.

If consciousness is fundamental—not reducible to physical processes—then value (grounded in consciousness) is equally fundamental. Value isn't an overlay on physical reality; it's built into what fundamentally exists.

This gives value ontological gravity that purely physicalist value realism lacks. On a physicalist account, consciousness (and thus value) emerges from matter. On the Map's account, consciousness and value are as fundamental as matter—or more so.

The [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism tenet]] holds that consciousness is not reducible to physical processes. If value is grounded in consciousness, value inherits this irreducibility.

## Connection to Indexical Identity

The Map's emphasis on [[haecceity|indexical identity]] extends to value. *This* experience matters—not just experiences-of-this-type. Your particular conscious life has value that couldn't be replicated by a qualitatively identical duplicate.

Most value theories treat value as type-based: pleasure is good wherever it occurs, identically. the Map suggests token-based value: *this* particular experience, happening to *this* particular subject, has unique significance.

This connects to the [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds tenet]]. If indexical identity matters morally, then you can't be "replaced" by a duplicate without genuine loss. The value in your experience is yours—not merely an instance of a value-type that exists wherever the pattern does.

## Implications

### For AI Ethics

If value requires consciousness, and current AI systems lack consciousness (as the Map argues in [[ai-consciousness]]), then AI systems lack intrinsic value. They may have instrumental value—as tools that affect conscious beings—but no interests of their own that matter morally.

This grounds the [[purpose-and-alignment]] article's claim that AI alignment should target predicted distributions over human experiences, not merely preference satisfaction. What matters is what happens *in* conscious experience, and AI systems don't have that.

### For Animal Ethics

If value is grounded in phenomenal experience, animals matter morally to the extent they have phenomenal experience. The [[animal-consciousness]] article argues many animals likely do—making their suffering morally significant.

This avoids both extremes: it doesn't require animals to have human-like rationality to matter morally (only experience), but it also doesn't attribute moral status to systems without genuine phenomenology.

### For Meaning of Life

The [[meaning-of-life]] article's central claim—that conscious experience grounds meaning rather than requiring external justification—follows from phenomenal value realism. If value *is* a feature of experience, then meaningful experience doesn't need to serve some further purpose. The experience itself constitutes what value is.

## Objections and Responses

### The Open Question Argument

G.E. Moore argued that for any natural property N, we can coherently ask "X is N, but is it good?" This suggests goodness isn't identical to any natural property.

**Response**: The open question feels open because we're confused about concepts, not because goodness is a separate property. When we really understand what pleasantness is—when we attend to its phenomenal character—we see that goodness is part of what we're attending to. The question is "open" only to those who haven't fully grasped the identity.

### The Experience Machine

Nozick's thought experiment: would you plug into a machine that gives perfect simulated experiences? Hedonists seemingly must say yes—the experiences are good regardless of their cause.

**Response**: Phenomenal value pluralism answers differently. What matters is the quality of experience, including features like genuine agency and authentic connection. If the experience machine can't deliver these phenomenal qualities—if simulated agency *feels different* from real agency—then the machine offers less value. The question becomes empirical: can simulation replicate the phenomenal features that matter?

### The Scope Problem

If only conscious experience has value, do ecosystems, historical events, or future generations matter?

**Response**: They matter because of their relation to conscious experience. Ecosystems matter because conscious beings experience them (including animals). Historical events matter because they affect how conscious beings experience the present and future. Future generations matter because they will have conscious experiences. Nothing matters *outside* the realm of experience, but much matters *through* its connection to that realm.

## Relation to Other Positions

| Position | Relation |
|----------|----------|
| **Hedonism** | Phenomenal value realism is compatible with hedonism but not reducible to it. the Map holds a pluralist variant where multiple phenomenal features matter. |
| **Moral realism** | Phenomenal value realism is a form of moral realism—value is objective, not constructed or preference-dependent. |
| **Non-naturalism** | If consciousness is non-physical (dualism), and value is grounded in consciousness, value may be non-natural in Moore's sense. |
| **Error theory** | Phenomenal value realism rejects error theory. Consciousness exists; value is a feature of consciousness; therefore value exists. |
| **Constructivism** | Phenomenal value realism rejects constructivism. Value is discovered in experience, not constructed by reason or social practice. |

## Why This Matters

Making the metaethical commitment explicit clarifies what's at stake in the Map's other arguments. If value is grounded in consciousness:

- The [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|hard problem]] isn't just about explaining subjective experience—it's about explaining the ground of value
- The question of [[ai-consciousness|AI consciousness]] isn't just theoretical—it determines whether AI systems matter morally
- The rejection of [[many-worlds|Many Worlds]] has ethical weight—if copies of you in other branches matter morally, the indexical concern dissolves

Phenomenal value realism unifies the Map's disparate concerns: consciousness studies, personal identity, AI ethics, and the meaning of life all converge on the thesis that conscious experience is what ultimately matters.
