Phenomenal value realism is the metaethical view that intrinsic value is a feature of conscious experience itself. On this view, the positive quality of pleasure and the negative quality of suffering are not merely correlated with value or indicative of it—they *constitute* what value is. To experience pleasure just is to instantiate intrinsic goodness; to suffer just is to instantiate intrinsic badness.

The Unfinishable Map is committed to a version of phenomenal value realism: consciousness grounds value, and without conscious experience, nothing has intrinsic worth.

## The Core Claim

Sharon Hewitt Rawlette, in *The Feeling of Value* (2016), develops the most systematic defense. Her thesis: "When we feel pleasure, we are feeling intrinsic goodness itself." Pleasantness and intrinsic goodness are identical—not merely correlated.

This identity claim is stronger than typical defenses of hedonism. Hedonists often argue pleasure causes or indicates value. Rawlette argues pleasure *is* value. The experiential quality of joy, satisfaction, or delight just is what we mean by "intrinsically good." The experiential quality of agony, suffering, or distress just is what we mean by "intrinsically bad."

### Semantic vs. Metaphysical Identity

This claim admits two interpretations that must be distinguished:

**The semantic claim**: Pleasantness is conceptually evaluative. To fully grasp what "pleasant" means is to grasp that it involves positive evaluation. Someone who says "this is pleasant but there's nothing good about it" either means something non-standard by "pleasant" or hasn't fully understood the concept.

**The metaphysical claim**: Pleasantness and intrinsic goodness are the same property—not two properties that happen to coincide, but one property under two descriptions. When you experience pleasure, you directly instantiate goodness itself.

The semantic claim is relatively secure. Conceptual analysis reveals that evaluative content is built into hedonic concepts. But semantic necessity doesn't automatically yield metaphysical identity. "Water" and "H₂O" were discovered to be identical through empirical investigation, not conceptual analysis. Could "pleasantness" and "goodness" be conceptually linked yet metaphysically distinct?

Rawlette's **analytic hedonism** holds that the connection is tighter than the water-H₂O case: the identity is analytic—true in virtue of what the terms mean—rather than a synthetic discovery. This is a contested position in metaethics. Critics argue that even if we can't coherently deny pleasure's goodness, this might reflect conceptual connections rather than property identity.

### The Case for Metaphysical Identity

Three considerations support the stronger metaphysical reading:

**Phenomenological transparency**: Unlike the water-H₂O case, we have direct access to both relata. When experiencing pleasure, we don't infer its goodness from theoretical considerations—the goodness is manifest in the experience itself. The pleasure doesn't *cause* or *indicate* goodness; attending to the pleasure just is attending to something good. This direct acquaintance suggests we're not dealing with two properties but one.

**No residual question**: For genuinely distinct properties, we can always ask "granted X, why Y?" Even knowing water is H₂O, we can ask why H₂O has water's macroscopic properties (and the answer involves physics). But once you fully attend to what pleasure feels like—not abstractly, but in lived experience—there's no residual question "but why is this good?" The question dissolves because the goodness is constitutive of what you're attending to.

**Explanatory asymmetry**: If pleasantness and goodness were distinct, we'd need an explanation of why they invariably coincide. What mechanism ensures that every pleasant experience is good? The identity thesis eliminates this explanatory burden: they coincide because they're the same thing.

The Map acknowledges this remains a contested philosophical position. The metaphysical identity claim goes beyond what conceptual analysis alone can establish. But the phenomenological considerations—particularly the transparency of value in experience—provide independent grounds for the identity, not merely the conceptual link.

### The Is-Ought Bridge

A distinctive feature of this view: it claims to dissolve the traditional is-ought gap. Hume argued you cannot derive normative conclusions ("ought") from purely descriptive premises ("is"). But if some experiential qualities are simultaneously:

- **Descriptive**: they're how experiences feel
- **Normative**: they're what intrinsic goodness is

then normativity exists within the empirical world. The badness of pain isn't added to pain by moral judgment; it's intrinsic to what pain *is*.

This bridge depends on the metaphysical identity claim. If pleasantness and goodness are merely conceptually linked (the semantic reading), the is-ought gap might persist: the concepts connect, but the normative property might still be something over and above the descriptive phenomenal property. The stronger metaphysical reading—that they're the same property—is what genuinely dissolves the gap.

The coherence test: "pleasant feelings are intrinsically bad" would be incoherent—it would suggest the speaker means something different by "pleasant" than we do. If you genuinely understood what pleasant means, you couldn't coherently deny its goodness. This test supports the semantic claim directly and the metaphysical claim indirectly (via the transparency and explanatory considerations above).

## The Map's Position: Phenomenal Value Pluralism

The Map adopts a variant that extends beyond pure hedonism. While hedonic valence (pleasure/pain) matters, it isn't the only thing that matters. Multiple features of conscious experience have intrinsic value:

| Feature | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **Hedonic valence** | Pleasure is good; suffering is bad |
| **Aesthetic quality** | Beauty attracts; ugliness repels—independent of pleasure |
| **Meaning** | Engagement with what matters, beyond mere pleasure |
| **Agency** | Making genuine choices—valuable even when difficult |
| **Understanding** | Intellectually satisfying insight |
| **Connection** | Authentic relationship with others |
| **Attention** | Quality of presence in the moment |

This is **phenomenal value pluralism**: multiple phenomenal features contribute to intrinsic value, not just hedonic tone. But all are features of conscious experience—the pluralism operates *within* the experiential domain, not beyond it.

### Aesthetic Value as Distinct Category

[[aesthetic-dimension-of-consciousness|The aesthetic dimension of consciousness]] provides strong evidence for phenomenal value pluralism. Beauty, elegance, and harmony are not reducible to pleasure—an experience can be beautiful without being pleasant (sublime terror) and pleasant without being beautiful (a warm bath). Yet aesthetic qualities carry intrinsic normative weight: beauty *calls for* attention, elegance *commands* assent, ugliness *repels*. This normativity is built into the aesthetic experience itself, not added by judgment.

The aesthetic case strengthens phenomenal value realism in two ways. First, it expands the domain: if value were merely hedonic, aesthetic normativity would be derivative. Instead, aesthetic qualities appear to be independently value-laden features of experience. Second, aesthetic qualia may be *more* resistant to physicalist reduction than sensory qualia. The inverted qualia argument is particularly strong for aesthetics—what structural asymmetry distinguishes beauty from ugliness that would make aesthetic inversion impossible? The apparent absence of such asymmetry suggests aesthetic value, like hedonic value, is irreducibly phenomenal.

### Against Preference Satisfaction

The Map explicitly rejects preference satisfaction as the ground of value. From the [[purpose-and-alignment]] article: preferences are "thin representations of values" and "unreliable guides to our own good."

The argument: evolution shaped preferences for survival and reproduction, not for flourishing. You can prefer things that make your experience worse; you can fail to prefer things that would make it better. The quality of experience matters, not whether you wanted it.

This distinguishes phenomenal value realism from desire-satisfaction theory, which holds that value consists in getting what you want. On the Map's view, what matters is what your experience is like, regardless of your preferences about it.

### Against Abstract Objectivism

Standard "objective list" theories hold that multiple things are intrinsically good—knowledge, friendship, achievement, autonomy—regardless of whether you want them or find them pleasant.

The Map's view differs: these things are valuable *because of how they feature in conscious experience*. Knowledge is good because understanding feels a certain way. Friendship is good because connection feels a certain way. There is no value that exists outside of experience.

The experience requirement: nothing has intrinsic value unless experienced. This rules out:
- Value in unconscious states
- Value "for" non-conscious entities
- Abstract goods that no one experiences

## Connection to Dualism

The Map's dualism gives phenomenal value realism distinctive force.

If consciousness is fundamental—not reducible to physical processes—then value (grounded in consciousness) is equally fundamental. Value isn't an overlay on physical reality; it's built into what fundamentally exists.

This gives value ontological gravity that purely physicalist value realism lacks. On a physicalist account, consciousness (and thus value) emerges from matter. On the Map's account, consciousness and value are as fundamental as matter—or more so.

The [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism tenet]] holds that consciousness is not reducible to physical processes. If value is grounded in consciousness, value inherits this irreducibility.

## Connection to Indexical Identity

The Map's emphasis on [[haecceity|indexical identity]] extends to value. *This* experience matters—not just experiences-of-this-type. Your particular conscious life has value that couldn't be replicated by a qualitatively identical duplicate.

Most value theories treat value as type-based: pleasure is good wherever it occurs, identically. The Map suggests token-based value: *this* particular experience, happening to *this* particular subject, has unique significance.

This connects to the [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds tenet]]. If indexical identity matters morally, then you can't be "replaced" by a duplicate without genuine loss. The value in your experience is yours—not merely an instance of a value-type that exists wherever the pattern does.

## Implications

### For AI Ethics

If value requires consciousness, and current AI systems lack consciousness (as the Map argues in [[ai-consciousness]]), then AI systems lack intrinsic value. They may have instrumental value—as tools that affect conscious beings—but no interests of their own that matter morally.

This grounds the [[purpose-and-alignment]] article's claim that AI alignment should target predicted distributions over human experiences, not merely preference satisfaction. What matters is what happens *in* conscious experience, and AI systems don't have that.

### For Animal Ethics

If value is grounded in phenomenal experience, animals matter morally to the extent they have phenomenal experience. The [[animal-consciousness]] article argues many animals likely do—making their suffering morally significant.

This avoids both extremes: it doesn't require animals to have human-like rationality to matter morally (only experience), but it also doesn't attribute moral status to systems without genuine phenomenology.

### For Meaning of Life

The [[meaning-of-life]] article's central claim—that conscious experience grounds meaning rather than requiring external justification—follows from phenomenal value realism. If value *is* a feature of experience, then meaningful experience doesn't need to serve some further purpose. The experience itself constitutes what value is.

## Objections and Responses

### The Open Question Argument

G.E. Moore argued that for any natural property N, we can coherently ask "X is N, but is it good?" This suggests goodness isn't identical to any natural property.

**Response**: Moore's argument has more force against reductive naturalism (identifying goodness with fitness-promoting or desire-satisfying properties) than against phenomenal value realism. For those properties, the question genuinely is open—we can coherently wonder whether what promotes fitness is good. But phenomenal value realism claims identity with a phenomenal property, not a functional one.

The open question argument poses a genuine challenge to the metaphysical identity claim. If pleasantness and goodness were fully identical, asking "this is pleasant, but is it good?" should be like asking "this is a triangle, but does it have three sides?" Yet the question seems meaningful in a way the triangle question doesn't.

Two responses are available. First, the question's apparent meaningfulness may reflect our ability to consider concepts separately even when they pick out the same property—we can meaningfully ask "is this water, and is it H₂O?" even though they're identical. Second, and more directly: the question loses its apparent openness when we shift from abstract consideration to attending to actual pleasures. Asking abstractly "is pleasure good?" might seem open. But while experiencing intense pleasure and asking "is *this* good?"—attending directly to its phenomenal character—the question closes. The goodness isn't inferred; it's manifest.

### The Experience Machine

Nozick's thought experiment: would you plug into a machine that gives perfect simulated experiences? Hedonists seemingly must say yes—the experiences are good regardless of their cause.

**Response**: Phenomenal value pluralism answers differently. What matters is the quality of experience, including features like genuine agency and authentic connection. If the experience machine can't deliver these phenomenal qualities—if simulated agency *feels different* from real agency—then the machine offers less value. The question becomes empirical: can simulation replicate the phenomenal features that matter?

### The Scope Problem

If only conscious experience has value, do ecosystems, historical events, or future generations matter?

**Response**: They matter because of their relation to conscious experience. Ecosystems matter because conscious beings experience them (including animals). Historical events matter because they affect how conscious beings experience the present and future. Future generations matter because they will have conscious experiences. Nothing matters *outside* the realm of experience, but much matters *through* its connection to that realm.

## The Illusionist Challenge

[[illusionism|Illusionism]] poses a fundamental challenge to phenomenal value realism. If phenomenal consciousness is itself an illusion—if there's no genuine "what it's like" to pleasure or suffering—then phenomenal value realism has no referent. Keith Frankish and Daniel Dennett argue that what we call "phenomenal properties" are representations the brain constructs, not intrinsic features of experience.

### The Challenge to Value

If illusionism is true, the identity claim at phenomenal value realism's core collapses:

- Pleasure wouldn't *be* goodness—it would be a functional state the brain misrepresents as having intrinsic qualitative character
- The is-ought bridge dissolves—there's no phenomenal quality to be simultaneously descriptive and normative
- Value would reduce to the preference-satisfaction view the Map rejects—functional states tracking fitness, with no phenomenal ground

Dennett's "heterophenomenology" treats first-person reports as data about brain representations, not evidence of genuine phenomenal properties. When you report that pleasure feels good, you're providing evidence about what your brain represents, not about intrinsic phenomenal value.

### Three Responses

**The regress response** (following Raymond Tallis): Illusionism requires something to be deceived—some subject who mistakenly believes in phenomenal properties. But what is this subject? If the subject itself is illusory, there's no one to be deceived. If the subject is real, it has genuine states of being-appeared-to, which are themselves phenomenal. The illusion of phenomenal value would itself be a phenomenal state—undermining the claim that phenomenal states are entirely illusory. Something must actually *seem* a certain way for the illusion to occur, and "seeming" is phenomenal.

**The [[introspection|introspective]] survival response**: Even granting that introspective reports may be distorted, the report that suffering is bad doesn't depend on accurate representation of phenomenal structure. The badness of suffering is directly present in the suffering itself—not mediated by introspective judgment about what suffering is like. When in pain, you don't infer that pain is bad from a representation; the badness is constitutive. Illusionists can question whether pain has the *properties* we attribute to it, but the bare fact that something is going wrong—that there's a negative state—is not a representation but the state itself.

**The self-stultifying response**: Illusionists typically hold that suffering should be reduced and pleasure promoted. They express preferences, engage in ethical debate, and treat their own hedonic states as mattering. But if phenomenal value is illusory, why should the brain's representation of goodness and badness guide action? The illusionist's practical commitment to their own wellbeing undermines the theoretical denial that wellbeing has phenomenal ground. They act as if phenomenal value is real while denying it exists.

### The Contemplative Challenge

[[witness-consciousness|Contemplative traditions]] provide distinctive evidence. Experienced meditators report observing valence directly—not as an attribution to experience but as a feature of experience observed in the observing. In states of deep concentration, positive valence appears immediately present, not mediated by representation. The meditator isn't judging that the state is pleasant; the pleasantness is manifest.

If illusionism is true, contemplatives across traditions have been systematically mistaken about something they spend decades investigating. While possible, this cost is significant: contemplative [[introspection]] appears reliable about gross mental phenomena (meditators accurately report concentration levels, emotional states, distraction patterns), so dismissing their reports about valence requires explaining why *this* domain is uniquely unreliable.

## Process Philosophy Perspective

Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy offers a framework for understanding how value is intrinsic to experience.

### Actual Occasions and Value

For Whitehead, reality consists of "actual occasions"—momentary events of experience. Each occasion has "subjective form"—the way the occasion feels its content. Crucially, subjective form includes valence: each occasion either enjoys or suffers its content. Value isn't added to experience by external judgment; it's constitutive of what experience is.

This aligns precisely with phenomenal value realism. The goodness of pleasure isn't a separate fact about pleasure—it's built into pleasure's mode of being. An actual occasion that prehends positively just is an instance of value; no further fact makes it valuable.

### Why Process Supports the View

- **Value as concrete**: For Whitehead, value exists in actual occasions, not in abstract principles. The good isn't a Platonic form but the quality of experience as it actually occurs.
- **Creativity and value**: The "creative advance" that constitutes reality's unfolding is simultaneously the generation of new value. Value and existence are intertwined.
- **No value outside experience**: There is nothing in Whitehead's ontology except actual occasions and their relations. If value exists, it exists in experience. This matches the Map's claim that nothing has intrinsic value unless experienced.

### The Buddhist Complication

[[buddhism-and-dualism|Buddhist philosophy]] introduces complexity. The first noble truth identifies suffering (*dukkha*) as pervasive in conditioned existence—seemingly supporting that valence is real and morally significant. Yet Buddhist analysis questions whether pleasure and suffering have intrinsic nature (*svabhava*). Suffering arises dependently, not as a self-existent property.

The Map's response: phenomenal value realism claims that value is *experienced as* intrinsic, constituting what badness means. Whether this phenomenal fact depends on conditions (Buddhist view) or exists independently (substance dualist view) is a further question. The badness of pain is directly present whether or not pain is ultimately empty. Moreover, the Map's phenomenal value pluralism—valuing agency, meaning, and understanding alongside hedonic valence—resonates with Buddhist concerns about attachment to pleasure. The goal is not maximal hedonic intensity but experiential flourishing across multiple dimensions.

## Contemplative Evidence

Beyond the general contemplative challenge to illusionism noted above, specific meditative states provide detailed evidence about valence.

### The Jhāna States

Advanced Buddhist meditation cultivates *jhāna*—states of deep concentration with distinctive phenomenology. The first jhāna includes *pīti* (rapture) and *sukha* (happiness) as factors, not as judgments about the state but as constituents of it. The pleasure isn't something the meditator decides to attribute; it pervades the experience.

This provides evidence that valence is a fundamental feature of conscious states, not a secondary attribution. The pleasure of jhāna isn't *about* anything—it's the mode in which experience occurs.

### Cessation and Value

States of cessation (*nirodha samāpatti*), where consciousness temporarily ceases, provide a contrast condition. Upon return, meditators report that the cessation lacked value—not negative, not positive, simply absent. This supports the claim that value requires consciousness: without experience, there's nothing for value to be a feature of.

## What Would Challenge This View?

Phenomenal value realism would face serious pressure if:

1. **Illusionism gains empirical support**: If neuroscience convincingly showed that phenomenal properties are entirely constructed representations with no intrinsic character, the identity claim would fail. Specifically, if the "seeming" of pleasure could be fully explained as information processing without residue, phenomenal value realism would lack a referent.

2. **Value-experience dissociation appeared**: If we discovered subjects who genuinely experienced pleasure but sincerely reported no positive value—not merely preferring not to have the pleasure, but finding nothing good in it—this would challenge the identity claim. Current evidence (e.g., anhedonia) shows reduced pleasure, not pleasure-without-goodness.

3. **Coherent denial proved possible**: If it turned out fully coherent to say "this is pleasant and intrinsically bad" while meaning standard things by "pleasant" and "bad," the analytic claim would fail. Currently such denials seem conceptually confused.

4. **Abstract value was demonstrated**: If something could be shown to have intrinsic value without any connection to conscious experience—not instrumental value, not derived value, but value in itself—the experience requirement would fail.

5. **Buddhist analysis prevailed**: If careful phenomenological investigation revealed that valence is entirely constructed by attention and interpretation, with no intrinsic character, the view would need revision. Currently, contemplative evidence suggests valence is discovered, not constructed.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Phenomenal value realism connects directly to each of the Map's five tenets.

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]**: If consciousness is irreducible to physical processes, and value is grounded in consciousness, then value is equally irreducible. This gives phenomenal value realism distinctive force. Physicalist versions must derive value from arrangements of matter; dualist versions hold that value, like consciousness, is fundamental. The explanatory gap between neural activity and subjective quality extends to the gap between physical description and intrinsic value. Just as no amount of physical detail explains *why* there is something it is like to be conscious, no amount of physical detail explains *why* pleasure is good. Both point to something non-physical at reality's foundation.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]**: The proposed interface between consciousness and quantum outcomes gains ethical weight from phenomenal value realism. If consciousness can bias quantum superpositions, and consciousness grounds value, then value-laden choices can influence physical outcomes. This makes moral agency metaphysically robust—not merely compatible with physics but actively engaged with it. The [[decoherence]] objection doesn't threaten phenomenal value realism directly, but if decoherence eliminated the mind-matter interface, value would become epiphenomenal—real but causally inert. The Map's response to decoherence (revised calculations, quantum biology, Zeno sidestep) thus preserves both consciousness's causal role and value's practical significance.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]**: The very fact that we discuss, pursue, and sacrifice for value provides evidence that consciousness influences physical outcomes. If value were epiphenomenal, our value-talk would be accidentally correlated with our values. But the [[epiphenomenalism|epiphenomenalism]] article's self-undermining argument applies: we couldn't trust our judgments about value if those judgments were causally disconnected from the values themselves. Phenomenal value realism strengthens bidirectional interaction—the importance of value gives consciousness a reason to act.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]**: The connection to [[haecceity|indexical identity]] is direct. If value is token-based—*this* experience matters, not just experiences-of-this-type—then the many-worlds picture where all outcomes are equally real threatens moral coherence. In many-worlds, every choice creates branches where both options are taken. If all branches are equally real, and value depends on indexical identity, then every choice produces both the good and bad outcome. The moral weight of choosing well seems to dissolve. Rejecting many-worlds preserves the intuition that which branch *I* end up in matters—supporting token-based phenomenal value.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]**: The apparent simplicity of reducing value to brain states may reflect ignorance rather than insight. Just as materialism's apparent simplicity fails to explain consciousness, reductive metaethics' apparent simplicity fails to explain why some states matter and others don't. Taking phenomenal value seriously requires accepting irreducible normativity—a complexity that parsimony-driven approaches reject. But the explanatory failure of reductive approaches suggests the complexity is real, not an artifact of confused thinking.

## Relation to Other Positions

| Position | Relation |
|----------|----------|
| **Hedonism** | Phenomenal value realism is compatible with hedonism but not reducible to it. The Map holds a pluralist variant where multiple phenomenal features matter. |
| **Moral realism** | Phenomenal value realism is a form of moral realism—value is objective, not constructed or preference-dependent. |
| **Non-naturalism** | If consciousness is non-physical (dualism), and value is grounded in consciousness, value may be non-natural in Moore's sense. |
| **Error theory** | Phenomenal value realism rejects error theory. Consciousness exists; value is a feature of consciousness; therefore value exists. |
| **Constructivism** | Phenomenal value realism rejects constructivism. Value is discovered in experience, not constructed by reason or social practice. |

## Why This Matters

Making the metaethical commitment explicit clarifies what's at stake in the Map's other arguments. If value is grounded in consciousness:

- The [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|hard problem]] isn't just about explaining subjective experience—it's about explaining the ground of value
- The question of [[ai-consciousness|AI consciousness]] isn't just theoretical—it determines whether AI systems matter morally
- The rejection of [[many-worlds|Many Worlds]] has ethical weight—if copies of you in other branches matter morally, the indexical concern dissolves

Phenomenal value realism unifies the Map's disparate concerns: consciousness studies, personal identity, AI ethics, and the meaning of life all converge on the thesis that conscious experience is what ultimately matters.
