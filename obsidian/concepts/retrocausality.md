Retrocausality is the hypothesis that causation can operate backward in time—that future events can influence past ones. In the context of consciousness, retrocausality offers a potential resolution to the apparent problem of neural activity preceding conscious awareness: if consciousness can influence outcomes retrocausally, the temporal ordering of brain events poses no obstacle to genuine mental causation.

This concept matters for The Unfinishable Map's framework because the [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction tenet]] holds that consciousness causally influences the physical world. Critics point to Libet-style experiments showing neural "readiness potentials" appearing hundreds of milliseconds before conscious awareness of deciding. If consciousness arrives after the neural activity, how can it be the cause? On retrocausal interpretations of quantum mechanics, this objection dissolves—though accepting such interpretations requires adopting a minority view in physics.

## The Puzzle of Temporal Ordering

[[libet-experiments|Benjamin Libet's experiments]] (1983) and subsequent studies by Soon et al. (2008) revealed that brain activity predictive of a decision can occur before a person becomes aware of deciding. The readiness potential appears ~350ms before conscious awareness; fMRI studies extended this to seconds. Importantly, Schurger et al. (2012) challenged the standard interpretation, arguing the readiness potential may be neural noise rather than decision preparation—but even if this critique succeeds, retrocausality offers a more fundamental resolution.

This poses an apparent problem: if the neural activity comes first, isn't consciousness merely informed of decisions already made? Doesn't this reduce consciousness to an epiphenomenon—a passenger rather than a driver?

The retrocausal response: temporal precedence does not establish causal priority. If effects can precede causes, then consciousness occurring "after" neural activity is no obstacle to consciousness being the cause. This response requires accepting an interpretation of quantum mechanics that includes retrocausality—a coherent option, but not the mainstream one.

## Retrocausality in Physics

Retrocausality has serious proponents and empirical grounding in physics.

**Time-symmetric equations**: Quantum mechanics' fundamental equations work equally well forward or backward. The apparent "arrow of time" in measurement is an addition to the formalism. As Huw Price argues, if physics is time-symmetric and causal, retrocausality follows necessarily. See [[time-symmetric-physics]] for how T-symmetry operates across physics domains, and [[collapse-and-time]] for how collapse introduces temporal asymmetry.

**Wheeler's delayed-choice**: Experiments confirm that measurement choices made *after* a particle passes through a double-slit can determine whether it behaved as wave or particle *earlier*. The 2017 satellite experiment extended this over thousands of kilometres. Wheeler extended this cosmologically in his [[the-participatory-universe|participatory universe]]—future observers retroactively selecting the entire cosmic history. See [[prebiotic-collapse#Wheeler's Participatory Universe]] for how this addresses the question of what collapsed wavefunctions before consciousness existed.

**The transactional interpretation**: Cramer's interpretation (1986) makes retrocausality explicit. Quantum events involve offer waves propagating forward, confirmation waves propagating backward, and an atemporal "handshake" that creates the transaction. The wave function is physically real; collapse occurs along the entire transaction simultaneously.

Tim Maudlin (2011) mounted the most influential challenge. His "contingent absorber" thought experiment places an absorber whose position depends on whether a particle has already been detected elsewhere. The confirmation wave from the contingent absorber presupposes the outcome it is supposed to help determine, creating a causal loop in which the probabilities become either inconsistent or undefined. This is a genuine problem for Cramer's original formulation.

Ruth Kastner's possibilist transactional interpretation (PTI) responds by relocating offer and confirmation waves to a pre-spacetime realm of possibilities rather than actual spacetime (Kastner 2012). On PTI, the contingent absorber setup cannot be constructed as described—macroscopic absorber positions are already determined by prior transactions. Kastner (2016) further argues that extending TI to the relativistic domain eliminates the Maudlin challenge entirely, since composite systems like atoms cannot serve as the slow-moving quantum objects Maudlin's setup requires. Peter Lewis (2013) contested the adequacy of these responses; Kastner (2014) replied. The debate has reached a stable impasse rather than resolution—typical of quantum interpretation disputes, where empirical tests cannot currently distinguish the candidates.

The transactional interpretation thus remains contested but not refuted. The Map's use of TI as a framework for retrocausal consciousness should be understood accordingly: it is a coherent option, not an established fact.

**Bell tests**: Retrocausal models offer an alternative to nonlocality for explaining entanglement correlations—later measurements retroactively influence earlier states, preserving locality at the cost of temporal direction.

## Application to Consciousness

The Map's [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] and [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenets propose that consciousness selects among superposed neural states. Applying this retrocausally requires adopting the transactional interpretation (or something like it)—a minority position in physics whose core debate with critics has reached a stable impasse. What follows is conditional on TI's correctness:

1. **If** TI is correct, quantum events involve atemporal handshakes between offer and confirmation waves. The brain prepares multiple possible action patterns as a superposition.
2. **If** consciousness operates at the level of these handshakes, it "selects" which pattern becomes actual—not by adding exotic causal powers, but by participating in a process TI says already exists.
3. **If** the selection propagates retrocausally (as TI's time-symmetric structure implies), it determines which neural history becomes real.
4. Under these conditions, the readiness potential is part of the selected package, not a prior cause.

Each "if" is genuinely uncertain. The transactional interpretation is contested (see the Maudlin debate above). The claim that consciousness interfaces with quantum transactions is speculative. The conjunction—TI is correct *and* consciousness participates in handshakes *and* this dissolves the timing puzzle—remains an open question, not an established result.

Retrocausality is also not the only route to dissolving the Libet problem. The Schurger neural-noise reinterpretation and classical models of temporally extended decision-making offer resolutions that require less interpretational commitment. Retrocausality provides the most radical dissolution; the alternatives chip away at the premises.

The [[quantum-indeterminacy-free-will|systematic treatment of quantum indeterminacy and free will]] develops this in detail.

### The Atemporal Selection Model

If the transactional interpretation is correct—including a satisfactory response to Maudlin's contingent absorber challenge—and if consciousness operates at the level of the quantum handshake, then asking "when does consciousness make the decision?" may be the wrong question. The decision isn't made *at* a time; it determines *which* times become real. See [[collapse-and-time]] for the implications. Both premises are contested; the package is coherent but speculative.

### Addressing Objections

**Can we change history?** No—retrocausality doesn't imply altering established facts. The handshake creates a consistent transaction; the retrocausal influence is part of how the one real history came to be.

**Isn't this unfalsifiable?** All quantum interpretations (Copenhagen, Many-Worlds, Bohmian) make identical predictions for currently testable scenarios. The question is which makes best sense of what we observe. This cuts both ways: retrocausality cannot be empirically established, but neither can it be empirically refuted by appealing to interpretations that deny it.

**Why consciousness specifically?** The claim isn't that consciousness *adds* retrocausal powers but that physics already includes retrocausality, and consciousness operates at the level where this matters.

## Connection to Quantum Consciousness Mechanisms

Retrocausality complements [[quantum-consciousness|quantum consciousness mechanisms]] like Orch OR and Stapp's quantum Zeno. These explain *where* consciousness interfaces with quantum processes; retrocausality explains *how* the temporal ordering puzzle dissolves. Both benefit because consciousness need not "speed up" to precede neural preparation—the collapse and its preparation form an atemporal transaction.

### Motor Selection: Independent Corroboration

The retrocausal framework gains support from [[motor-selection|motor control research]]. Willed movement shows the same neural signatures as willed attention—frontal theta oscillations, ~300ms deployment time. Two independent domains showing identical selection architecture suggests the framework captures something real.

The Libet challenge to motor control has also weakened: Sjöberg (2024) showed that surgical resection of the supplementary motor area doesn't impair voluntary action. The readiness potential may be preparation for execution, not the decision itself.

## The Decoherence Challenge

How do retrocausal influences propagate through systems that have undergone [[decoherence]]? This is a serious open challenge that the Map takes seriously rather than dismissing. Three considerations bear on it:

(1) **The measurement problem persists after decoherence.** Decoherence selects preferred bases—which *kind* of outcome becomes possible—but does not explain why one particular outcome occurs rather than another. Something must select the actual outcome. Retrocausality offers a candidate for this selection that operates at the point of measurement, not during the coherence period. The transaction requires boundary conditions at both temporal ends, not sustained superposition.

(2) **Decoherence timescales are empirically contested.** Tegmark (2000) calculated coherence times of 10⁻¹³ seconds for neural microtubules, but Hagan, Hameroff, and Tuszynski (2002) challenged his model parameters, obtaining estimates seven orders of magnitude longer. This debate remains unresolved—no experiment has directly measured coherence times in living neural tissue. See [[decoherence|the decoherence article]] for full analysis of the Tegmark-Hameroff debate and recent experimental developments.

(3) **Biological quantum effects demonstrate that evolution can exploit coherence.** Avian magnetoreception relies on quantum spin coherence persisting for microseconds in warm biological systems. If evolution can harness quantum effects for navigation, the categorical claim that warm biology excludes quantum effects is empirically false—though whether neural systems exploit similar mechanisms remains an open question.

The transactional picture adds a subtlety: the handshake is atemporal. Decoherence establishes which basis states are available; retrocausality determines which becomes actual. But this framework depends on the transactional interpretation being correct, and the decoherence challenge applies to any quantum consciousness mechanism that retrocausality is paired with.

## The Illusionist Challenge

[[illusionism|Illusionists]] argue retrocausality solves a non-problem: if phenomenal experience is representational fiction, nothing is threatened by Libet. But the regress problem applies—an illusion must appear to something. Even illusionist "seemings" face the temporal ordering puzzle. And the functional asymmetry remains: voluntary actions differ from reflexes, and whatever generates this difference must interface with neural preparation. See [[introspection]] for why phenomenological data survives debunking attempts.

## Contemplative Evidence

[[witness-consciousness|Meditation traditions]] report experiences bearing on retrocausality. Advanced meditators describe awareness standing "outside" temporal flow, observing rather than being carried along. This provides phenomenological support for the atemporal selection model—the witness doesn't experience itself as "before" or "after" its objects.

The phenomenology of decision also supports retrocausality: deliberation involves weighing options, then one option "crystallizing" into actuality. This crystallization feels like genuine selection, not passive observation. Retrocausality vindicates this—the selection *is* genuine, determining the entire transaction including its temporal preparation. The [[temporal-phenomenology-quantum-selection|temporal phenomenology of quantum selection]] develops this point, arguing that the felt openness of deliberation (protention) and the fixedness of what has been decided (retention) are the experiential signatures of uncollapsed and collapsed quantum states.

## Time Ontology and Retrocausality

The transactional interpretation requires confirmation waves from the future—but if the future doesn't exist yet (presentism), what sends them? This seems to favour eternalism. Yet the Map requires real collapse, introducing genuine temporal asymmetry. See [[philosophy-of-time]] for the full treatment.

The Map's [[time-collapse-and-agency|temporal framework]] proposes a **modified growing block**: retrocausality operates within time-symmetric physics *before* collapse establishes temporal direction. The "future" participating in transactions is the space of quantum possibilities, not ontologically existing future facts. Collapse—including consciousness-mediated selection—determines which possibilities become the single actual history.

## Presentiment Research

Separate from physics-based retrocausality, parapsychological "presentiment" research claims physiological responses precede randomly selected future stimuli. Meta-analyses report small effects, but skeptics cite replication failures, Bayesian reanalysis showing weak evidence, and biological implausibility. See [[presentiment-and-retrocausality]] for a detailed treatment distinguishing the two lines of inquiry.

The Map grounds retrocausality in physics—the transactional interpretation, Wheeler's delayed-choice, time-symmetric equations—not parapsychology. The mechanism gap matters: neural quantum selection involves quantum events at synapses and ion channels, plausibly interfacing with measurement. Presentiment would require amplifying retrocausality to coordinated responses across millions of cells anticipating external events—a qualitatively larger gap. Even if presentiment were genuine, it concerns *unconscious* anticipation, not *conscious* selection. The Map acknowledges this research as contested while maintaining its physics-based commitments.

## What Would Challenge This View?

The hypothesis would face serious challenge from: (1) experimental falsification distinguishing retrocausal from non-retrocausal interpretations; (2) success of the illusionist program explaining consciousness without genuine selection; (3) alternative Libet resolutions (like Schurger's neural noise interpretation) eliminating the timing puzzle; (4) discovery that consciousness operates entirely through classical computation; or (5) incoherence of the modified growing block time ontology.

None of these currently succeeds, but they mark conditions under which the framework would fail.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Retrocausality connects to all five tenets:

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]**: If consciousness is irreducible to physical processes, its relationship to those processes requires explanation. Retrocausality shows how consciousness can causally influence neural activity even when that activity precedes conscious awareness in the linear temporal sequence. The dualist commitment that consciousness is something over and above the brain gains coherence when the temporal relationship between them is understood retrocausally.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]**: Retrocausality operates specifically at the quantum level—at measurement events where indeterminacy resolves into definite outcomes. The transactional interpretation makes minimal assumptions: physics already contains time-symmetric equations, and retrocausality follows from taking that symmetry seriously. Consciousness doesn't add exotic causal powers; it participates in quantum processes that already have retrocausal structure. This aligns with the tenet's emphasis on the smallest possible interface.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]**: Retrocausality is most directly relevant here. The Libet experiments seemed to threaten bidirectional interaction by showing neural activity precedes conscious awareness. Retrocausality would dissolve this threat—if the retrocausal interpretation is correct. Consciousness can genuinely select outcomes even when its awareness appears "after" the neural preparation—because temporal precedence doesn't establish causal priority when effects can precede causes. The brain presents options; consciousness selects; the selection determines which neural history becomes actual, including the apparent "preparation."

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]**: Retrocausality supports single-outcome interpretations. The transactional interpretation produces one actual history, not branching worlds. The handshake between offer and confirmation waves determines which outcome becomes real; there are no equally real alternatives persisting in parallel. This connects to [[haecceity]]: the selected history is *this* history, with haecceitistic identity that branching models cannot capture. You don't merely find yourself in one branch—you *are* one history, selected through the atemporal transaction.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]**: Retrocausality seems exotic from a classical perspective—backward causation offends common-sense intuitions about time. But quantum mechanics already challenged classical intuitions fundamentally. Time-symmetric physics is no more ontologically extravagant than time-asymmetric physics; it just seems unfamiliar. The appearance of simplicity that classical temporal ordering provides may reflect our cognitive limitations, not reality's structure. Occam's Razor cannot adjudicate between interpretations that make identical predictions; and the familiar might not be simpler, only more comfortable.

This doesn't prove the tenets are correct. It shows that a coherent physical picture exists in which:
- Consciousness causally influences the brain
- Neural activity can precede conscious awareness
- These two facts are fully compatible

The Libet experiments don't refute conscious causation—provided one accepts an interpretation of physics that includes retrocausality. On standard interpretations that deny backward causation, the temporal ordering remains problematic. The Map's position is that retrocausal interpretations are sufficiently well-developed and physically motivated that the Libet objection is not decisive. Whether retrocausality is actually true remains an open question in physics; the point is that a coherent option exists under which conscious causation survives Libet intact.

<!-- AI REFINEMENT LOG - 2026-02-20
Changes made:
- Restructured four-step consciousness model: each step now explicitly conditional ("If TI is correct...", "If consciousness operates at handshake level...") rather than presenting the model first and caveating afterward
- Added explicit paragraph noting each "if" is genuinely uncertain, with the conjunction remaining an open question
- Separated the Schurger/classical alternatives into their own paragraph for clearer contrast
- Condensed atemporal selection model to foreground both premises (TI correctness + Maudlin response) before the conclusion
- Language fixes: "This seems to pose a problem" → "This poses an apparent problem"; removed hedging "perhaps" from Bidirectional Interaction tenet connection

Based on pessimistic-2026-02-20-evening.md Issue #1: consciousness-application section presented a detailed model on TI foundation described as "stable impasse" with caveats structurally subordinate to the model.
Key improvements: TI dependence foregrounded at each step; conditional structure made explicit throughout.

This log should be removed after human review.
