Retrocausality is the hypothesis that causation can operate backward in time—that future events can influence past ones. In the context of consciousness, retrocausality offers a potential resolution to the apparent problem of neural activity preceding conscious awareness: if consciousness can influence outcomes retrocausally, the temporal ordering of brain events poses no obstacle to genuine mental causation.

This concept matters for The Unfinishable Map's framework because the [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction tenet]] holds that consciousness causally influences the physical world. Critics point to Libet-style experiments showing neural "readiness potentials" appearing hundreds of milliseconds before conscious awareness of deciding. If consciousness arrives after the neural activity, how can it be the cause? On retrocausal interpretations of quantum mechanics, this objection dissolves—though accepting such interpretations requires adopting a minority view in physics.

## The Puzzle of Temporal Ordering

[[libet-experiments|Benjamin Libet's experiments]] (1983) and subsequent studies by Soon et al. (2008) revealed that brain activity predictive of a decision can occur before a person becomes aware of deciding. The readiness potential appears ~350ms before conscious awareness; fMRI studies extended this to seconds. Importantly, Schurger et al. (2012) challenged the standard interpretation, arguing the readiness potential may be neural noise rather than decision preparation—but even if this critique succeeds, retrocausality offers a more fundamental resolution.

This seems to pose a problem: if the neural activity comes first, isn't consciousness merely informed of decisions already made? Doesn't this reduce consciousness to an epiphenomenon—a passenger rather than a driver?

The retrocausal response: temporal precedence does not establish causal priority. If effects can precede causes, then consciousness occurring "after" neural activity is no obstacle to consciousness being the cause. This response requires accepting an interpretation of quantum mechanics that includes retrocausality—a coherent option, but not the mainstream one.

## Retrocausality in Physics

Retrocausality has serious proponents and empirical grounding in physics.

**Time-symmetric equations**: Quantum mechanics' fundamental equations work equally well forward or backward. The apparent "arrow of time" in measurement is an addition to the formalism. As Huw Price argues, if physics is time-symmetric and causal, retrocausality follows necessarily. See [[collapse-and-time]] for how collapse introduces temporal asymmetry.

**Wheeler's delayed-choice**: Experiments confirm that measurement choices made *after* a particle passes through a double-slit can determine whether it behaved as wave or particle *earlier*. The 2017 satellite experiment extended this over thousands of kilometres.

**The transactional interpretation**: Cramer's interpretation (1986) makes retrocausality explicit. Quantum events involve offer waves propagating forward, confirmation waves propagating backward, and an atemporal "handshake" that creates the transaction. The wave function is physically real; collapse occurs along the entire transaction simultaneously. This interpretation remains a minority view—critics including Tim Maudlin have argued it faces difficulties with specific experimental setups, and Ruth Kastner has developed a modified version (the possibilist transactional interpretation) attempting to address these concerns. The debate continues, but the interpretation provides a coherent framework in which retrocausality is built into physics.

**Bell tests**: Retrocausal models offer an alternative to nonlocality for explaining entanglement correlations—later measurements retroactively influence earlier states, preserving locality at the cost of temporal direction.

## Application to Consciousness

The Map's [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] and [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenets propose that consciousness selects among superposed neural states. If this selection operates retrocausally—as would be natural on the transactional interpretation—then:

1. The brain prepares multiple possible action patterns (superposition)
2. Consciousness "selects" which pattern becomes actual
3. This selection propagates backward, determining which neural history becomes real
4. The readiness potential is part of the selected package, not a prior cause

The [[quantum-indeterminacy-free-will|systematic treatment of quantum indeterminacy and free will]] develops this in detail.

### The Atemporal Selection Model

On the transactional interpretation, if consciousness operates at the level of the quantum handshake, asking "when does consciousness make the decision?" may be the wrong question. The decision isn't made *at* a time; it determines *which* times become real. See [[collapse-and-time]] for the implications. This model requires accepting both the transactional interpretation and the claim that consciousness interfaces with quantum transactions—a coherent package, though each element is contested.

### Addressing Objections

**Can we change history?** No—retrocausality doesn't imply altering established facts. The handshake creates a consistent transaction; the retrocausal influence is part of how the one real history came to be.

**Isn't this unfalsifiable?** All quantum interpretations (Copenhagen, Many-Worlds, Bohmian) make identical predictions for currently testable scenarios. The question is which makes best sense of what we observe. This cuts both ways: retrocausality cannot be empirically established, but neither can it be empirically refuted by appealing to interpretations that deny it.

**Why consciousness specifically?** The claim isn't that consciousness *adds* retrocausal powers but that physics already includes retrocausality, and consciousness operates at the level where this matters.

## Connection to Quantum Consciousness Mechanisms

Retrocausality complements [[quantum-consciousness|quantum consciousness mechanisms]] like Orch OR and Stapp's quantum Zeno. These explain *where* consciousness interfaces with quantum processes; retrocausality explains *how* the temporal ordering puzzle dissolves. Both benefit because consciousness need not "speed up" to precede neural preparation—the collapse and its preparation form an atemporal transaction.

### Motor Selection: Independent Corroboration

The retrocausal framework gains support from [[motor-selection|motor control research]]. Willed movement shows the same neural signatures as willed attention—frontal theta oscillations, ~300ms deployment time. Two independent domains showing identical selection architecture suggests the framework captures something real.

The Libet challenge to motor control has also weakened: Sjöberg (2024) showed that surgical resection of the supplementary motor area doesn't impair voluntary action. The readiness potential may be preparation for execution, not the decision itself.

## The Decoherence Challenge

How do retrocausal influences propagate through systems that have undergone [[decoherence]]? Three considerations: (1) Decoherence timescales are disputed—Hameroff's group obtained coherence times seven orders of magnitude longer than Tegmark's calculations. (2) Retrocausality operates at measurement, not during coherence—the transaction requires boundary conditions at both temporal ends, not sustained superposition. (3) Biological quantum effects like avian magnetoreception prove evolution can exploit coherence.

The transactional picture is subtle: the handshake is atemporal. Decoherence establishes which basis states are available; retrocausality determines which becomes actual.

## The Illusionist Challenge

[[illusionism|Illusionists]] argue retrocausality solves a non-problem: if phenomenal experience is representational fiction, nothing is threatened by Libet. But the regress problem applies—an illusion must appear to something. Even illusionist "seemings" face the temporal ordering puzzle. And the functional asymmetry remains: voluntary actions differ from reflexes, and whatever generates this difference must interface with neural preparation. See [[introspection]] for why phenomenological data survives debunking attempts.

## Contemplative Evidence

[[witness-consciousness|Meditation traditions]] report experiences bearing on retrocausality. Advanced meditators describe awareness standing "outside" temporal flow, observing rather than being carried along. This provides phenomenological support for the atemporal selection model—the witness doesn't experience itself as "before" or "after" its objects.

The phenomenology of decision also supports retrocausality: deliberation involves weighing options, then one option "crystallizing" into actuality. This crystallization feels like genuine selection, not passive observation. Retrocausality vindicates this—the selection *is* genuine, determining the entire transaction including its temporal preparation.

## Time Ontology and Retrocausality

The transactional interpretation requires confirmation waves from the future—but if the future doesn't exist yet (presentism), what sends them? This seems to favour eternalism. Yet the Map requires real collapse, introducing genuine temporal asymmetry. See [[philosophy-of-time]] for the full treatment.

The Map's [[time-collapse-and-agency|temporal framework]] proposes a **modified growing block**: retrocausality operates within time-symmetric physics *before* collapse establishes temporal direction. The "future" participating in transactions is the space of quantum possibilities, not ontologically existing future facts. Collapse—including consciousness-mediated selection—determines which possibilities become the single actual history.

## Presentiment Research

Separate from physics-based retrocausality, parapsychological "presentiment" research claims physiological responses precede randomly selected future stimuli. Meta-analyses report small effects, but skeptics cite replication failures, Bayesian reanalysis showing weak evidence, and biological implausibility. See [[presentiment-and-retrocausality]] for a detailed treatment distinguishing the two lines of inquiry.

The Map grounds retrocausality in physics—the transactional interpretation, Wheeler's delayed-choice, time-symmetric equations—not parapsychology. The mechanism gap matters: neural quantum selection involves quantum events at synapses and ion channels, plausibly interfacing with measurement. Presentiment would require amplifying retrocausality to coordinated responses across millions of cells anticipating external events—a qualitatively larger gap. Even if presentiment were genuine, it concerns *unconscious* anticipation, not *conscious* selection. The Map acknowledges this research as contested while maintaining its physics-based commitments.

## What Would Challenge This View?

The hypothesis would face serious challenge from: (1) experimental falsification distinguishing retrocausal from non-retrocausal interpretations; (2) success of the illusionist program explaining consciousness without genuine selection; (3) alternative Libet resolutions (like Schurger's neural noise interpretation) eliminating the timing puzzle; (4) discovery that consciousness operates entirely through classical computation; or (5) incoherence of the modified growing block time ontology.

None of these currently succeeds, but they mark conditions under which the framework would fail.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Retrocausality connects to all five tenets:

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]**: If consciousness is irreducible to physical processes, its relationship to those processes requires explanation. Retrocausality shows how consciousness can causally influence neural activity even when that activity precedes conscious awareness in the linear temporal sequence. The dualist commitment that consciousness is something over and above the brain gains coherence when the temporal relationship between them is understood retrocausally.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]**: Retrocausality operates specifically at the quantum level—at measurement events where indeterminacy resolves into definite outcomes. The transactional interpretation makes minimal assumptions: physics already contains time-symmetric equations, and retrocausality follows from taking that symmetry seriously. Consciousness doesn't add exotic causal powers; it participates in quantum processes that already have retrocausal structure. This aligns with the tenet's emphasis on the smallest possible interface.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]**: Retrocausality is perhaps most directly relevant here. The Libet experiments seemed to threaten bidirectional interaction by showing neural activity precedes conscious awareness. Retrocausality dissolves this threat completely. Consciousness can genuinely select outcomes even when its awareness appears "after" the neural preparation—because temporal precedence doesn't establish causal priority when effects can precede causes. The brain presents options; consciousness selects; the selection determines which neural history becomes actual, including the apparent "preparation."

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]**: Retrocausality supports single-outcome interpretations. The transactional interpretation produces one actual history, not branching worlds. The handshake between offer and confirmation waves determines which outcome becomes real; there are no equally real alternatives persisting in parallel. This connects to [[haecceity]]: the selected history is *this* history, with haecceitistic identity that branching models cannot capture. You don't merely find yourself in one branch—you *are* one history, selected through the atemporal transaction.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]**: Retrocausality seems exotic from a classical perspective—backward causation offends common-sense intuitions about time. But quantum mechanics already challenged classical intuitions fundamentally. Time-symmetric physics is no more ontologically extravagant than time-asymmetric physics; it just seems unfamiliar. The appearance of simplicity that classical temporal ordering provides may reflect our cognitive limitations, not reality's structure. Occam's Razor cannot adjudicate between interpretations that make identical predictions; and the familiar might not be simpler, only more comfortable.

This doesn't prove the tenets are correct. It shows that a coherent physical picture exists in which:
- Consciousness causally influences the brain
- Neural activity can precede conscious awareness
- These two facts are fully compatible

The Libet experiments don't refute conscious causation—provided one accepts an interpretation of physics that includes retrocausality. On standard interpretations that deny backward causation, the temporal ordering remains problematic. The Map's position is that retrocausal interpretations are sufficiently well-developed and physically motivated that the Libet objection is not decisive. Whether retrocausality is actually true remains an open question in physics; the point is that a coherent option exists under which conscious causation survives Libet intact.
