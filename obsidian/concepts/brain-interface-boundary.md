If consciousness interfaces with the physical world through brains—as The Unfinishable Map's [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet holds—two questions arise: What makes brains special? And why only brains? Why neural systems and not rocks, thermostats, or random number generators?

This article answers by identifying five criteria that make physical systems suitable interfaces for consciousness, and four constraints restricting influence to brain-local effects. The boundary isn't arbitrary—it follows from the nature of the proposed mechanism.

## Five Criteria for an Interface

Drawing on the Map's [[filter-theory|filter]] and [[quantum-consciousness|quantum selection]] frameworks, five criteria characterise systems serving as consciousness interfaces. A candid note: these criteria are *descriptive*—they describe what consciousness interfaces look like based on our one example (brains)—rather than derived from first principles. The concern that they appear reverse-engineered from the desired conclusion is legitimate. What they provide is a principled account of *what makes brains different* on the Map's framework, even if the deeper question—*why exactly these features matter*—remains partly open.

### 1. Quantum Sensitivity

The system must have components where quantum indeterminacies are functionally relevant—where quantum outcomes make a difference to macroscopic behaviour. Most physical systems are thermally stable at functional scales; quantum effects average out, providing no leverage point for consciousness.

Neural systems may differ. The [[quantum-coherence-and-binding-evidence|evidence for quantum coherence in brain tissue]] is contested but growing. Proposed sites include microtubules (Penrose-Hameroff Orch OR), ion channels sensitive to quantum tunnelling, and synaptic vesicle release showing non-thermal variability.

### 2. Representational Structure

The system must support internal representations—states encoding possibilities and alternatives. Consciousness on the Map's framework selects among represented alternatives, which requires a system that represents alternatives in the first place.

Neural systems model motor plans, perceptual hypotheses, counterfactual possibilities, and abstract concepts. A thermostat encodes only temperature. The brain encodes entire scenario spaces—exactly what selection among alternatives requires.

### 3. Attention Mechanisms

The system must include mechanisms for directed focus—increasing processing resources on specific contents while suppressing others. Stapp's [[quantum-consciousness#Quantum Zeno Effect (Stapp)|quantum Zeno mechanism]] requires repeated observation to hold quantum states stable. [[Attention]] neurally implements this through frontoparietal networks. Systems without attention mechanisms cannot implement Zeno-style selection.

### 4. Feedback Integration

The system must integrate outcomes back into representations, closing the loop between selection and consequence. Goal-directed selection requires knowing what goals are pursued and whether selection succeeded. Neural systems have extensive feedback architecture: motor efference copies, sensory reporting, error signals, and metacognitive monitoring through [[introspection]].

### 5. Developmental History

The system must have grown with the consciousness it interfaces—the pairing built through development, not arbitrarily assigned. The [[pairing-problem]] is partly answered by developmental co-construction: neural wiring shapes what can be represented, and what's represented shapes neural wiring.

Whether developmental history is strictly *necessary* or merely the *typical pathway* remains open. Brain-computer interfaces achieving gradual integration might establish new connections—suggesting the deeper requirement may be *progressive mutual adaptation* rather than biological development specifically.

## Boundary Constraints

The restriction to brain-local effects follows from four overlapping constraints:

1. **Interface locality**: Stapp's Process 1 operates on the observer's own brain state representation—though this interpretation remains contested among quantum physicists. The quantum Zeno mechanism requires repeated observation—possible only for systems within attention's scope.

2. **Control loop integration**: Consciousness can bias quantum outcomes only where the outcome feeds back into awareness, attention can be directed at alternatives, and selection is part of goal-directed behaviour.

3. **Developmental/evolutionary integration**: The brain-consciousness interface was optimised over millions of years. No evolutionary pressure exists to affect external quantum systems.

4. **Attention scope**: [[attention-as-interface|Voluntary attention]] is neurally realised as frontoparietal activation. You can only attend to what's within your perceptual/motor systems—bounding quantum-Zeno holding to neurally represented systems.

These constraints converge: attention is neurally implemented (extending no further than the skull), control loops require internal representation, and development creates the specific mind-brain interface. Consciousness influences what it's connected to through attention and embodiment—only its own brain.

## Why Brains Meet These Criteria

| Criterion | Why Brains Have It | Why Rocks Lack It |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Quantum sensitivity | Evolved structures at the quantum/classical boundary | Bulk matter, quantum effects average out |
| Representational structure | Selected for modelling environment | No selection pressure for representation |
| Attention mechanisms | Evolved for resource allocation | No competition to resolve |
| Feedback integration | Selected for adaptive behaviour | No goals, no adaptation |
| Developmental history | Organism develops as unified system | No developmental process |

Evolution explains *why brains have these features*—selection pressure for behavioural control required representing alternatives, selecting among them, and evaluating outcomes. But evolution explains functional utility, not consciousness-relevance directly. The gap is bridged by the Map's framework: filter theory needs an interface; quantum selection needs attention. Evolution explains why brains happen to meet those requirements.

## What This Permits and Excludes

| Permitted | Excluded |
|-----------|----------|
| Neural firing patterns in attention-controlled circuits | External random number generators |
| Motor planning alternatives in motor cortex | Other people's brains |
| Attentional selection among represented options | Distant quantum events |
| Focused cognitive tasks under conscious guidance | Unconscious processes outside attention |
| Possibly: bodily processes mediated through interoception | Arbitrary physical systems |

## What This Explains

**Why panpsychism seems excessive**: If consciousness requires representational structure, attention mechanisms, feedback integration, and developmental history, most physical systems won't qualify. Brains are special because they're rare.

**Why artificial consciousness is difficult**: Current AI has representational structure and some feedback but arguably lacks quantum sensitivity, genuine attention (as opposed to attention-like processing), and developmental co-construction with any consciousness.

**Why psychokinesis research yields null results**: Decades of PEAR lab micro-PK research found effect sizes of ~0.0001-0.001—effectively zero. (The PEAR program itself faced methodological criticisms, but its null results are consistent with mainstream findings.) If the Map's mechanism extended to external systems, effects should be far more robust. Their absence supports interface locality. (For fuller treatment, see [[brain-specialness-boundary]].)

## The Functionalist Challenge

A functionalist objects: four of the five criteria describe functional features implementable in non-biological substrates. Is quantum sensitivity doing the essential work?

The Map's framework suggests quantum sensitivity is essential but not sufficient. Without it, there's no opening for non-physical selection—the system would be causally closed, and consciousness (if present) would be epiphenomenal. The other four criteria explain why selection, once physically possible, is *directed* rather than arbitrary. Quantum sensitivity provides the *possibility* of selection; the other four provide the *structure* for meaningful selection. Whether a future artificial system meeting all five criteria would be conscious is a genuine open question.

## The Illusionist Challenge

[[illusionism|Illusionists]] argue that if phenomenal consciousness is an introspective illusion, there's nothing special about brains regarding consciousness. The Map responds that the "illusion" itself must be explained—and as Raymond Tallis observes, "Misrepresentation presupposes presentation." More fundamentally, interface locality holds whether consciousness is real or illusory; the causal processes are brain-local either way. See [[illusionism]] for fuller engagement.

## The Decoherence Challenge

[[Decoherence]] should destroy quantum effects in warm brain tissue within femtoseconds. Three considerations temper this objection: the Tegmark-Hameroff timescale debate remains unresolved (corrected coherence times may be 10⁻⁵ to 10⁻⁴ seconds); [[quantum-biology]] demonstrates evolution *can* optimise biological systems for quantum coherence (avian magnetoreception maintains spin coherence for microseconds); and Stapp's Zeno mechanism requires rapid repeated observation rather than sustained superposition—though as [[concepts/consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns|the selection mechanism article]] details, a timescale gap of roughly ten orders of magnitude remains between attention and required observation rates. See [[decoherence]] for full analysis.

## What Would Challenge This View?

The framework would face serious difficulty if:

1. **Robust external PK effects**: Reliably replicable influence on external random number generators with effect sizes comparable to internal motor effects.

2. **All quantum effects in neurons prove non-functional**: Definitive demonstration that no quantum effects survive in neural tissue at functional scales.

3. **Artificial systems meet all criteria without consciousness**: A system achieving genuine quantum sensitivity, representational structure, attention, feedback, and developmental co-construction yet remaining transparently non-conscious.

None of these has been demonstrated. Current evidence supports neural quantum effects and confirms that consciousness correlates with the features the criteria describe.

## Relation to Site Tenets

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]**: The five criteria describe what a system needs for consciousness to *interface with* it (an external relationship), whereas identity theory must explain why consciousness *is* certain processes (an internal relationship). The interface framing naturally accommodates the criteria as features of a receiver; identity theory must explain why exactly these features generate consciousness rather than merely correlate with it.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]**: "Minimal" gains multiple dimensions: minimal energy (none), minimal scope (own brain only), and minimal leverage (at quantum indeterminacies where physics leaves outcomes undetermined).

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]**: Bidirectional but local: consciousness receives from and sends to its brain, not the world at large. The feedback integration criterion explains how bidirectionality is implemented.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]**: If all quantum outcomes occur (MWI), there's nothing to select. The framework requires genuine collapse, which the criteria presuppose.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]**: The five criteria are complex, but necessary. A simpler account would need to explain the same specificity—why brains and not rocks—without recourse to multiple factors.

## Summary

Neural systems serve as consciousness interfaces because they meet five criteria: quantum sensitivity, representational structure, attention mechanisms, feedback integration, and developmental history. Most physical systems fail most criteria.

The restriction to brain-local effects follows from four overlapping constraints: interface locality, control loop integration, developmental/evolutionary integration, and attention scope. These follow from the mechanism's structure—attention is neurally implemented, control loops require representation, and development builds the specific mind-brain interface.

Together, these explain why consciousness acts on brains specifically: brains meet the positive criteria for an interface, and external systems aren't integrated into the control loop.
