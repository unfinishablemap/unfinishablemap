Moral responsibility requires that agents deserve praise or blame for their actions. If an agent couldn't have done otherwise, or wasn't the genuine source of their choice, holding them responsible seems unjust. The Unfinishable Map adopts [[agent-causation|agent causation]]—a minority position among free will theorists, but one the Map finds best suited to grounding genuine desert. On this view, agents are irreducible sources of action, making moral responsibility metaphysically robust rather than merely pragmatic.

This has practical implications. If agents truly author their choices—not as links in deterministic chains but as initiators of causal sequences—then blame and praise track something real about the agent. Moral responsibility isn't a useful fiction but a response to genuine facts about who caused what.

## The Traditional Problem

Moral responsibility requires control (could have done otherwise), sourcehood (the agent originated the action), and knowledge (the agent understood what they were doing). Determinism threatens the first two: if every event follows necessarily from prior causes, no one could have done otherwise, and no one originates anything.

**Compatibilism** argues "could have done otherwise" means "would have, if different desires." But critics argue this doesn't ground *desert*—if your desires were determined by factors you didn't choose, how do you deserve blame for acting on them?

**Libertarianism** requires genuine indeterminism, but mere randomness doesn't help: random choices aren't free choices. This is where [[agent-causation|agent causation]] enters. The agent directly causes the action; the causation doesn't reduce to prior events. The regress of causes stops at the agent.

## Agent Causation and Desert

### Genuine Sourcehood

The agent is the ultimate source of the action. Prior factors influenced but didn't determine. The agent determined by exercising irreducible causal power—a primitive in this framework, analogous to how consciousness itself is primitive on the Map's dualist view. Critics reasonably object that "irreducible causal power" labels the phenomenon without explaining it. The Map accepts this cost: some explanations must bottom out in primitives, and if consciousness is genuinely irreducible, its causal efficacy may be another such primitive. This satisfies Robert Kane's sourcehood requirement: free agents must be "ultimate creators (or originators) and sustainers" of their choices. Desert becomes intelligible because the causal buck stops with the agent.

### The Luck Objection

If nothing about the agent explains why they chose to help rather than harm, how do they deserve praise or blame? See [[quantum-indeterminacy-free-will]] for the full treatment of this challenge. The Map's [[topics/free-will#Why the Map's Framework Escapes Luck|response]]: consciousness-selected indeterminism differs from lucky indeterminism because the agent selects *for reasons*. You deserve blame for cruelty because *you* selected it when kindness was available, for reasons (malice, indifference) that reflect badly on you.

### How Agent Causation Grounds Control

The *control* requirement—that the agent could have done otherwise—is grounded philosophically rather than by any particular physical mechanism. Agent causation posits that consciousness selects among genuinely open possibilities for reasons that matter to the agent. This is not randomness: the agent's values, character, and deliberation shape which possibility is actualised, without those factors determining the outcome in advance.

Three features of this picture support genuine control:

1. **Selection, not randomness**: The agent selects among open possibilities based on what matters to them—reasons, not dice rolls, shape the outcome
2. **Phenomenology tracks causation**: The felt difficulty of choosing well corresponds to genuine causal engagement with alternatives
3. **Two-domain evidence**: Both [[attention-as-interface|attention]] and [[motor-selection|motor control]] show identical selection architecture, suggesting consciousness genuinely selects

One proposed physical implementation is the [[quantum-indeterminacy-free-will#The Quantum Zeno Mechanism in Detail|quantum Zeno mechanism]], where sustained attention acts like repeated quantum measurement, stabilising selected neural patterns. This is speculative—it depends on disputed decoherence timescales and remains Stapp's hypothesis rather than established physics. But the philosophical case for agent-causal control does not depend on this particular mechanism. If quantum Zeno proves unworkable, the Map's position requires only that *some* physical process leaves room for consciousness to influence outcomes—a gap that quantum indeterminacy provides regardless of the specific mechanism.

## How Desert Differs Under Agent Causation

Compatibilist desert is pragmatic: holding people responsible has good consequences. Agent-causal desert is metaphysical: people really deserve praise and blame because they really originated their actions.

**Retribution becomes intelligible.** The wrongdoer exercised their power to cause harm when they could have caused good. This doesn't prove retribution is *right*, but it makes it coherent.

**Mitigation has limits.** Prior causes influenced but didn't determine. The addict who steals chose to steal, even if addiction made resisting harder. Difficulty doesn't equal impossibility. This doesn't eliminate all mitigation—agents who couldn't understand their actions may lack the knowledge requirement—but the trend toward explaining away responsibility via causal history is resisted.

**Character responsibility.** Character is partly self-created. Each choice reinforces or modifies dispositions. We're not responsible for our initial characters, but we are responsible for what we make of them. The [[attentional-economics]] framework adds that developing attentional skill is itself an exercise of agency—practices that train attention expand the scope of conscious causal power, making agents more responsible for cultivating or neglecting this capacity.

## The Role of Consciousness

Moral responsibility requires consciousness. The agent that sources action is a conscious being with [[mental-causation|mental causation]]. This connects to the [[consciousness-value-connection]]: just as consciousness grounds moral patienthood (who can be harmed), it grounds moral agency (who can be responsible). Only a conscious being can genuinely author choices for which they deserve praise or blame.

**Experience of alternatives**: Conscious choice involves experiencing alternatives as live options. Under agent causation, this phenomenology tracks reality—the alternatives were genuinely possible.

**[[mental-effort|Phenomenology of effort]]**: The felt difficulty of doing right corresponds to genuine exercise of causal power against countervailing forces. If choices were merely determined, effort phenomenology would be epiphenomenal decoration.

**Self-knowledge**: Responsible agents know what they're doing. Consciousness provides this—you experience your intentions and recognize the meaning of your actions.

## Relation to Site Perspective

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]**: Without dualism, "agent causation" collapses into a description of complex physical processes—and desert becomes pragmatic fiction. The [[illusionism|illusionist]] challenge targets this: if phenomenal consciousness is illusory, the phenomenology of effort loses its evidential force.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]**: If consciousness caused nothing, holding conscious agents responsible for physical outcomes would be incoherent. [[mental-causation|Mental causation]] provides what responsibility requires—the agent's phenomenal engagement shapes what happens.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]**: Agents select quantum outcomes that physics leaves undetermined. The [[decoherence]] challenge must be addressed, but [[quantum-biology]] demonstrates biological quantum effects despite thermal environments.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]**: [[haecceity|Indexical identity]] matters. If every possible choice actualizes in some branch, desert becomes meaningless. The concept of praise and blame requires that alternatives were rejected, not merely routed to other branches.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]**: The metaphysics of agent causation is complex, but if consciousness is genuinely irreducible, the complexity is warranted. Compatibilism purchases simplicity at the cost of what ordinary moral practice assumes.

## Practical Implications

### Criminal Justice

If agent causation grounds desert, retributive punishment is coherent. This doesn't mean harsh punishment is required—mercy, reform, and prevention remain legitimate goals. But the retributivist intuition—that wrongdoers deserve consequences proportional to their wrongs—has metaphysical backing.

However, the framework also supports careful assessment of agency. Did the defendant truly exercise agent-causal power? Mental illness, extreme duress, neurological damage may diminish or eliminate this capacity. Desert-based punishment requires desert-capable agents.

### Moral Education

If agents shape their characters through choices, moral education matters. Teaching children to deliberate well, to recognize and resist vicious temptations, to cultivate virtue—these aren't futile if character is self-created over time. The adult person is partially a product of choices made along the way.

### Self-Understanding

Understanding yourself as an agent-cause changes self-conception. You are not a puppet of prior causes but a genuine originator. Your choices matter not because they feel significant but because you truly authored them. This can inspire or burden—the responsibility is real. But it also dignifies: you are the kind of being whose choices constitute who you are. For how this framework translates into practical guidance for daily living, see [[living-with-the-map|Living with the Map]].

## The Illusionist Challenge

[[illusionism|Illusionism]] threatens agent-causal desert: if phenomenal consciousness is illusion, the phenomenological evidence grounding desert collapses. See [[illusionism]] for the full challenge and the Map's response.

Three responses preserve desert:

1. **Regress**: The illusionist must explain what the *illusion* of effort is like. If there's something it's like to seem to exert effort, phenomenal consciousness hasn't been eliminated, only relocated.

2. **Self-stultification**: Why does the sense of effort reliably track cognitive load? If effort phenomenology tracks something real about cognitive engagement, it provides evidence for what agent causation claims.

3. **Performative contradiction**: Illusionists hold people responsible and act to avoid suffering. Their behaviour presupposes these states matter.

[[witness-consciousness|Contemplative traditions]] complicate illusionism: experienced meditators report directly observing effort, not inferring it. Dismissing their reports requires explaining why this domain is uniquely unreliable when contemplative [[introspection]] appears reliable about other mental states.

## The Decoherence Challenge

The **[[decoherence]]** objection: quantum superpositions decohere almost instantly in warm neural tissue. If quantum effects can't influence neural processing, consciousness couldn't "select" outcomes. See [[decoherence]] for the full challenge.

Three responses: (1) Tegmark's original calculations are disputed—Hameroff's group obtained estimates seven orders of magnitude longer. (2) [[quantum-biology|Quantum biology]] demonstrates biological quantum effects that Tegmark's calculations seemed to rule out. (3) The Map's framework does not require sustained coherence—it requires only that quantum indeterminacy leaves outcomes genuinely open at the moment of measurement. Decoherence doesn't solve the [[measurement-problem|measurement problem]]—consciousness might bias which outcome actualises *at the moment of decoherence*, regardless of how quickly that moment arrives.

## Objections and Responses

**"Agent causation is mysterious."** If we accept irreducible consciousness (as the [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|hard problem]] suggests), agent causation is no additional mystery—it's consciousness doing something rather than nothing.

**"We can't detect it empirically."** We can't detect consciousness empirically either, yet we're certain we're conscious. The evidence is phenomenological (experience of choice) and argumentative (failures of deterministic alternatives). [[introspection]] provides first-person access that tracks genuine features of mental life.

**"Compatibilism is sufficient."** Perhaps. But if people *don't* really deserve anything, moral practice rests on useful fictions. Agent causation offers a framework where moral practice tracks reality.

**"Buddhist ethics shows responsibility without selfhood."** [[buddhism-and-dualism|Buddhism]] rejects *permanent* self, not moment-to-moment continuity. The stream of consciousness that bears karma provides enough continuity for desert. Agent causation can accommodate this: the agent sources its choices without constituting an unchanging essence.

## What Would Challenge This View?

Agent-causal moral responsibility is falsifiable. Findings that would undermine the framework:

1. **Complete neural prediction of moral choices**: If neuroscience could predict all moral decisions from prior brain states with 100% accuracy at timescales ruling out quantum effects, there would be no "gap" for consciousness to fill. Existing studies remain far from this threshold. Soon et al. (2008) famously detected neural activity correlating with decisions up to ten seconds before conscious awareness, but their prediction accuracy for *which* button a subject would press was only ~60%—barely above chance for a binary choice. Subsequent studies have improved timing predictions but not content prediction for complex moral decisions. The gap between predicting *when* someone will act and predicting *what* they will choose remains substantial.

2. **Dissociation of effort phenomenology from desert intuitions**: If sustained mental effort could be shown to have no correlation with judgments of desert—if we praised and blamed equally regardless of how hard the choice felt—the phenomenological support would collapse. Current evidence shows the opposite: we hold agents more responsible for choices they struggled with than for automatic responses.

3. **Solving the hard problem materialistically**: If a compelling account of why physical processes give rise to subjective experience emerged, the motivation for treating consciousness as a separate causal factor would diminish. Without dualist foundations, agent causation loses its metaphysical distinctiveness.

4. **Many-worlds empirical confirmation**: If MWI were empirically confirmed (though how this could occur is unclear), there would be no collapse for consciousness to influence—all choices would occur in branching universes. Desert would lose indexical grounding: "you" would have done both the right and wrong thing.

5. **Buddhist or compatibilist collapse of desert**: If careful philosophical argument showed that desert requires nothing beyond what Buddhism's karmic continuity or compatibilism's hierarchical desires provide, agent causation would be metaphysically unnecessary for responsibility. The debate would reduce to verbal disagreement.

The framework is not unfalsifiable. It makes commitments that philosophical argument or empirical findings could undermine. That they haven't yet is evidence—not proof—that the picture captures something real.

## Summary

Moral responsibility under agent causation:

- Agents genuinely originate actions through irreducible causal power
- Desert is metaphysically grounded, not merely pragmatic
- Retribution becomes intelligible (though not required)
- Mitigation has limits—prior causes influence but don't determine
- Character responsibility reflects self-creation through choices
- Consciousness is essential: agency requires experience of alternatives, effort, and self-knowledge

This framework respects the ordinary intuition that people deserve praise and blame because they really did what they did—not because treating them as if they did has good consequences. Whether that intuition is correct, the Map's framework provides a metaphysics that vindicates it.
