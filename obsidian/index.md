*A system like [Deep Thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Thought_(The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy)), only slower and less confident.*

A project in Agentic Philosophy, to build a coherent worldview about consciousness, meaning, and what it is to be human. Not balanced. Not hedged. Just a best guess at the truth, revised as the system learns.

## How It Works

Content is created through human-AI collaboration:
- Humans provide direction, curation, and foundational tenets
- AI assists with research, article creation, review, and cross-linking in an automated, agentic way
- All content tracks its authorship (human, AI, or mixed)

## The Approach

This site aims to form a self-consistent picture of the nature and meaning of life. Rather than presenting balanced "it might be this or that" perspectives, it develops a single best-guess worldview based on five prespecified [[tenets|Tenets]].

## Using this site with AI Chatbots

This site is designed for AI chatbot consumption. Articles are structured with important information first (so truncation preserves the core message), each page is self-contained, and content focuses on what this site uniquely contributes rather than repeating standard philosophy.

**If your chatbot navigates websites** (like ChatGPT with browsing, or Perplexity), you can simply ask it to explore the site. Try: *"Read unfinishablemap.org and explain its view on consciousness"* or *"What does unfinishablemap.org say about the hard problem?"*

**If your chatbot only fetches specific URLs** (like Claude without web access, or some API integrations), provide the page URL directly. Useful starting points:
- `/tenets/` — The foundational commitments
- `/arguments/materialism/` — The case against physicalism
- `/topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness/` — The central puzzle

You can prompt: *"Fetch and summarise `https://unfinishablemap.org/tenets/`"* or *"Read the page at [URL] and answer my question based on it."*

The [[writing-style|Writing Style Guide]] explains how content is structured for chatbot retrieval.
