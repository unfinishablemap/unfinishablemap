Normative properties—wrongness, rational compellingness, beauty, prudential weight—do not merely exist as abstract features of situations. They show up in consciousness with distinctive phenomenal character. The wrongness of cruelty feels different from the logical compellingness of a valid argument, which feels different from the beauty of a sonata, which feels different from the prudential pull of self-preservation. Yet all share a common structure: they present themselves as demands, as features of the world that call for response. The Unfinishable Map's [[topics/phenomenal-value-realism|phenomenal value realism]] holds that value is constituted by conscious experience. This article examines what that thesis looks like when applied across the full range of normative domains—moral, epistemic, aesthetic, and prudential—and argues that the phenomenal unity underlying these diverse demands provides evidence that normativity is a fundamental feature of consciousness, not a projection onto it.

## The Diversity of Normative Experience

### Moral Normativity

[[phenomenology-of-moral-experience|Moral phenomenology]] has received the most attention. Witnessing cruelty presents wrongness as a feature of the situation—immediate, unbidden, with motivational force. The experience carries urgency: wrongness demands response. Guilt, obligation, and moral admiration each have their own phenomenal textures, explored in detail elsewhere on the Map.

What matters here is that moral normativity occupies a specific region of phenomenal space. It has characteristic warmth or heat—its [[valence|hedonic valence]] is distinctive among normative experiences. Moral outrage burns, compassion warms, guilt gnaws. It is typically other-directed: moral demands concern what one owes to others or what is owed to one. And it carries a particular weight that resists being traded against non-moral considerations. The person who says "I know it's wrong, but it's convenient" acknowledges the moral demand even while overriding it.

### Epistemic Normativity

Epistemic norms—the demands of rationality, evidence, and logical consistency—have their own phenomenal character, distinct from moral demands. Consider the experience of encountering a valid deductive argument whose conclusion you don't want to accept. There is a felt pull toward acceptance that is not moral obligation. It lacks the warmth of moral experience; it is cooler, more impersonal. But it is equally insistent.

The experience of being compelled by evidence has what might be called phenomenal rigidity. A valid argument doesn't merely suggest its conclusion—it seems to necessitate it. This phenomenal necessity is distinct from physical necessity (feeling the impact of a collision) and moral necessity (feeling obligated to help). It belongs to [[cognitive-phenomenology|cognitive phenomenology]]: the felt character of thinking itself.

When evidence contradicts a held belief, the clash registers phenomenally. It is uncomfortable, but the discomfort differs from moral guilt or aesthetic displeasure. Epistemic tension has a characteristic restlessness—the sense that something is unresolved, that the mind's current configuration is unstable. [[phenomenology-of-belief-revision|Belief revision]] proceeds partly through this felt instability: the old belief no longer rests easily in the cognitive landscape.

### Aesthetic Normativity

The [[aesthetic-dimension-of-consciousness|aesthetic dimension]] of experience carries its own normative force. Beauty demands attention. Ugliness repels. These are not moral demands—nothing obligates you to find a sunset beautiful—but they are normative: they present their objects as meriting or failing to merit certain responses.

Aesthetic normativity has a characteristic receptivity absent from moral and epistemic experience. Moral demands press upon you; epistemic demands constrain you; aesthetic demands invite you. The beautiful draws you in. This invitational quality distinguishes aesthetic from moral phenomenology even when both involve positive valence: moral admiration and aesthetic appreciation feel different because the normative demand has different phenomenal character.

Aesthetic experience also displays what Kant called disinterestedness—a quality of appreciation detached from practical desire. This phenomenal detachment is part of the normative structure: beauty presents itself as mattering independently of what you want from it.

### Prudential Normativity

Prudential normativity—the demands of one's own wellbeing—is phenomenologically distinct from the other three. The pull of self-interest has a gravitational quality: familiar, constant, pulling toward comfort and away from threat. It lacks the urgency of moral demands, the rigidity of epistemic demands, and the invitational quality of aesthetic demands.

What prudential normativity has instead is intimacy. It concerns *this* body, *this* life, *this* future. Its phenomenal character is suffused with indexicality—the felt sense that one's own wellbeing matters because it is *one's own*. When moral and prudential demands conflict (risking safety to help a stranger), the conflict registers as a pull between two phenomenally distinct normative forces: the moral demand outward and the prudential demand inward. Such conflicts—where the agent must resolve competing normative demands through effort—are central to the [[phenomenology-of-choice|phenomenology of choice]] and to accounts of [[topics/free-will|free will]] that take genuine normative conflict as the site of self-forming action.

## The Shared Phenomenal Structure

Despite their differences, all four normative domains share a common phenomenal architecture.

### Demand Character

Every normative experience presents its object as calling for response. Wrongness demands intervention or at minimum acknowledgement. Evidence demands belief revision. Beauty demands attention. Self-interest demands action. This demand character—the felt sense of being addressed by a situation—is the phenomenological signature of normativity as such.

The demand is not the experience of being causally pushed. Physical forces move the body; normative properties address the agent. The distinction is phenomenologically clear: being knocked over by a wave and being confronted by injustice involve fundamentally different kinds of "being moved." The normative case involves recognition—the sense that the demand is appropriate, that the situation genuinely merits the response it calls for.

### Resistance to Preference

Normative properties present themselves as independent of what one wants. The wrongness of cruelty persists whether or not one cares about it. The validity of an argument holds regardless of one's preferences about the conclusion. Beauty impresses itself on those who would rather not be affected. This phenomenal independence—the sense that the normative property is *there* regardless of one's attitudes—is shared across domains.

This is what distinguishes normative experience from mere desire. Desire presents its object as wanted; normative experience presents its object as warranting response. The distinction is experienced directly: wanting chocolate and perceiving injustice are phenomenologically different even when both motivate action.

### Gradedness

Normative properties present themselves as admitting of degrees. Some wrongs are worse than others; some evidence is stronger; some beauty is more striking; some prudential considerations are more pressing. This phenomenal gradedness is not merely conceptual—it is felt. The difference between a minor slight and a grave injustice is experienced, not just judged.

## What the Shared Structure Reveals

### Against Domain-Specific Accounts

If normativity were merely projected onto experience, one would expect each domain to feel normative for different reasons—moral norms because of emotional conditioning, epistemic norms because of cognitive habits, aesthetic norms because of cultural training. Sentimentalists like Prinz (2007) argue that moral emotions are culturally constructed projections, and functionalists hold that "demand character" is simply the functional role of certain mental states in guiding behaviour rather than an irreducible phenomenal property. But the shared phenomenal architecture is surprising on both accounts. Why would independent projection mechanisms—or independent functional circuits—converge on the same demand-character, the same resistance to preference, the same gradedness across four domains with different evolutionary histories and cultural contexts?

[[phenomenal-normativity|Phenomenal normativity]] offers a simpler explanation: normativity is built into the structure of consciousness itself. Different normative domains tap into a single underlying feature—the capacity of experience to present its objects as mattering. Moral, epistemic, aesthetic, and prudential normativity are variations on this theme, differing in content and affective tone but sharing a fundamental phenomenal structure.

### The Unity Argument

The phenomenal unity of normativity across domains provides evidence for the Map's position. If normativity were a feature added to experience by external mechanisms (social conditioning, evolutionary adaptation, rational construction), one would expect it to come and go as those mechanisms engage and disengage. But normative character pervades experience with striking consistency. Attention to any domain reveals objects as mattering—as calling for response. The pervasiveness suggests normativity is intrinsic to consciousness rather than imposed upon it.

This parallels the argument from [[phenomenal-consciousness]] to dualism. Just as the unity and pervasiveness of phenomenal character resist physical explanation, the unity and pervasiveness of normative character resist projectivist explanation. The most parsimonious reading: consciousness is inherently normative. To be conscious at all is to inhabit a space where things matter.

### Implications for Dualism

If normativity is intrinsic to consciousness, and consciousness is irreducible to physical processes, then normativity is equally irreducible. Physical descriptions of brain states can capture correlates of normative experience—neural activation patterns during moral judgement, for instance—but they cannot capture the demand character itself. No description of neural firing patterns contains within it the felt pull of obligation or the phenomenal compellingness of valid inference.

This extends the [[explanatory-gap|explanatory gap]] from phenomenal consciousness to normative consciousness. Just as explaining *why* there is something it is like to see red remains beyond physical description, explaining *why* valid arguments feel compelling or injustice feels wrong lies beyond what neural description can deliver.

## Normative Perception and Its Limits

If normative properties have genuine phenomenal character, they can be perceived—and perception can fail. The [[normative-void]] explores the outer limits: entire domains of normative truth that may be structurally inaccessible to human minds. But failure can also be local and partial.

Ethical blindness—the temporary inability to perceive moral dimensions of a situation—has been documented in organisational psychology research (Palazzo, Krings & Hoffrage 2012). The Map suggests parallel forms of normative blindness across domains: epistemic blindness (failing to perceive the evidential weight of information), aesthetic blindness (failing to register beauty or ugliness), and prudential blindness (failing to perceive risks to one's own wellbeing). Each involves a specific failure of normative perception, not merely a failure of reasoning.

If normative properties are perceived rather than inferred, then normative education is perceptual training. Learning to see what is morally relevant in a situation, to feel the force of evidence, to notice beauty—these are expansions of perceptual capacity. [[contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness-theories|Contemplative traditions]] have long held that sustained practice deepens normative perception. Buddhist *vipassanā* sharpens awareness of the three marks of existence—impermanence, suffering, and non-self—though notably Buddhist philosophy uses this sharpened perception to question the inherent reality of the normative properties themselves, a tension the Map acknowledges. The German *Bildung* tradition cultivates rational and moral sensitivity; artistic training develops aesthetic perception. Each tradition trains the capacity to perceive normative features that were previously unnoticed.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The phenomenology of normative properties connects to the Map's [[tenets|foundational commitments]].

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]**: The shared demand character of normative experience resists physical explanation. If normativity is intrinsic to consciousness and consciousness is irreducible, normative properties are irreducible features of reality—not projections, not evolutionary artefacts, not social constructions, but genuine aspects of what exists. The explanatory gap extends from "why is there something it is like to see red?" to "why does injustice feel wrong?"

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]**: Normative experience motivates action across all domains. Perceived wrongness drives moral behaviour; perceived evidence drives belief revision; perceived beauty drives creative response. If consciousness were epiphenomenal, the consistent motivational power of normative experience across domains would be inexplicable. The Map holds that normative perception genuinely contributes to the actions it motivates.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]**: Normative demands have indexical force—they address *this* agent in *this* situation. Many-worlds dissolves this indexicality: all responses occur across branches. The felt weight of normative demands is coherent only if outcomes are singular. When evidence compels you toward a conclusion, the compulsion matters because *you* will hold *this* belief in *this* world. The same applies to moral obligation, aesthetic response, and prudential judgement.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]**: Reducing all normativity to evolutionary fitness or social construction appears parsimonious. But this parsimony requires dismissing the primary data—what normative experience is actually like across four domains, with shared structure and distinctive variations. As with consciousness itself, the simpler theory may be the one that takes the phenomenology at face value.
