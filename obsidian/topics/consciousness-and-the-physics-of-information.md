Physics has undergone a quiet revolution: information is no longer treated as a description of physical systems but as a constituent of them. From Landauer's demonstration that erasing a bit produces measurable heat to Wheeler's declaration that every physical quantity derives from information-theoretic acts, the physics of information suggests that reality's fundamental currency is not matter or energy but information itself. The Unfinishable Map argues that this revolution has consequences for consciousness that most physicists have not followed to their conclusion. If information is physically fundamental, and if consciousness is the one context in which information is not merely processed but *experienced*, then the hard problem of consciousness is not a puzzle bolted onto physics—it sits at its centre.

## The Informational Turn in Physics

Three developments transformed information from a practical tool into a candidate for physical bedrock.

**Landauer's principle** (1961) established that information is physical. Rolf Landauer showed that erasing one bit of information necessarily dissipates at least *kT* ln 2 of energy as heat, where *k* is Boltzmann's constant and *T* is temperature. This is not an engineering limitation—it is a thermodynamic law. Information processing has irreducible physical costs. If information were merely abstract—a pattern we impose on matter—there would be no reason for its erasure to generate entropy. Landauer's principle means that the universe keeps accounts in bits.

**Wheeler's "it from bit"** (1990) went further. John Archibald Wheeler argued that "every it—every particle, every field of force, even the spacetime continuum itself—derives its function, its meaning, its very existence entirely from binary choices, bits, from the answers to yes-or-no questions." This was not a metaphor. Wheeler grounded it in quantum mechanics: the delayed-choice experiment shows that what kind of phenomenon occurs depends on what measurement the observer chooses to perform. The physical fact is constituted by the informational act. As Wheeler put it: "No phenomenon is a real phenomenon until it is an observed phenomenon."

**Quantum information theory** completed the picture. Beginning in the 1990s with the work of Deutsch, Schumacher, and others, physicists discovered that quantum mechanics is most naturally expressed as a theory of information. Entanglement is an informational resource. Decoherence is information leaking to the environment. The black hole information paradox—whether information falling into a black hole is truly destroyed—became one of physics' central problems precisely because physicists now treat information preservation as a fundamental constraint on physical law.

Together, these developments point toward a striking conclusion: physics is not about stuff with information layered on top. It is about information constrained by physical law.

## The Gap That Information Opens

If information is physically fundamental, an awkward question arises. Information, as physicists use the term, is purely structural—Shannon information measures correlations and distinguishability without reference to meaning or experience. A thermostat processes information. A rock encodes information about the forces that shaped it. Neither is conscious.

Yet consciousness is the one context where information is not merely structural. When a pattern of neural firing carries the experience of seeing red, that information has a qualitative character—something it is like, from the inside—that no structural description captures. The physicist can specify every informational relationship in a brain and still leave unexplained why those relationships are accompanied by experience.

This is the [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|hard problem]], but the informational turn sharpens it. If information is fundamental to physics, and if conscious experience is fundamental to information-as-experienced, then consciousness may not be peripheral to the physical picture. It may be the missing piece that explains what information *is* when it is not merely being processed.

David Chalmers gestured at this possibility in 1996 with his "double-aspect theory of information": information, he suggested, has both a physical aspect (its structural-functional role) and a phenomenal aspect (its experiential character). "Wherever we find information in the physical world," Chalmers wrote, "we find two aspects: a physical aspect corresponding to the physical realization of that information, and a phenomenal aspect corresponding to the way that information is experienced." He explicitly treated the scope of this claim as an open question—whether *all* information or only *some* has phenomenal character remained unresolved.

## Three Positions on Information and Consciousness

The informational turn supports several positions on consciousness, each with distinct commitments.

### Information Physicalism

The mainstream view holds that information is physical and consciousness is a particular kind of information processing. [[integrated-information-theory|Integrated Information Theory]] (IIT) exemplifies this approach: consciousness is identical to integrated information (Φ), and any system with non-zero Φ has some degree of experience. IIT takes phenomenology seriously—its axioms start from the character of experience—but ultimately identifies consciousness with a physical property.

The Map's concern with information physicalism is that it dissolves the hard problem by definitional fiat. If consciousness just *is* integrated information, then asking why integrated information is conscious becomes like asking why water is H₂O—a conceptual confusion. But the analogy fails. We can explain why H₂O behaves as water does. Nobody can explain why Φ-structures are accompanied by experience. The identification papers over the explanatory gap rather than bridging it.

### Information Dualism

Chalmers's double-aspect approach treats information as the bridge between physical and phenomenal—a neutral ground from which both aspects emerge. This avoids identifying consciousness with physical structure while still giving it a place in nature's furniture.

The difficulty is specifying which information has phenomenal character. If all physically realised information has an experiential aspect, the position collapses into panpsychism—thermostats experience, rocks experience, electrons experience. If only some information has phenomenal character, what distinguishes the conscious from the non-conscious? The answer cannot appeal to physical structure alone, or the position reduces back to physicalism. Some additional principle is needed, and Chalmers acknowledged this remains unresolved.

### Information as Interface

The Map proposes a third possibility, consistent with its [[tenets|foundational commitments]]: information is the *interface* between consciousness and the physical world, not the substance of either. On this view, consciousness is genuinely non-physical (Dualism), but it interacts with the physical world through informational channels—specifically, by biasing quantum indeterminacies in neural systems (Minimal Quantum Interaction, Bidirectional Interaction).

Wheeler's participatory framework supports this reading. If physical facts are constituted by informational acts of measurement, and if consciousness participates in measurement (as the [[the-measurement-problem-as-philosophical-problem|philosophical analysis of measurement]] suggests), then consciousness shapes reality through information without being reducible to it. Information is the language in which mind and matter communicate, not a substance that eliminates the distinction between them.

## Landauer's Principle and the Cost of Consciousness

Landauer's principle has a provocative implication for consciousness. If every act of information processing has a thermodynamic cost, and if consciousness involves information processing (which it clearly does, given that conscious experience tracks environmental states and guides behaviour), then consciousness has thermodynamic signatures.

This does not reduce consciousness to thermodynamics. The Map's position is that consciousness is not identical to neural information processing—it operates *through* neural information processing via quantum interaction. But Landauer's principle means that the informational interface between consciousness and the brain is subject to physical constraints. Consciousness cannot process unlimited information for free. The bandwidth of the mind-matter interface is physically bounded.

This may explain why conscious experience is limited in scope. We are aware of a tiny fraction of the information our brains process. If the conscious interface operates through quantum biasing, and if each such biasing event carries thermodynamic cost, then consciousness is naturally bandwidth-limited. The narrowness of attention is not a bug in evolution's design—it may reflect a thermodynamic constraint on how much information can flow across the mind-body boundary.

## The Black Hole Information Paradox as Diagnostic

The black hole information paradox—the conflict between quantum mechanics (which demands information preservation) and general relativity (which suggests information is destroyed at singularities)—reveals how seriously physics now takes information conservation. The resolution, most physicists believe, requires that information is never truly lost, even when matter falls into a black hole.

This commitment has implications for consciousness. If information cannot be destroyed, what happens to the information constituting a conscious experience? This is not the same as asking whether consciousness survives death—the information in a brain is physical information, and the Map holds that consciousness is not identical to that information. But it raises the question of whether the *interface* between consciousness and physical information leaves traces. If consciousness biases quantum outcomes, those biased outcomes carry information about the act of biasing. That information, according to physics' deepest commitments, is never lost.

The Map does not build arguments on this speculation. But it notes that the physics of information conservation sits uneasily with any view that treats consciousness as epiphenomenal—as having no physical effects whatsoever. If consciousness leaves no informational trace, it is invisible to physics. If it does leave a trace, physics demands that trace be conserved. Either consciousness participates in the physical information economy, or it stands entirely outside it.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The physics of information provides the strongest available framework for the Map's [[interactionist-dualism]].

The **Dualism** tenet holds that consciousness is not reducible to physical processes. The informational turn in physics does not contradict this—it reveals that even physics itself may not bottom out in "stuff" but in something more abstract. If the physical world is informational rather than material, the dualism at stake is not between mind and matter but between mind and information-structure. This is a more tractable distinction: information-structure describes *what* without capturing *how it feels*, and consciousness supplies what structure alone cannot.

The **Minimal Quantum Interaction** and **Bidirectional Interaction** tenets gain support from treating information as the interface medium. Quantum measurement is already an informational event—the transition from superposition to definite outcome is the acquisition of a bit. If consciousness participates in measurement, it participates through information. Landauer's principle ensures this participation has physical consequences without requiring energy injection—the thermodynamic cost is paid by the system, not imposed from outside.

The **No Many Worlds** tenet connects directly. Many-worlds avoids collapse by treating all outcomes as real, which means all informational branches persist. The Map insists that one outcome becomes actual—that a definite bit is acquired. Wheeler shared this commitment: his "it from bit" requires that measurement produces a single answer to a yes-or-no question, not a superposition of answers.

**Occam's Razor Has Limits** applies to the widespread assumption that because physics can describe information structurally, the structural description is complete. It may not be. The experiential character of information—why some information is *like something*—may require conceptual resources we do not yet possess.
