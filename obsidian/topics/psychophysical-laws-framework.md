If consciousness is ontologically distinct from physics—as The Unfinishable Map's [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism tenet]] holds—then the relationship between mind and matter requires specification through fundamental laws. These psychophysical laws bridge what physics describes (neurons, fields, particles) and what we experience (pain, colour, intention). Without such laws, dualism remains a bare assertion; with them, it becomes a research program with testable structure.

David Chalmers developed the canonical framework for psychophysical laws, arguing that consciousness requires extending our fundamental ontology just as electromagnetism required new laws beyond mechanics. The Map builds on this framework while emphasizing a critical asymmetry: Chalmers focuses on *upward* laws (which physical states produce which experiences), while the Map's [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet requires *downward* laws (which conscious states select which physical outcomes). This page provides an integrated overview of the framework—what psychophysical laws are, why they're needed, how the upward and downward directions differ, and what challenges any such framework must address. For Chalmers' specific contributions and his 2022 quantum development with McQueen, see [[chalmers-psychophysical-coupling]]; for the foundational concept, see [[psychophysical-laws]].

## The Structure of Psychophysical Laws

Psychophysical laws connect two domains that physical science normally treats separately: the objective domain of measurable physical processes and the subjective domain of phenomenal experience. The structure of such laws mirrors that of physical laws but with distinctive features.

### Supervenience Laws

Supervenience laws specify which physical configurations produce which experiences. They answer the upward question: given these neurons in this state, what (if any) experience accompanies them?

Chalmers' naturalistic dualism accepts such laws as fundamental additions to physics. They're "naturalistic" because they're lawful regularities like other natural laws—no Cartesian souls violating conservation, just additional principles completing our picture. They're "dualist" because they connect ontologically distinct domains rather than reducing one to the other.

Three principles constrain supervenience laws:

**Structural coherence**: The structure of experience maps onto the structure of cognitive processing. Three-dimensional colour space corresponds to three-dimensional wavelength analysis. Temporal flow of experience parallels sequential information processing. This constrains but doesn't exhaust the relationship—inverted spectrum scenarios show structure alone doesn't fix phenomenal quality.

**Organizational invariance**: Functionally identical systems have identical experiences. If you replicate a brain's fine-grained functional organization in different substrate, experience transfers. (The Map is skeptical of this principle—[[haecceity|the particular subject]] may matter beyond abstract pattern.)

**Double-aspect information**: Information has both physical and phenomenal aspects. Where information is processed, some form of experience may be present. This approaches panpsychism through information theory rather than traditional metaphysics.

### Selection Laws (Causal Laws)

Selection laws specify how conscious states influence which physical outcomes become actual. They answer the downward question: given this intention or attention state, how does it affect what happens in the brain?

The Map requires selection laws because the [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet commits to downward causation. Consciousness doesn't merely accompany brain states—it participates in determining which of several physically possible outcomes actually occurs.

Selection laws must specify:

1. **Variables on the mental side**: What aspects of experience map to selection? Attention? Intention? Effort? Valence?
2. **Variables on the physical side**: What physical parameters does consciousness influence? Observation rate? Probability weights? Measurement basis?
3. **Bandwidth constraints**: How much selection can consciousness accomplish per unit time? Research suggests ~10 bits/second—the measured bandwidth of conscious thought. This constraint is significant: it implies consciousness operates at the level of policies and action patterns, not individual quantum events. The tight bandwidth limit actually supports the framework by explaining why mental causation operates through attention allocation rather than micromanaging neural activity.
4. **Scope constraints**: What is *not* selectable? (External systems? Others' brains? Events outside attention?)

The [[psychophysical-coupling]] page develops these requirements in detail.

## The Upward-Downward Asymmetry

A critical asymmetry divides the framework: most philosophical development has focused on upward laws while downward laws remain less developed.

### The Upward Direction

Chalmers' work primarily addresses which physical states yield which experiences. This is the "hard problem" direction: why does *this* brain state feel like *that*? The framework provides constraints (structural coherence, organizational invariance) without resolving the mystery of why there's experience at all.

Upward laws can accommodate epiphenomenalism—the view that experience accompanies physical processes without causally affecting them. Chalmers himself tends toward this position, noting that psychophysical laws needn't run in both directions.

### The Downward Direction

The Map requires more. If consciousness makes a causal difference—if intention affects action, if effort affects outcome—then upward laws alone are incomplete. We need laws specifying how mental states select among physical possibilities.

The [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet locates selection at quantum indeterminacies: consciousness biases which of several quantum-mechanically possible outcomes becomes actual, without violating conservation laws or injecting energy. This is where selection laws operate.

Why the focus on quantum selection? Classical physics is deterministic—there's no room for consciousness to determine outcomes that physics already fixes. Quantum mechanics, by contrast, provides probability distributions without determining specific outcomes. That gap is where selection laws take hold.

## Five Candidate Selection Mechanisms

The [[psychophysical-coupling]] page evaluates five proposals for how mental states might couple to physical parameters. In order of theoretical development:

### Attention as Observation Rate (Stapp)

**Phenomenal variable**: Focus of attention, phenomenology of effort
**Physical variable**: Rate of quantum observations
**Mechanism**: Quantum Zeno effect—rapid observation "freezes" neural patterns

This is the most developed proposal. Stapp connects William James' phenomenology of volitional effort to the quantum Zeno effect: attending to something requires work precisely because it requires maintaining high observation rates against competing alternatives. The coupling is specific: attention → observation frequency → pattern stability.

**Challenge**: Decoherence simulations suggest the Zeno mechanism breaks down faster than neural timescales require.

### Intention as Probability Weighting (Eccles)

**Phenomenal variable**: Volition, the experience of willing
**Physical variable**: Vesicle release probability
**Mechanism**: Quantum tunneling in synaptic transmission

Eccles proposed that intention modulates quantum tunneling probability in neurotransmitter release. The brain prepares action possibilities; consciousness biases which patterns dominate through probability weighting. Libet's experiments provide temporal precedence evidence—intention-related neural activity precedes movement.

**Challenge**: The [[pairing-problem|pairing problem]]—how do immaterial mental states locate specific neural targets?

### Valence as Motivational Force

**Phenomenal variable**: Pleasure/pain, felt goodness/badness
**Physical variable**: Action selection
**Mechanism**: Unspecified

Pain asymbolia—intact pain detection without felt badness or motivational response—suggests phenomenal valence specifically does causal work. But no quantum-level mechanism has been proposed for how felt badness influences action selection.

### Qualia as Basis Selection

**Phenomenal variable**: Specific qualitative character (redness, pitch)
**Physical variable**: Measurement basis in collapse
**Mechanism**: Highly speculative

Perhaps different phenomenal qualities correspond to different measurement bases—consciousness selects *what question to ask* rather than *which answer to get*. This remains conceptual possibility rather than developed theory.

### Unity as Sustained Entanglement

**Phenomenal variable**: Phenomenal unity of consciousness
**Physical variable**: Quantum entanglement
**Mechanism**: Consciousness sustains coherence against decoherence

If phenomenal unity requires quantum entanglement (not merely classical correlation), consciousness might actively maintain coherence. Kerskens and Pérez (2022) reported possible entanglement signatures correlating with conscious state—though the study requires replication.

## The Decoherence Challenge

Any quantum approach to psychophysical laws faces the decoherence objection: warm biological systems should destroy quantum coherence in femtoseconds, far too fast for neural processes operating at millisecond timescales.

Three considerations moderate this concern:

**Disputed timescales**: Tegmark's (2000) calculations remain influential and most physicists accept them. However, Hameroff's group challenged specific assumptions—arguing that Tegmark modelled the wrong physical system (treating microtubules as isolated quantum systems rather than coupled networks) and used unrealistic thermal parameters. Under revised assumptions, they obtained coherence times several orders of magnitude longer. The debate is ongoing; the Map does not claim it is resolved but notes that categorical dismissal of neural quantum effects is premature.

**Biological quantum effects exist**: Avian magnetoreception maintains spin coherence for microseconds in warm tissue. Photosynthesis exploits quantum coherence for energy transfer. Evolution has found ways to harness quantum effects in biology.

**Decoherence doesn't solve the measurement problem**: Even after preferred bases are selected through environmental interaction, something must determine *which* outcome occurs. Physics provides probability distributions; it doesn't explain why *this* particular result actualizes. That gap remains open for consciousness to fill.

The decoherence objection assumes psychophysical laws require sustained macroscopic superposition. But attention-based selection (Stapp) and basis-choice selection require only that consciousness affect which questions get asked and how often—not that it maintain long-lived coherence.

## The Specification Problem

A persistent challenge faces the psychophysical laws framework: what Schaffer calls the "t-shirt problem"—the lack of any known compact systematization of psychophysical correlations. Unlike F=ma or E=mc², no elegant formula captures how mind and matter relate.

Three responses are available:

**Scientific immaturity**: Physics took centuries to achieve its current systematization. Consciousness science is young. The absence of simple laws now doesn't imply their absence in principle.

**Cognitive closure**: Perhaps psychophysical laws involve concepts our minds aren't built to grasp—not because the laws don't exist, but because our evolutionary history didn't require comprehending them. This [[mysterianism|mysterian]] response shifts the problem from metaphysics to epistemology. See [[mysterianism]] for the fuller argument that consciousness may be cognitively closed to human understanding.

**Piecemeal progress**: The framework may never achieve physics-like elegance while still providing testable constraints. Stapp's attention mechanism and Eccles' intention mechanism offer specific predictions even without grand unification.

What's not acceptable: using specification difficulty as license for unfalsifiable speculation. If the framework provides no constraints on which phenomenal properties could influence which physical parameters, it loses scientific status. The existence of developed proposals with testable predictions—even if contested—demonstrates the framework isn't inherently untestable.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The psychophysical laws framework is where the Map's [[tenets]] become theoretically precise.

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]** requires psychophysical laws by definition. If consciousness is ontologically distinct from physics, something must specify how they relate. The framework provides the conceptual structure for that specification.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]** requires downward selection laws, not merely upward supervenience. The Map parts company with Chalmers' epiphenomenalist tendency here—consciousness must causally participate in determining outcomes, not merely accompany them.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]** constrains where selection operates: at quantum indeterminacies, biasing probability distributions without violating conservation. This explains why developed mechanisms (Stapp's, Eccles') work at quantum scales rather than proposing direct mental force on classical systems.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]** means selection laws govern genuine collapse. Consciousness selects what becomes *actually* true, not which branch contains "this" observer. If many-worlds were correct, selection laws would collapse to supervenience laws plus indexical uncertainty.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]** justifies the ontological expansion. Adding fundamental laws seems less parsimonious than physicalism. But a parsimonious theory that ignores robust data isn't genuinely simpler—it's inadequate. If consciousness exists and isn't physical, psychophysical laws are necessary completions of our picture, not optional additions.

The framework transforms abstract tenets into researchable questions: Which phenomenal properties map to selection? Through what mechanisms? With what bandwidth? Subject to what constraints? These questions have structure even where they lack final answers.

## What Would Challenge This View?

The psychophysical laws framework would face serious difficulty if:

1. **The hard problem dissolves.** If neuroscience develops a fully satisfying explanation of why we *believe* we have phenomenal experiences without invoking phenomenal properties—and this explanation doesn't tacitly reintroduce experience—the motivation for psychophysical laws evaporates. Current illusionist proposals face the regress problem (misrepresentation presupposes presentation), but a proposal that genuinely avoided it would challenge the framework.

2. **Quantum mechanisms prove unavailable.** If decoherence in neural tissue is so rapid and complete that no quantum indeterminacy survives at any relevant scale—and no protective mechanism (Fröhlich coherence, nuclear spin isolation) proves viable—the Map's specific account of downward causation loses its physical basis. The conceptual need for selection laws would remain, but implementation would need rethinking.

3. **Many-worlds is confirmed.** If MWI were empirically vindicated and the Born rule derived without collapse, selection laws would lose their target. All outcomes would occur; "selection" would be mere indexical uncertainty. Psychophysical laws would collapse to supervenience laws. How MWI could be empirically confirmed remains unclear, but were it confirmed, the framework would need substantial revision.

4. **Specification remains impossible.** If after decades of further work, no psychophysical law can be formulated with enough precision to generate testable predictions, the framework risks unfalsifiability. The existence of candidate mechanisms (Stapp, Eccles) provides hope, but if these prove untestable in principle, the framework's scientific status weakens.

5. **Phenomenology contradicts the mechanism.** If careful phenomenological investigation reveals that mental effort, attention, and intention have structures incompatible with the proposed quantum coupling—for instance, if attention operates continuously rather than in discrete "observations"—the specific mechanisms would need revision. The phenomenology currently supports the attention-based account, but future investigation could challenge this.
