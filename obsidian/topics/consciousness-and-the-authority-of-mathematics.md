Mathematics commands extraordinary authority over the physical world. The equations of general relativity predict gravitational lensing to ten decimal places. Quantum electrodynamics matches experiment to one part in a trillion. Wherever physics has looked, mathematical structure has been found. Eugene Wigner called this the "unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences"—unreasonable because nothing in our understanding of mathematics explains why nature should obey it so precisely.

The Unfinishable Map asks where this authority ends. If consciousness is not reducible to physical processes—as the Map's [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism tenet]] holds—then there is at least one feature of reality that may lie beyond mathematics' jurisdiction. The question is not whether mathematics is useful for studying consciousness (it clearly is, in neuroscience and information theory), but whether mathematical description can capture what consciousness *is*. The Map argues it cannot, and that this failure reveals something important about both mathematics and consciousness.

## The Prestige of Mathematical Physics

Mathematics earns its authority empirically. Dirac's equation predicted antimatter before any experiment confirmed it. Maxwell's equations unified electricity and magnetism, then predicted electromagnetic waves. The Higgs boson emerged from the mathematics of gauge symmetry decades before CERN detected it. Mathematical physics does not merely describe what we observe—it tells us what we *should* observe, and nature complies.

This track record generates a powerful presumption: if something is real, mathematics should be able to describe it. Physicalism—the view that everything real is physical—draws much of its appeal from this presumption. Physics is mathematical, mathematics is extraordinarily successful, and so a fully mathematical account of reality seems achievable in principle. Consciousness, on this view, will eventually submit to mathematical treatment just as electromagnetism and gravity did.

The presumption is understandable but not self-evidently correct. Mathematics describes *structure*—relations between elements, patterns of transformation, symmetries and invariances. The question is whether consciousness is exhausted by its structural features or whether it has aspects that structure cannot capture.

## The Structural Limitation

Consider what mathematics does well. It describes how things relate to each other: masses attract in proportion to their product, charges create fields that fall off with distance squared, wave functions evolve according to the Schrödinger equation. All of these are structural claims—they specify relations, not intrinsic natures.

Bertrand Russell noticed this in *The Analysis of Matter* (1927). Physics tells us about the *structure* of matter—causal relations, spatiotemporal arrangements, mathematical regularities—but nothing about what matter is *in itself*. The equations of physics are "abstract, consisting entirely of structure," leaving the intrinsic nature of physical entities unspecified. Russell concluded that the "world of physics is only *abstractly* known."

This structural character is precisely what makes mathematics so effective. By stripping away everything except relational structure, mathematics achieves universal applicability. The same differential equation governs heat diffusion, population growth, and stock price fluctuations. But this universality comes at a cost: mathematics captures what things do, not what they are.

Consciousness seems to involve what things are. The redness of red, the painfulness of pain, the felt quality of understanding a mathematical proof—these are not relational properties. They are intrinsic features of experience. You can specify every structural relation in which a colour experience participates (its causes, effects, functional role, neural correlates) and still leave out the redness. This is the [[explanatory-gap]] restated in mathematical terms: the gap is between structural description and intrinsic quality.

## Wigner's Question Reversed

Wigner asked why mathematics is so effective in physics. The Map asks the reverse: why is mathematics so *ineffective* at capturing consciousness?

Three candidate explanations:

**Temporary difficulty.** Consciousness is structurally complex, and we simply haven't found the right mathematical framework yet. Integrated Information Theory (IIT) attempts to mathematise consciousness through the quantity Φ (phi), measuring integrated information. This approach treats consciousness as structure—specifically, as a mathematical property of causal systems. If IIT succeeds, mathematical authority extends to consciousness.

**Category error.** Mathematical description is the wrong *kind* of tool for consciousness. Trying to capture the redness of red with equations is like trying to weigh a joke. The failure is not one of precision but of applicability. Mathematics describes structure; consciousness is not a structure but a quality. No refinement of mathematical tools will help because the target is not mathematical.

**Cognitive closure.** Perhaps a mathematical account of consciousness exists but human minds cannot access it. Colin McGinn's [[mysterianism]] suggests that our cognitive architecture may systematically prevent us from understanding the mind-body relation—not because no explanation exists but because the explanation lies beyond our conceptual reach. The mathematical tools might exist in some abstract sense while remaining permanently unavailable to us.

The Map finds the second explanation most compelling, while taking the third seriously. If consciousness is irreducible to physical structure, then mathematics—which describes structure—lacks the resources to capture it. This is not a limitation of current mathematics but a principled boundary.

## Mathematical Consciousness Research in Practice

Mathematics illuminates aspects of consciousness without capturing its essence. The distinction matters.

Neuroscience uses mathematics to model neural correlates of consciousness: firing rates, network topology, information flow between brain regions. This mathematics describes the physical side of the mind-body relation—the structure of the neural systems that consciousness accompanies or interacts with. The mathematics is effective because it targets physical structure, not consciousness itself.

IIT provides the most ambitious mathematical framework for consciousness. Giulio Tononi's formalism defines consciousness as identical to integrated information—a mathematical quantity computable (in principle) from a system's causal structure. The theory's mathematical precision is genuine: Φ is well-defined, consciousness is held to be identical to a particular geometric structure in "qualia space."

But IIT faces a foundational question: does Φ describe consciousness or describe something that happens to correlate with consciousness? The mathematical formalism specifies structural relationships between states of a system. If consciousness is intrinsic quality rather than structure, then however precisely Φ is defined, it measures the structure, not the quality. IIT's mathematical precision may be the precision of the wrong category—a meticulous measurement of something adjacent to what we want to explain.

Global Workspace Theory uses mathematical models of information broadcasting. Higher-Order Theories formalise metarepresentational structures. Each captures something real about consciousness—its functional role, its information-processing aspects, its relation to attention and access. None captures what it is like.

## The Galilean Precedent

Galileo's revolution consisted partly in deciding that mathematics would describe nature and that qualities excluded from mathematical description would be treated as subjective projections. Colour, warmth, taste, sound-as-experienced—the "secondary qualities"—were banished from physics. What remained were the "primary qualities": extension, motion, shape, number. These are precisely the qualities mathematics handles well.

This methodological decision was spectacularly productive. But it has a cost that becomes visible when consciousness is the target. The strategy was: remove subjective qualities from the picture, describe what remains mathematically, and call the result objective reality. When the question is "what are subjective qualities?", this strategy faces a circle. Subjective qualities were excluded *in order to* make mathematical description work. Expecting mathematical description to then explain the excluded qualities confuses a methodological choice with a metaphysical discovery.

Galileo did not prove that secondary qualities are unreal. He assumed they were not part of physics and found that physics worked magnificently without them. This tells us that mathematical physics can ignore consciousness while describing physical structure. It does not tell us that consciousness is nothing beyond physical structure.

## Authority Without Sovereignty

The Map proposes a distinction between mathematical *authority* and mathematical *sovereignty*. Mathematics has authority over structure—wherever structural relationships exist, mathematics describes them, often with stunning precision. But authority over structure does not entail sovereignty over all of reality. If reality includes non-structural features—intrinsic qualities, phenomenal properties, the what-it-is-like of experience—mathematics governs the structural aspect while remaining silent on the rest.

This is not anti-mathematical mysticism. It is a recognition that tools have domains. A microscope has extraordinary authority over the small but no sovereignty over the large. Mathematics has extraordinary authority over structure but need not have sovereignty over quality. The [[mathematical-void]] documents how even *within* mathematics, formal manipulation can proceed without genuine comprehension—we can prove theorems about structures we cannot intuit. The gap between mathematical formalism and understanding appears within mathematics itself. When the target is consciousness—the very phenomenon that constitutes understanding—the gap may be unbridgeable in principle.

Mathematics' authority also matters *for* the Map's framework. The [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet proposes that consciousness biases quantum indeterminacies. This claim is partially mathematical: it concerns probabilities, collapse dynamics, and conservation laws. Mathematics constrains how consciousness could interact with physics even if it cannot describe what consciousness is. The authority holds where structure is at stake—and interaction is structural even if the interacting parties are not exhaustively structural.

## What Would Challenge This View?

The claim that consciousness lies beyond mathematical authority would be undermined by:

**A mathematical theory that predicts qualia.** If a mathematical framework could derive, from structural premises alone, that certain systems will have specific phenomenal qualities—not merely that they will *behave as if* they do, but that redness will be present rather than greenness—this would demonstrate mathematical sovereignty over consciousness. No current theory does this; IIT specifies structural correlates of consciousness without deriving phenomenal quality from structure.

**Discovery that "intrinsic nature" is incoherent.** If the very notion of non-structural, non-relational properties could be shown to be philosophically confused—that every property is ultimately relational—then the structural limitation would dissolve. Ontic structural realism pursues this line, arguing that structure is all there is. If correct, mathematics' authority over structure would be authority over everything.

**Phenomenal qualities turning out to be structural.** If what we call "redness" or "painfulness" could be shown to be complex structural properties that merely *seem* non-structural due to our limited introspective access, then mathematics could capture them after all. This is effectively the functionalist hypothesis applied to qualia.

The view would be *supported* by:
- Continued failure of mathematical consciousness theories to bridge the explanatory gap despite increasing formal sophistication
- Philosophical arguments demonstrating that structure cannot ground intrinsic quality in principle
- Convergence between independent philosophical traditions on the limits of mathematical description

## Relation to Site Perspective

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]:** The structural limitation of mathematics provides independent support for dualism. If mathematics fully described reality, materialism would be the natural ontology—the physical world is mathematical structure, and nothing more exists. The failure of mathematical description to capture consciousness suggests the physical (structural) is not all there is. Consciousness has features that escape mathematical nets precisely because those features are not structural—they are intrinsic, qualitative, and irreducible.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]:** The Map holds that consciousness biases quantum indeterminacies. This proposal sits interestingly between mathematical authority and its limits. The interaction itself—a bias on probabilities—is mathematically describable. But what *does* the biasing (consciousness) and *why* it biases one way rather than another may not be. Mathematics constrains the interaction without explaining the interactor.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]:** The presumption that mathematics describes all of reality is itself a parsimony claim—why posit anything beyond mathematical structure? But the history of mathematics' success is the history of *structural* success. Extending that success beyond structure is an inductive leap, and one that the explanatory gap makes questionable. The simpler-seeming view (everything is mathematical structure) may be simpler only because it ignores what does not fit.
