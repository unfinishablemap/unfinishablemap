Formal systems — logic and mathematics — possess remarkable authority. Logical laws do not merely describe patterns in reasoning; they *compel*. Mathematical equations do not merely fit data; they predict with extraordinary precision what nature has not yet revealed. The Unfinishable Map argues that both forms of formal authority reach a principled boundary at consciousness. Logic cannot ground its own binding force without a subject who experiences necessity as such. Mathematics cannot capture what consciousness *is* because it describes structure while consciousness involves intrinsic quality. Both observations are two faces of the same limitation: formal systems govern form, and consciousness is not exhausted by form.

## The Compulsion of Logic

When you grasp that if all mammals are warm-blooded and whales are mammals, then whales are warm-blooded, you do not experience this as one option among many. You experience it as something you *must* accept. Modus ponens does not describe a tendency — it says the conclusion *follows*, and denying it while affirming the premises is not merely unusual but *wrong*.

Where does this wrongness come from? Physical laws describe regularities that hold without compelling anyone to acknowledge them. A rock obeys gravity without recognising that it must. Logical necessity is different. It is experienced from inside — a sense of being *bound*, of having no rational alternative. A computer executes modus ponens without experiencing this compulsion. It transitions between states according to its programming. The output matches what logic demands, but the machine does not encounter logic's demand.

The [[cognitive-phenomenology]] debate asks whether thinking has its own "what it's like." The authority of logic provides a strong case that it does. When you grasp a valid deduction, there is a distinctive phenomenal quality — not the warmth of understanding a narrative but the cold clarity of seeing that *this must be so*. This experience has three features: **modality** (you feel not just that the conclusion is true but that it *must be* true), **impersonality** (the validity holds regardless of who reasons), and **[[phenomenal-transparency|transparency]]** (you do not merely believe the conclusion follows — you *see* that it does).

A challenge from dual-process psychology: much valid inference occurs rapidly and automatically, without the felt compulsion described here. System 1 reasoning delivers conclusions without phenomenal effort. But automatic inference *implements* logic without *encountering* its authority — the way a calculator implements arithmetic without grasping mathematical truth. The normative force of logic — the experience of being bound — emerges precisely when we step back and ask whether the inference is *valid*, an act that requires conscious reflection.

## The Success of Mathematics

Mathematics earns its authority empirically. Dirac's equation predicted antimatter before any experiment confirmed it. Maxwell's equations unified electricity and magnetism, then predicted electromagnetic waves. The Higgs boson emerged from gauge symmetry decades before CERN detected it. Eugene Wigner called this the "unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences" — unreasonable because nothing explains why nature should obey it so precisely.

This track record generates a powerful presumption: if something is real, mathematics should describe it. Physicalism draws much of its appeal from this presumption. Physics is mathematical; mathematics is extraordinarily successful; a fully mathematical account of reality seems achievable in principle.

The presumption is understandable but not self-evidently correct. Mathematics describes *structure* — relations between elements, patterns of transformation, symmetries and invariances. Bertrand Russell noticed this in *The Analysis of Matter* (1927): physics tells us about the structure of matter — causal relations, spatiotemporal arrangements, mathematical regularities — but nothing about what matter is *in itself*. The equations describe abstract structure — causal and spatiotemporal relations — while leaving intrinsic natures unspecified.

## Where Formal Authority Reaches Its Limit

### The Normative Gap

Physical causation operates through efficient causes — one state producing another according to natural law. But logical authority is not efficient causation. The premises do not *cause* the conclusion the way a billiard ball causes another to move. They *entail* it — a relationship that holds timelessly and necessarily. If your transition from premises to conclusion is fully explained by neural causation, the logical relationship between the propositions was explanatorily idle. You would have drawn the same conclusion (or a different one) depending on neural wiring, regardless of whether the argument was valid.

The physicalist may respond that evolution wired our brains to track logical relationships. But this confuses reliable correlation with normative authority. A thermostat reliably tracks temperature without being compelled by thermodynamic laws. Reliable tracking, however sophisticated, is not the same as being bound. The felt authority of logic — the experience of *having no rational alternative* — is a species of [[phenomenal-normativity]] that exists only for subjects who encounter necessity as such.

Wilfrid Sellars's distinction between the "logical space of reasons" and the domain of causal explanation (later sharpened by McDowell into the contrast between "reasons" and "causes") illuminates why logic resists reduction. The claim that modus ponens is culturally constructed is incoherent — any culture that rejected it could not reason at all. The claim that it is an evolutionary adaptation reduces necessity to contingent usefulness. Logic's authority is *presupposed* by any attempt to explain it away. As Thomas Nagel argues in *The Last Word* (1997), logical reasoning claims an autonomy that survives every attempt at external explanation: to challenge reason's authority, one must exercise that very authority.

### The Structural Gap

The Map asks the reverse of Wigner's question: why is mathematics so *ineffective* at capturing consciousness? Three candidate explanations present themselves. **Temporary difficulty**: consciousness is structurally complex and we haven't found the right framework. **Category error**: mathematical description is the wrong *kind* of tool — like trying to weigh a joke. **Cognitive closure**: a mathematical account may exist but human minds cannot access it, per Colin McGinn's [[mysterianism]]. The Map finds the category error most compelling while taking cognitive closure seriously. The distinction matters: cognitive closure implies that an answer of the right kind *exists* but our minds cannot reach it, while category error implies that no answer of the structural kind exists to be found. The Galilean precedent (discussed in the next section) supports category error — consciousness was excluded from mathematical description not by accident but by design.

[[functionalism|Functionalists]] argue phenomenal properties *are* relational — defined by connections to inputs, other states, and outputs. The Map finds this inadequate. The [[conceivability-possibility-inference|conceivability]] of [[philosophical-zombies|zombies]] (functionally identical beings lacking experience) suggests functional structure is not identical to phenomenal quality. The [[knowledge-argument]] — Mary the colour scientist plausibly learns something upon seeing red — indicates complete structural knowledge leaves something out. These arguments establish that the non-structural character of consciousness is not naive assumption but long-standing philosophical challenge.

You can specify every structural relation in which a colour experience participates — its causes, effects, functional role, neural correlates — and still leave out the redness. This is the [[explanatory-gap]].

## The Galilean Precedent

Galileo's revolution partly consisted in what is now called the [[galilean-exclusion]] — deciding that mathematics would describe nature while qualities excluded from mathematical description would be treated as subjective projections. Colour, warmth, taste, sound-as-experienced were banished from physics. What remained — extension, motion, shape, number — are precisely what mathematics handles well.

This strategy was spectacularly productive. But it creates a difficulty when consciousness is the target, because subjective qualities were excluded *in order to* make mathematical description work. A natural objection: did science not recapture secondary qualities? Temperature became mean molecular kinetic energy; colour yields to wavelengths and cone responses. But what was recaptured in each case was the *structural correlate*, not the phenomenal quality. Thermodynamics tells us everything about the physical process producing felt warmth — molecular motion, energy transfer, thermal equilibrium — but the *feeling of warmth* is not molecular kinetic energy.

Consciousness differs because it *is* the experiential side that structural recapture leaves untouched. When we ask about consciousness, the experiential story is the whole question. Consciousness is the phenomenon that remains on the far side of every Galilean exclusion.

## Authority Without Sovereignty

The Map proposes a distinction between formal *authority* and formal *sovereignty*. Logic has authority over valid inference; mathematics has authority over structure. Neither has sovereignty over all of reality if reality includes non-structural, non-formal features — intrinsic qualities, phenomenal properties, the what-it-is-like of experience.

Formal authority also matters *for* the Map's framework. The [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet proposes that consciousness biases quantum indeterminacies. This claim is partly formal: it concerns probabilities, collapse dynamics, and conservation laws. Mathematics constrains how consciousness could interact with physics even if it cannot describe what consciousness is. An apparent tension emerges: if formal systems cannot capture consciousness, how can consciousness interface with the formally described quantum world? The resolution lies in the authority/sovereignty distinction itself. The *interaction* — probability biasing, conservation compliance — is structural, falling squarely within mathematical authority. The *agent* that interacts — consciousness — has an intrinsic nature that formal description does not exhaust. A person's gravitational mass is fully captured by physics, but physics need not capture everything about the person for gravity to apply. Similarly, [[downward-causation|consciousness acts]] on quantum indeterminacies through a structural interface, even though what consciousness *is* exceeds structural description.

Formal systems also face *internal* limits. Gödel's incompleteness theorems (1931) showed that any consistent formal system powerful enough to express arithmetic contains truths it cannot prove. This is not a practical limitation but a structural one — an inherent boundary on what formal methods can accomplish on their own terms. The consciousness case is a more radical instance of the same pattern: formal systems fail not just to prove certain truths about consciousness but to *express* what consciousness is. The [[incompleteness-void]] explores how Gödelian limits and the limits at consciousness may share a common root in the gap between formal manipulation and genuine comprehension.

The [[mathematical-void]] documents how even *within* mathematics, formal manipulation can proceed without genuine comprehension — we can prove theorems about structures we cannot intuit. When the target is consciousness — the phenomenon that constitutes understanding — the gap between formalism and comprehension may be unbridgeable in principle.

## Alternative Frameworks

### Russellian Monism

Russell's observation — that physics gives only structure — led him not to dualism but toward what is now called [[russellian-monism]]. If physics describes structure and consciousness is non-structural, perhaps consciousness is the *intrinsic nature* that structural descriptions leave out. The physical and the phenomenal would be two aspects of a single reality.

The Map prefers dualism for two reasons. The [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet holds that consciousness *causally influences* the physical world by biasing quantum indeterminacies. Russellian monism typically treats consciousness as underlying physical structure, not as a causal agent acting upon it. Second, if consciousness were the intrinsic nature of all physical reality, some form of [[panpsychism]] follows — and the combination problem (how micro-experiences compose into macro-consciousness) is as difficult as the [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|hard problem]] it was meant to solve.

### Mathematical Platonism

Mathematical Platonists hold that mathematical objects have intrinsic properties beyond their structural characterisation. If so, the clean separation between "formal systems = structure" and "consciousness = quality" needs nuance. The Map's response: even granting mathematical Platonism, the intrinsic nature of mathematical objects is nothing like phenomenal consciousness. Whatever makes 7 the particular number it is, it is not *like anything* to be 7. The relevant limitation is not that formal systems lack all intrinsic natures but that they lack the *specific kind* — phenomenal quality, subjective experience, the first-person perspective.

## Relation to Site Perspective

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]:** The twin limitations of formal systems — logic's failure to ground its own authority without consciousness, mathematics' inability to capture intrinsic quality — provide converging support for dualism. If logical necessity is real and mathematical structure does not exhaust reality, then there are features of the world that physical description cannot capture. Consciousness, as the medium through which necessity becomes manifest and quality exists, involves irreducible properties.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]:** Logical authority is not merely recognised — it is *acted upon*. When you draw a valid conclusion, your recognition of necessity influences which belief you form. If this recognition is genuinely conscious, consciousness causally influences belief formation. An epiphenomenal consciousness could experience logical compulsion without that compulsion making any difference — a position that is, as [[self-stultification]] shows, epistemically self-defeating.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]:** The authority/sovereignty distinction directly shapes how the Map conceives consciousness-physics interaction. Mathematics retains full authority over the structural aspects of this interaction — probability distributions, energy conservation, collapse dynamics — while lacking sovereignty over the conscious agent that participates. The interaction must be formally constrained; the interactor need not be formally exhausted.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]:** Physicalism offers a simpler picture: brains compute, and computation is all there is to reasoning and reality. But a theory that reduces logical compulsion to neural habit cannot itself be logically justified. The presumption that mathematics describes all of reality is itself a parsimony claim — one that the explanatory gap makes questionable.
