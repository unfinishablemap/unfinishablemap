The growing block theory of time holds that past and present exist but the future does not yet. Unlike eternalism's frozen four-dimensional block where all moments are equally real, and unlike presentism's razor-thin slice of existence, the growing block accumulates reality as time passes. C.D. Broad introduced this view in 1923, and it has a distinctive virtue for The Unfinishable Map's concerns: it takes consciousness seriously as marking something ontologically significant about the present moment. The growing block is the temporal ontology most naturally aligned with the reality of conscious experience—and consciousness, in turn, may provide the growing block with exactly what it needs to answer its deepest objections.

## Broad's Original Insight

Broad's *Scientific Thought* (1923) proposed that the sum total of existence increases with time. New moments of experience come into being, and once they exist, they remain. Nothing passes out of existence; reality only adds. The present is the leading edge—the boundary where new slices of reality are being constituted.

This contrasts sharply with both competitors. Eternalism (the [[philosophy-of-time|block universe]]) treats all moments as equally real, making "now" merely indexical—like "here" for space. The distinction between past, present, and future becomes perspectival rather than ontological. Presentism makes the opposite move: only the present is real, so the past has been annihilated and the future hasn't been created.

Broad saw the growing block as preserving what matters in each rival view. Like presentism, it treats the present as objectively special—the frontier of reality. Like eternalism, it gives the past genuine existence, solving the truth-maker problem that haunts presentism (what makes "dinosaurs existed" true if dinosaurs no longer exist in any sense?). The past is real; the future is not; the present is where reality expands.

## Why Eternalism Struggles with Consciousness

Eternalism faces a distinctive difficulty when confronting consciousness. If all moments exist equally, then the vivid sense that *this* moment is special—that the present is where experience actually happens—must be explained away. The eternalist says: every time-slice contains observers who believe their moment is "now," just as every spatial location contains observers who believe their position is "here." No moment is objectively present.

But spatial indexicality and temporal indexicality are not symmetric. "Here" doesn't feel ontologically privileged—few people believe their location is metaphysically special. "Now" does feel privileged. Conscious experience seems to *happen*—to have a dynamic, present-tense character that passive existence lacks. The eternalist must either deny this phenomenology or explain it as a universal cognitive error.

The challenge deepens with [[temporal-consciousness|temporal consciousness]]. Experience doesn't consist of frozen snapshots arranged along a timeline. It flows. The [[specious-present]] has [[duration|duration]]—roughly 100 to 750 milliseconds of felt temporal extent. Within this window, change is directly experienced, not inferred from comparison of static states. Husserl's retention-protention structure reveals that each moment of consciousness carries the immediate past and anticipates the near future as intrinsic features, not external relations.

Eternalism can accommodate this by treating temporal experience as the content of time-slices—each slice encodes the *representation* of flow without flow actually occurring. But this makes the most intimate feature of consciousness—its dynamic, present-tense character—a systematic misrepresentation. The hard problem already asks why physical processes should give rise to experience at all. Adding that the experience fundamentally misrepresents reality's temporal character compounds the difficulty.

## Why Presentism Struggles Differently

Presentism takes temporal experience at face value: the present is real, the past is gone, the future hasn't arrived. This matches phenomenology but creates its own problems for consciousness.

If the past doesn't exist, then memory reaches toward nothing. Retention—Husserl's sense of the just-past echoing within present experience—refers to what has vanished entirely. The experienced duration of the specious present becomes puzzling: if only a durationless instant exists, how can experience have temporal extent? Presentists must locate the specious present entirely within the present moment, treating retention as a present-tense representation of what no longer is.

More pressingly, presentism leaves consciousness without a *history*. Personal identity through time requires some continuity between past and present selves. If past moments of consciousness don't exist in any sense, the narrative structure of selfhood becomes a present-tense fiction about nothing. The growing block avoids this: your past conscious states genuinely exist at earlier locations in the block, grounding identity claims in ontological fact.

## The Growing Block's Advantage

The growing block offers consciousness something neither rival provides: a temporal ontology where the present is objectively special *and* the past is real. Your experience of the present as the frontier of reality reflects the actual ontological structure. Your memory refers to genuine past states that still exist. The flow of experience maps onto the actual growth of the block.

This isn't merely a matter of phenomenological comfort. The growing block provides structural resources for understanding consciousness:

**Genuine openness of the future.** Because the future doesn't exist, conscious deliberation and choice engage with real indeterminacy. [[free-will|Free will]] doesn't require overcoming a fixed future (as on eternalism) or operating without a stable past (as on presentism). The agent stands at the leading edge, with accumulated reality behind and genuine possibility ahead.

**Objective present.** The present isn't merely where an observer happens to be located (eternalism's indexical "now"). It's the ontological frontier—where reality is being constituted. If consciousness marks this frontier, its specialness isn't a cognitive error but a reflection of temporal structure.

**Preserved past.** Unlike presentism, the growing block keeps past reality in existence. This grounds personal identity, makes memory truthful, and allows past conscious states to be genuinely connected to present ones.

## The Epistemic Objection

The growing block faces a serious challenge: if past moments exist and contain observers with experiences, how do those past observers know they aren't at the leading edge? Every past time-slice looks, from the inside, exactly like the present. A person in 1923 experienced "now" just as vividly as someone in 2026. The growing block says the 1923 person exists (as past) but isn't at the leading edge. Yet that person has no way to detect this.

David Braddon-Mitchell (2004) pressed this into a formal objection: growing block residents cannot know they are present rather than past. Since past and present observers have identical epistemic access, the growing block makes temporal knowledge impossible. We could all be deep in the block's past, with reality having grown far beyond us.

This is where consciousness becomes not just a beneficiary of the growing block but a potential resource for defending it. If the present is distinguished not merely by being the latest time-slice but by the occurrence of some ontologically distinctive process—like [[collapse-and-time|quantum collapse]]—then present observers have something past observers lack: active collapse, active becoming. The past is settled; the present is where settlement occurs. Consciousness, on the Map's framework, participates in this settlement. If the phenomenology of the present reflects active participation in collapse—the dynamic, forward-driving quality of experience—then present observers have epistemic access past observers don't: not because they represent themselves as present, but because they are actively constituting reality in a way that past (settled) states no longer do.

## The Rate of Passage Problem

A second objection asks: at what rate does the block grow? "One second per second" seems circular. Growth presupposes a meta-time within which growth occurs, generating a regress.

But this objection may assume what it targets. If growth *is* temporal passage rather than something occurring within time, asking for its rate commits a category error—like asking how fast space extends spatially. The growth of the block and the passage of time are the same phenomenon, not one occurring within the other.

Bergson's [[duration|durée]] offers a complementary response. Lived time has no rate because it isn't measured against an external standard. Duration is qualitative, not quantitative. Asking "how fast does time pass?" spatialises time—treats it as movement through a container—which is precisely what the growing block denies. Time doesn't pass through anything. Reality simply accumulates.

## The Map's Modified Growing Block

The Unfinishable Map proposes a specific mechanism for the block's growth: consciousness-involving quantum collapse. Superpositions resolve at the present moment, and this resolution is what "growth" consists in. The past is collapsed, definite structure. The future is uncollapsed possibility. The present is the activity of collapse itself.

This modification addresses both objections simultaneously. The epistemic problem dissolves because the present isn't just the latest time-slice—it's where active collapse occurs. The rate problem dissolves because collapse *constitutes* temporal passage rather than occurring at a rate within pre-existing time.

The modification also explains why the growing block requires consciousness. Without collapse, what distinguishes the leading edge? Physical laws are time-symmetric—they don't mandate a direction of growth. Something must break this symmetry. The Map's answer: consciousness-involving collapse introduces genuine irreversibility, distinguishing the open present from the settled past. The block doesn't grow mechanically; it grows through the constitutive activity of conscious collapse-participation.

This connects to [[process-philosophy|Whitehead's process philosophy]], where "actual occasions" of experience constitute temporal moments through concrescence—the transition from indeterminacy to definiteness. The growing block's leading edge, on both Whitehead's view and the Map's, is experiential through and through.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The growing block connects to all five of the Map's [[tenets]]:

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]**: If consciousness is what makes the present ontologically special—if the leading edge of the growing block is constituted by conscious collapse-participation—then consciousness plays a role that physical processes alone cannot fill. Time-symmetric physics provides no direction of growth. Consciousness introduces the asymmetry that makes the block grow rather than simply exist. This gives dualism a structural role beyond the hard problem: consciousness isn't just qualitatively different from physics but constitutive of temporal structure.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]**: The growing block's leading edge is where quantum superpositions resolve. Consciousness participates in this resolution at the minimal level—biasing otherwise indeterminate outcomes without injecting energy. Growth occurs through the same minimal mechanism the tenet requires.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]**: On the growing block, consciousness doesn't merely observe the present—it constitutes it. This is bidirectional: physical states present options through superposition; consciousness selects among them through collapse. The result is genuine two-way interaction at the ontological frontier.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]**: The growing block requires real collapse. Many-worlds denies collapse—all branches exist, and the block doesn't "grow" because there is no objective present where possibilities narrow to actuality. Without real collapse, the growing block collapses into eternalism across branching worlds. The No Many Worlds tenet preserves the growing block's distinctive feature: genuine accumulation of definite reality.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]**: The growing block is ontologically heavier than presentism (which posits less existing reality) and less parsimonious than eternalism (which avoids a special present). But parsimony may mislead here. The growing block's complexity corresponds to the complexity of temporal experience itself—the open future, the vivid present, the fixed past. Simpler theories achieve parsimony by denying these features rather than explaining them.
