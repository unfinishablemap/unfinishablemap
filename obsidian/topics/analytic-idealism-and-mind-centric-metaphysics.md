If consciousness is fundamental—not something brains produce but something reality includes from the start—how should we build a metaphysics around that conviction? The Unfinishable Map, Bernardo Kastrup's analytic idealism, panpsychism, cosmopsychism, and dual-aspect monism all answer this question differently. They agree that physicalism fails. They disagree about what replaces it. The choice between these mind-centric frameworks turns on three questions: what is matter, how does causation work, and does individual identity survive?

## The Mind-Centric Turn

The [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|hard problem]] has pushed philosophy of mind toward frameworks that take consciousness as primitive rather than emergent. The explanatory gap between neural firing and subjective experience hasn't narrowed in three decades of neuroscience. No physical description, however complete, entails that there is something it is like to undergo the described process.

This creates pressure to start from consciousness rather than trying to reach it from matter. But "start from consciousness" admits multiple interpretations. At one extreme, consciousness is the only thing that exists (idealism). At the other, consciousness is a fundamental but distinct feature of a reality that also contains genuinely physical things (dualism). Between them sit views that try to dissolve the mind-matter distinction altogether (dual-aspect monism, neutral monism) or that distribute mentality throughout matter itself (panpsychism).

Each framework is mind-centric in the sense that it refuses to treat consciousness as derivative. But the differences between them are substantial.

## Analytic Idealism: Mind Is All There Is

Bernardo Kastrup's [[idealism|analytic idealism]] takes the strongest possible position: universal phenomenal consciousness is the sole ontological primitive. Everything reduces to patterns of excitation within this consciousness. What we call "matter" is the extrinsic appearance of mental processes—the way consciousness looks from outside a dissociation boundary.

Individual minds are "dissociated alters" of universal consciousness, analogous to personalities in dissociative identity disorder. The brain doesn't generate consciousness; it is how a localised mental process appears from an external perspective.

**What idealism gains:** The hard problem dissolves. If consciousness is all there is, there's no gap between physical and phenomenal because there's nothing non-mental to bridge from. Parsimony favours one ontological category over two.

**What idealism loses:** Physical realism. If matter is appearance, what constrains experience? Why can't you walk through walls? Kastrup appeals to the intrinsic structure of universal consciousness, but this structure plays the functional role that physical law plays in dualism. The question becomes whether calling it "mental" rather than "physical" is a substantive claim or a relabelling. (For detailed treatment, see [[idealism]].)

## Panpsychism: Mind Goes All the Way Down

[[panpsychism|Panpsychism]] distributes mentality throughout nature. Every physical entity—from electrons to ecosystems—has some form of experience. Consciousness doesn't emerge at a threshold of complexity; it's there from the bottom.

Contemporary panpsychism comes in several varieties. [[russellian-monism|Russellian panpsychism]] (Philip Goff) treats phenomenal properties as the intrinsic nature of physical entities—what physics describes only extrinsically through structure and dynamics. Integrated Information Theory (Giulio Tononi) identifies consciousness with integrated information, implying that any system with non-zero integrated information has some form of experience. The two approaches differ substantially in detail but converge on refusing emergence.

**What panpsychism gains:** It preserves physical realism. Matter exists; it just has an inner experiential aspect. No emergence gap arises because experience was never absent.

**What panpsychism loses:** It faces the [[combination-problem]]. How do the micro-experiences of billions of neurons combine into the unified consciousness you're having right now? This is not merely difficult; it threatens to be as intractable as the hard problem it was meant to replace. If each neuron has its own micro-experience, why would combining neurons produce a single unified experience rather than a population of separate micro-experiences?

## Cosmopsychism: One Mind, Top Down

Cosmopsychism inverts panpsychism's direction. Instead of building up unified consciousness from micro-experiences, it starts with a single cosmic consciousness and derives individual minds as aspects or limitations of the whole. The cosmos itself is conscious; individual minds are partial perspectives on cosmic experience.

This resembles idealism but retains physical structure as genuinely real—the cosmos has both mental and physical properties. Where idealism says matter is mere appearance, cosmopsychism says the physical universe is real but inherently experiential.

**What cosmopsychism gains:** It avoids the combination problem by starting with unity. It preserves physical realism while making consciousness fundamental.

**What cosmopsychism loses:** It faces the *decombination problem*—how does unified cosmic consciousness break into apparently separate individual experiences? This mirrors the challenge Kastrup's dissociation model confronts. And it raises questions about individual significance: if your mind is merely a partial perspective on cosmic consciousness, what grounds your distinct identity and agency?

## Dual-Aspect Monism: Neither Mind Nor Matter

Dual-aspect monism (or neutral monism) holds that reality is fundamentally neither mental nor physical. Mind and matter are two aspects of a single underlying nature—two ways of describing the same thing. Spinoza's substance, Russell's neutral monism, and some interpretations of Pauli and Jung's psychophysical complementarity fall here.

**What dual-aspect monism gains:** Symmetry. Neither mind nor matter is privileged; both are derivative from something deeper. The interaction problem dissolves because mind and matter aren't separate substances trying to connect—they're aspects of one reality.

**What dual-aspect monism loses:** Explanatory power. The "neutral" substrate is defined only negatively—neither mental nor physical—and invoking it to explain mind-matter correlations can look circular. Why does this neutral stuff have both aspects? What is its nature, if not mental and not physical? The framework sometimes substitutes a label for an explanation.

## The Map's Position: Dualist and Mind-Centric

The Map's [[interactionist-dualism|interactionist dualism]] is mind-centric without being idealist. It takes consciousness as irreducible (with idealism, against physicalism) while insisting that physical reality exists distinctly (with common sense, against idealism).

This requires accepting two fundamental categories: consciousness and physical reality. Critics call this ontologically extravagant. The Map's response draws on the [[tenets#^occams-limits|limits of Occam's Razor]]: apparent simplicity may reflect ignorance rather than truth. The history of science shows repeatedly that the simpler theory was wrong—atoms seemed unnecessary until they weren't, curved spacetime seemed extravagant until it explained Mercury's orbit.

What makes the Map's framework distinctively mind-centric is the [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet: consciousness doesn't merely accompany physical processes; it causally influences them. Most mind-centric frameworks either deny interaction (epiphenomenalist panpsychism) or dissolve it (idealism's intra-mental causation). The Map insists on genuine cross-domain causation through quantum-level processes where physics leaves outcomes undetermined.

## Three Diagnostic Questions

The mind-centric frameworks divide cleanly on three questions:

### Does Matter Exist Independently?

- **Idealism**: No. Matter is appearance within consciousness.
- **Panpsychism**: Yes. Matter exists but has intrinsic experiential properties.
- **Cosmopsychism**: Yes. The physical cosmos is real but inherently mental.
- **Dual-aspect monism**: Neither mind nor matter exists independently; both are aspects.
- **The Map**: Yes. Matter exists distinctly from consciousness and interacts with it.

### How Does Causation Work?

- **Idealism**: One portion of consciousness affects another. No cross-domain causation because there's only one domain.
- **Panpsychism**: For Russellian panpsychists, consciousness is what physical causation *is* from the inside—intrinsic nature rather than a passenger. Constitutive panpsychism faces the [[combination-problem]] when explaining how micro-causation yields unified agency.
- **Cosmopsychism**: Top-down from cosmic mind to individual; physical causation is a constraint within cosmic consciousness.
- **Dual-aspect monism**: Correlations between aspects, not causation across them.
- **The Map**: Genuine bidirectional causation between consciousness and physics, at quantum indeterminacies.

### Does Individual Identity Survive?

- **Idealism**: Derivative. Individual minds are dissociated portions of universal consciousness; individuality may be illusory.
- **Panpsychism**: Unclear. If micro-experience is fundamental, what constitutes *your* experience as a unified individual?
- **Cosmopsychism**: Derivative. Individual perspectives are partial views of cosmic consciousness.
- **Dual-aspect monism**: Ambiguous. Individual subjects may be local manifestations of neutral reality.
- **The Map**: Fundamental. The [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]] tenet asserts that indexical identity—*this* conscious being, *this* choice—genuinely matters.

## What's at Stake

The choice among mind-centric metaphysics isn't purely theoretical. It shapes how we understand agency, moral status, and the significance of individual existence.

If idealism or cosmopsychism is right—if individual identity is derivative—then what grounds personal responsibility? Why does *your* suffering matter distinctly from suffering-in-general? Contemplative traditions report experiences of [[witness-consciousness]]—awareness stripped of individual content—which idealists cite as evidence for universal consciousness. But the Map's [[filter-theory]] can accommodate these reports without idealist metaphysics: if the brain constrains rather than generates consciousness, then reducing those constraints in meditation might reveal a less filtered awareness without implying that individuality is ultimately illusory. The Map's insistence on individual significance connects to the [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]] tenet: if every branch of a quantum event is equally real, then your choices don't genuinely select an outcome, and your identity spreads across branches. The Map rejects this. Mind-centric metaphysics needn't dissolve the individual into the cosmic.

Panpsychism preserves individual identity but struggles with unity. If experience is distributed across fundamental particles, the unity of *your* consciousness becomes the mystery. The [[combination-problem]] is not just a technical puzzle; it asks whether unified subjects can exist at all if experience is fundamentally fragmented.

The Map's dualist answer is unfashionable but direct: you are an irreducible conscious being who interacts with a physical world that exists independently of you. Both halves of this claim carry weight. Taking consciousness seriously doesn't require denying matter. Taking matter seriously doesn't require reducing consciousness.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The Map occupies a specific position within the mind-centric landscape: consciousness is fundamental and irreducible ([[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]), it causally influences the physical world ([[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]), and individual conscious identity genuinely matters ([[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]).

Analytic idealism is the Map's closest competitor. Both reject physicalism. Both take consciousness as fundamental. The Map parts ways on physical realism: Kastrup denies independent physical reality while the Map insists on it. This insistence enables genuine cross-domain causation rather than intra-mental rearrangement. Whether this is a strength (preserving the causal significance of choice) or an extravagance (doubling ontology unnecessarily) depends on whether you think the experience of encountering a genuinely other reality—stone resisting foot, gravity pulling body—reflects something metaphysically deep or merely psychologically compelling.

The Map acknowledges that if forced to choose between idealism and physicalism, idealism would be the less wrong option. But the Map believes a third path exists—one that honours both the irreducibility of consciousness and the independent structure of the physical world.
