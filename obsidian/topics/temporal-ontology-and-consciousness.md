The Unfinishable Map argues that positions on time and positions on consciousness are deeply entangled. Choosing eternalism creates pressure toward functionalism or illusionism about temporal experience. Choosing presentism struggles to accommodate consciousness's causal role. The growing block—where past and present exist but the future does not—is, the Map argues, a temporal ontology well-suited to dualist interactionism. These pairings reflect deep structural connections rather than mere coincidence, though the connections are affinities rather than logical necessities—a philosopher can coherently resist any particular pairing at a cost. The metaphysics of time shapes what consciousness can plausibly be, and what consciousness turns out to be shapes which temporal ontology is most viable. Recognising these affinities narrows the philosophical landscape considerably.

## The Three Temporal Ontologies

The [[philosophy-of-time|philosophy of time]] offers three major positions on what exists. **Eternalism** (the block universe) holds that past, present, and future are equally real—time is a fourth spatial-like dimension, and "now" is indexical rather than ontologically privileged. **Presentism** holds that only the present moment exists—the past has vanished, the future hasn't arrived. The **growing block** holds that past and present exist but the future does not yet—reality accumulates as time passes.

Each makes different claims about temporal passage. Eternalism denies it: nothing "flows," and the sense of passage is perspectival. Presentism affirms it but struggles to explain what the present is passing *into*—if the future doesn't exist, there's nothing for the present to become. The growing block locates passage at the frontier where new reality is constituted.

These are not mere technicalities. Each ontology makes temporal experience either central, peripheral, or illusory—and that shapes what consciousness can plausibly be.

## Eternalism and the Consciousness Problem

Eternalism is the default assumption in modern physics. Relativity treats time as a dimension, and the relativity of simultaneity means there is no universal "now." This gives eternalism scientific credibility. But it creates a distinctive problem for consciousness.

If all times are equally real, temporal flow is not a feature of fundamental ontology. The experience of "now" moving from past to future is a subjective overlay on a static four-dimensional structure. This creates pressure—though not a strict logical requirement—toward accounts of consciousness that can accommodate non-veridical temporal phenomenology.

Sophisticated B-theorists have developed nuanced positions here. Prosser argues that temporal experience within a block universe is veridical about local temporal ordering and change while being non-veridical only about the metaphysical status of "passage" itself. Hoerl distinguishes between *feeling that time passes* and time *actually passing*—the former, he argues, doesn't require the latter. On these accounts, eternalism preserves robust temporal phenomenology (we genuinely experience change, ordering, and duration) while denying only that there is an ontologically privileged "now" moving forward.

These positions are more sophisticated than crude illusionism, and the Map takes them seriously. But they still concede a significant point: the most phenomenologically salient feature of temporal experience—the sense of passage, of the present moment being constitutively different from past and future—is, on these accounts, not tracking a real feature of temporal ontology. The experience of *flow* is real as experience but doesn't correspond to anything flowing. For the Map's dualism, which takes phenomenology as evidence about reality's structure rather than as a representational artefact to be explained away, even this refined concession is costly.

The most natural pairing remains eternalism with [[concepts/functionalism|functionalism]] or [[illusionism|illusionism]]. If consciousness is functional—if what matters is the computational pattern, not the substrate—then temporal experience is whatever the neural/computational pattern produces, and its accuracy about time's nature is irrelevant. Illusionism goes further: the seeming of temporal flow is a representational artefact, and there is nothing it is like beyond the functional state that misrepresents stasis as passage.

This pairing is coherent but costly. The cost is Bergson's [[duration|durée]]—the qualitative, interpenetrating, irreducible flow of lived time. If temporal experience is illusory or merely functional, durée is an error. The melody you hear as unified flow is really a sequence of discrete states, each statically existing at its spacetime location, with "flow" injected by the brain's representational machinery. Every moment of experienced passage is a kind of mistake.

The Map regards this cost as too high. Temporal phenomenology is among the most robust features of conscious experience. Building a metaphysics that begins by declaring this phenomenology illusory is like building an epistemology that begins by declaring perception unreliable—technically possible, but it undermines the evidence base for the theory itself.

## Presentism and the Causal Gap

Presentism takes temporal experience at face value: only the present is real, and passage is genuine. This honours the phenomenology. But it creates a different problem for consciousness.

If only the present exists, causation becomes puzzling. Causes precede effects, but on strict presentism the cause no longer exists when the effect occurs. The past exerts no influence because it isn't there. This is already problematic for physics, but it's devastating for consciousness.

Conscious experience depends on temporal integration. The [[specious-present|specious present]]—the experienced duration within which we hear melodies and understand sentences—requires the just-past to be retained within the present. Husserl's retention structure preserves the past note while the current note sounds. But if the past literally doesn't exist, what is being retained? Retention becomes a representation of nothing.

Presentism pairs naturally with epiphenomenalism or with views that treat consciousness as present-moment awareness without causal depth. If consciousness is exhausted by the instantaneous present, its temporal richness must be reconstructive—memory representations masquerading as retained experience. The past note isn't echoing in the present; the brain is creating a present-moment representation *as if* it were echoing. This collapses the distinction between genuine temporal experience and a snapshot that contains the illusion of duration.

For the Map's purposes, presentism also struggles with [[collapse-and-time|collapse and time's arrow]]. If collapse creates irreversibility—if consciousness participates in the transition from quantum superposition to definite outcome—then the collapsed past must exist in some sense. Its definiteness is what distinguishes it from the still-open future. Presentism, by abolishing the past, loses the asymmetry between settled past and open future that makes collapse meaningful.

## The Growing Block's Fit with Dualist Interactionism

The [[growing-block-universe-and-consciousness|growing block]] preserves what the other ontologies sacrifice. The past exists (unlike presentism), so retention and causal inheritance are genuine relations to real things. The future doesn't yet exist (unlike eternalism), so temporal passage and openness are real. The present is the frontier where new reality is constituted.

This ontology pairs naturally with the Map's dualist interactionism:

**Temporal experience is veridical.** The growing block vindicates durée. Flow is real because reality is genuinely accumulating. The past pervades the present because the past exists and causally influences the present. The future is genuinely open because it doesn't yet exist. Conscious experience of temporal passage tracks an ontological feature of reality rather than constructing an illusion.

**Consciousness at the growing edge.** If the present is where new reality is constituted, and if consciousness participates in [[collapse-and-time|collapse]]—the process by which quantum superposition becomes definite outcome—then consciousness operates at the ontological frontier. The growing block requires some mechanism for growth—thermodynamic irreversibility, spontaneous localisation (as in GRW theory), or simply brute temporal passage could all serve. But consciousness-involving collapse offers a distinctive advantage within the Map's framework: it unifies the growth mechanism with the explanation of why consciousness exists at all. Collapse resolves indeterminacy, adding new definite facts to the accumulated block. On this view, consciousness doesn't merely witness the block's growth; it participates in constituting it.

**Causal efficacy is genuine.** Because the past exists and the future is open, consciousness's causal role is straightforward. Past collapsed states constrain present possibilities; consciousness selects among remaining open possibilities; the selection becomes a new definite fact added to the block. The growing block also reframes challenges like the Libet timing experiments, which appear to show neural readiness potentials preceding conscious decisions. If the present is the frontier where outcomes are constituted, the relevant question is not *when* a decision occurs within a pre-existing temporal sequence but *which* temporal sequence becomes actual—a shift that makes the precise timing of conscious awareness less problematic.

**The hard problem deepens productively.** If consciousness participates in constituting temporal structure—if it's part of what makes the block grow—then reducing consciousness to physical processes faces a structural difficulty. Physical processes occur within temporal structure; temporal structure is partly constituted by consciousness; therefore, consciousness cannot be fully explained by the physical processes it helps make possible. This is admittedly a coherence argument rather than a proof: the growing block and dualist interactionism mutually support each other, with each position making the other more plausible. A critic could charge circularity—that the Map assumes dualist interactionism to motivate the growing block, then uses the growing block to argue for dualist interactionism. The Map accepts this structure as characteristic of metaphysical reasoning more broadly: the best metaphysical packages are those whose components reinforce each other, and coherence arguments—while weaker than deductive proofs—are the primary tool available for evaluating competing metaphysical frameworks. The inability to derive one component independently does not undermine the package's overall coherence, any more than the mutual dependence of scientific theory and observation undermines empirical inquiry.

## Why the Pairings Hold

These pairings are not arbitrary philosophical marriages, though neither are they strict logical entailments. They hold because temporal ontology shapes what temporal experience *can plausibly be*, which in turn shapes what consciousness *most naturally is*.

If time is a static block, temporal experience is non-veridical about passage (even if veridical about ordering and change, as sophisticated B-theorists maintain). Functionalism and illusionism accommodate this comfortably—they don't require consciousness to accurately track metaphysical structure. Dualist views that take phenomenology as evidence about reality face greater tension, though some B-theorist dualists accept the cost. The pressure is real but resistible.

If only the present exists, temporal integration is reconstructive, so consciousness must manufacture apparent duration from instantaneous states. This pushes toward deflationary accounts of experience—thin present-moment awareness supplemented by memory representations. Presentist dualists like William Lane Craig resist this pressure, but they must provide an alternative account of how temporal depth arises from an ontology without a persisting past.

If the block grows, temporal experience can be veridical, consciousness can have genuine causal depth, and the phenomenology of passage tracks something real. This is the environment where dualist interactionism finds its most natural home—not the only possible one, but the one requiring the fewest auxiliary commitments.

The affinity also runs in the other direction. If consciousness is irreducible and causally efficacious (as the Map's tenets assert), then the temporal ontology must accommodate real causal powers and genuine temporal phenomenology. Eternalism makes causal powers perspectival. Presentism makes temporal depth reconstructive. The growing block provides the ontological structure that most straightforwardly matches what dualist consciousness requires.

## Objections and Responses

**The relativity objection.** Special relativity's lack of a universal "now" seems to refute the growing block. But the growing block need not identify the growth frontier with a single hyperplane of simultaneity. Collapse events may define local presents that don't require a global simultaneity surface. The relationship between quantum collapse and relativistic spacetime remains an open problem in physics—the growing block is no worse off than any collapse interpretation.

**The "now" problem.** Why is the growing edge *now* rather than at some earlier point? On a static reading, every past moment was once the edge. The growing block's response: the edge is constitutively special. It's not that one slice of the block is labelled "now"—it's that the edge is where indeterminacy resolves into fact. Consciousness marks this edge because consciousness participates in the resolution.

**The simplicity objection.** Eternalism is simpler—one block, no growth, no privileged present. This is where the Map's [[tenets#^occams-limits|fifth tenet]] applies. Simplicity purchased by denying the phenomenology of temporal passage is not genuine economy. A theory that explains everything except the thing we know most directly—our own temporal experience—has a simplicity that hides rather than reveals.

## Relation to Site Perspective

This article's argument—that temporal ontology and consciousness theories are deeply entangled, forming natural pairings—supports all five of the Map's [[tenets]]:

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]**: Taking temporal phenomenology seriously (as dualism does) calls for a temporal ontology that makes experience veridical. The growing block provides this, while eternalism pressures consciousness theories toward illusionism or functionalism—positions in tension with irreducible phenomenal experience.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]**: The growing block's need for a growth mechanism aligns with consciousness's role in collapse. The interaction is minimal—biasing indeterminate outcomes—but ontologically significant: it's what makes the block grow.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]**: The growing block makes causal efficacy genuine rather than perspectival. Consciousness acts at the frontier, selecting outcomes that become permanent additions to accumulated reality. The past constrains; consciousness selects; new facts result.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]**: Many-worlds is naturally allied with eternalism (all branches equally real) and denies collapse. The growing block requires real collapse and a single accumulating reality. Rejecting many-worlds and adopting the growing block are compatible commitments that reinforce the same metaphysical picture—though they are distinct positions, not logical consequences of each other.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]**: The entanglement of temporal and consciousness commitments illustrates exactly how parsimony can mislead. Eternalism looks simpler but achieves simplicity by exiling temporal phenomenology to illusion. The growing block is more complex but accommodates more of what we actually know.
