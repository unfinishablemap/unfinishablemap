Why does one molecule—dopamine—mediate both the anticipation of reward and the initiation of movement? The standard answer treats this as evolutionary convenience: wanting and pursuing typically go together, so coupling them is efficient. The Unfinishable Map proposes a deeper explanation: dopamine serves both functions because attention and motor planning are the same system, and dopamine prepares this unified system for conscious selection rather than performing the selection itself.

The [[attention-motor-quantum-interface]] is where consciousness may select among possibilities, with dopamine setting the conditions for that selection. This article examines what dopamine research reveals about the unified interface hypothesis. The evidence suggests that dopamine does not cause selection but rather prepares the system for selection to occur—marking what matters, setting thresholds, and creating the neural conditions in which conscious choice could operate.

## The Salience Bridge

### From Perception to Action

Dopamine mediates *salience*—the process by which stimuli or internal states gain prominence and capture cognitive and behavioral resources. Research on dopamine-deficient animals reveals a striking dissociation: they remain awake and capable of movement when externally triggered, yet cannot spontaneously attend to salient information, integrate it with prior experience, or initiate appropriate actions. The behavioral profile resembles a system that can execute but cannot select.

This is the salience bridge at work. Dopamine converts neutral stimuli into entities that pull for attention and action:

1. **Perceptual salience**: Something becomes noticeable, worth attending to
2. **Motivational salience**: The noticed thing becomes worth pursuing
3. **Motor salience**: Pursuit translates into movement preparation

If attention and motor planning share neural substrates (the [[motor-selection|premotor theory of attention]]), these are not three separate salience systems but one system viewed from different angles. Dopamine serves all three because there is only one.

### Evidence from Salience Network Connectivity

The salience network—anterior cingulate, ventral anterior insula, amygdala, ventral striatum—shows reduced connectivity after dopamine depletion. This network sits at the intersection of attention, emotion, and action. Its dopamine-dependence supports the unified interface: the same neuromodulator affects the same network because attention, motivation, and motor initiation are integrated functions.

## Threshold Modulation: Where Selection Occurs

### The Threshold Model

A 2023 *Nature Communications* study found that striatal dopamine regulates decision thresholds during action selection. In drift-diffusion models, evidence for competing options accumulates until one crosses threshold. Dopamine modulates how much evidence is required—not which option wins.

This dissociation is critical for understanding the interface:

- **Dopamine sets threshold height**: Lower dopamine → higher threshold → harder to initiate
- **The selection question remains**: What determines which of the competing options crosses threshold?

If dopamine determined selection directly, lowering threshold would produce random faster responses. But amphetamine preferentially speeds responses to previously rewarded options. The threshold effect is selective, favoring marked options—yet the mechanism by which one marked option wins over another is not explained by threshold alone. The Map proposes that this residual selection may be where consciousness operates.

### A Proposed Three-Layer Architecture

The Map proposes a layered architecture to interpret these findings:

| Layer | Function | Dopamine Role |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| Neural computation | Generate competing options | None (preserved in dopamine-deficient animals) |
| Threshold modulation | Determine what level of evidence triggers action | Primary |
| Selection | Determine which option actualizes | None (operates on dopamine-prepared options) |

On this model, consciousness operates at the third layer—selecting among options that dopamine has made selectable. This would satisfy [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]: consciousness doesn't generate options or set thresholds; it only biases which threshold-ready option wins. Critics may argue that the "selection layer" is simply further neural computation—noise, lateral inhibition, and winner-take-all dynamics. The Map's response is that such mechanisms explain *how* selection is implemented but not *why* it is accompanied by phenomenal experience, nor why volitional selection feels different from automatic processing.

## Tonic and Phasic: Two Modes of Preparation

### The Dissociation

Dopamine neurons operate in two modes:

**Tonic**: Slow, irregular baseline activity. Seconds to minutes timescale. Establishes background readiness.

**Phasic**: Rapid bursts encoding reward prediction errors. Sub-second precision. Marks specific events.

The 2024 *Nature* study used optogenetics to selectively disrupt phasic dopamine while preserving tonic levels. Results:

- **Movement**: Required only tonic dopamine
- **Reward-guided motivation**: Required phasic dopamine
- **Learning from reward**: Required phasic dopamine

### Interface Implications

This suggests different roles in the selection interface:

**Tonic dopamine**: Ensures the system is operational. Sets baseline excitability. Without it, no selection can occur—the interface is offline. Parkinson's akinesia reflects this: the selection system has insufficient baseline activation.

**Phasic dopamine**: Marks specific options at specific moments. Creates the salience landscape on which selection operates. The rapid timescale (~100ms bursts) operates within the broader timing window in which motor commitment and willed attention deployment occur.

Consciousness may interact primarily with phasic marking—choosing among options that rapid dopamine bursts have flagged as relevant—while tonic dopamine provides the necessary substrate.

## Why the Same Phenomenology

### The Effort Parallel

Sustaining attention feels effortful. Initiating willed movement feels effortful. The [[mental-effort|phenomenology of effort]] spans both domains.

If attention and motor planning are separate systems, this parallel requires explanation. Why would two independent processes feel the same way?

If attention and motor planning are one system, the parallel is expected. Effort is what conscious engagement with the selection mechanism feels like, whether that selection concerns what to perceive or what to do.

Dopamine's role clarifies this further. The "wanting" phenomenology—the felt pull toward valued options—correlates with dopamine but is experienced across both domains:

- **Attentional wanting**: A salient stimulus pulls attention; resisting this pull requires effort
- **Motor wanting**: A valued action pulls toward execution; resisting this pull requires effort

The same neurotransmitter mediates both because the same system generates both experiences.

### The Learning Primacy Challenge

A 2025 *Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience* review proposes the "learning primacy hypothesis": dopamine's primary function is reinforcement learning that shapes circuit architecture over time, not real-time modulation of selection.

This challenges simple threshold models but remains compatible with the unified interface—indeed, it may strengthen the framework. If dopamine's primary role is shaping the circuits through which selection occurs rather than moment-to-moment threshold modulation, the selection mechanism becomes more clearly separable from dopamine function.

Consider the implications: dopamine-mediated learning determines which options exist, how they compete, and which have been marked as valuable through experience. The selection mechanism then operates on this learned landscape. Far from threatening the interface hypothesis, learning primacy clarifies the division of labor: dopamine builds and maintains the selection apparatus; something else—the Map proposes consciousness—performs the selection.

The 2024 *Nature* study supports this interpretation: movement (selection execution) requires only tonic dopamine, while learning about what to select requires phasic signals. The selection capacity and the learning capacity are dissociable.

## Theta Oscillations: The Timing Substrate

### Dopamine Promotes Prokinetic Rhythms

A 2024 *Brain* study found that both dopamine and deep brain stimulation shorten motor initiation latencies by shifting neural oscillations:

- **Antikinetic**: Beta rhythms (13-35 Hz) dominate when movement is suppressed
- **Prokinetic**: Theta rhythms (4-10 Hz) dominate when movement is facilitated

Both L-DOPA (dopamine restoration) and electrical stimulation produce the beta-to-theta shift. The correlation with movement latency is robust.

### Theta as Selection Window

Frontal theta oscillations mark willed attention (Bengson 2019) and motor preparation. This convergence matters:

1. Theta provides a timing substrate—each 100-250ms cycle could contain selection events
2. Dopamine promotes the theta state
3. Both attention and motor selection occur within theta windows

If consciousness selects through something like the [[stapp-quantum-mind|quantum Zeno mechanism]]—one proposed but speculative model—theta cycles may provide the timing window in which attention "observes" competing neural patterns. Dopamine doesn't perform the observation; it creates the neural conditions (the theta state) in which observation could operate. Other mechanisms for consciousness-brain interaction remain possible; what matters here is that dopamine's role is preparatory rather than selective.

## What Parkinson's Reveals

### The Window into Dysfunction

Parkinson's disease, with its progressive dopamine depletion, provides a window into what the unified interface requires:

**Akinesia**: Difficulty initiating movement. Selection threshold too high; options don't cross.

**Bradykinesia**: Slow movement. Weakened salience marking; reduced drive.

**Freezing of gait**: Mid-stride arrest, resolved by external cues. Internal selection mechanism fails; external triggers bypass it.

**Preserved reflexes**: Automatic movements intact. Only willed action impaired.

The selectivity is telling. Parkinson's doesn't disable movement—it disables willed movement. The motor circuitry works; the selection interface that engages that circuitry is compromised.

### External Cues as Bypass

Parkinson's patients who freeze can step over a visual obstacle or follow a rhythmic cue. Why? External stimuli bypass the impaired selection mechanism.

In the unified interface framework: external cues directly trigger motor representations without requiring conscious selection among competing options. The dopamine-dependent threshold mechanism is circumvented. This explains why automatic movements (which don't require selection) are preserved while volitional movements (which do) are impaired.

## Relation to Site Perspective

### Dualism

The unified interface supports [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]. If dopamine marked options *and* selected among them, the system would be closed. But dopamine's role is preparatory—it creates selectable options without determining the selection. The selector, operating on dopamine-prepared options, may be consciousness.

The phenomenology reinforces this. Why does wanting feel like something? Dopamine correlates with wanting, but correlation doesn't explain phenomenal character. The experience of being drawn toward valued options—the felt pull of salience—is not a neural computation but a conscious state.

### Bidirectional Interaction

If consciousness selects among dopamine-marked options, the [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet is satisfied. Dopamine provides the brain-to-consciousness direction: what's marked as salient becomes available for conscious consideration. Consciousness provides the consciousness-to-brain direction: selection among marked options determines which neural pattern actualizes.

The dopamine-deficient state—"virtually unconscious behaviorally"—shows what happens when the brain-to-consciousness channel fails. Options aren't marked; there's nothing to select among.

### Minimal Quantum Interaction

Dopamine research elegantly illustrates [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]. Consciousness need not:

- Generate motor force (neural computation does that)
- Create motivational drive (dopamine does that)
- Lower selection threshold (dopamine does that)
- Mark options as salient (dopamine does that)

Consciousness only needs to select among options that dopamine has already prepared. The intervention point is minimal: biasing which of several ready-to-fire options actualizes.

### An Honest Limitation

This framework explains *where* consciousness might interact with the brain—at the selection point in the unified attention-motor interface. It does not explain *how* a non-physical consciousness biases physical outcomes. The mechanism by which selection occurs remains as mysterious as consciousness itself.

What dopamine research provides is a candidate locus and a constraint: whatever consciousness does, it operates on options that dopamine has marked and within thresholds that dopamine has set. The interface is located, even if not fully illuminated.
