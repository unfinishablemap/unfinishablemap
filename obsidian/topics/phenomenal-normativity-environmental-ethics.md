If intrinsic value exists only in conscious experience—if pain's badness and pleasure's goodness are built into what those experiences feel like—then environmental ethics cannot ground obligations in ecosystems, species, or landscapes themselves. The Unfinishable Map's [[phenomenal-normativity|phenomenal normativity]] demands that moral weight tracks consciousness, not ecological wholes. Yet this position does not license environmental indifference. It reconfigures environmental ethics around the conscious beings who inhabit, depend on, and appreciate the natural world—yielding obligations that are often more demanding than those of traditional environmentalism.

## The Scope Problem

The [[consciousness-value-connection]] holds that nothing has intrinsic value unless experienced. This creates what the Map's research on [[topics/phenomenal-value-realism|phenomenal value realism]] identifies as the scope problem: if only conscious experience has value, what about forests, rivers, endangered species, and ecosystems?

Three positions dominate environmental philosophy:

**Anthropocentrism** restricts moral consideration to humans. Nature matters only as a resource for human welfare. This is too narrow even for mainstream ethics—few philosophers defend it without qualification.

**Sentientism** extends moral consideration to all beings capable of phenomenal experience. [[animal-consciousness|Conscious animals]] matter morally because they suffer and flourish. Ecosystems matter instrumentally—as habitats sustaining conscious lives.

**Ecocentrism** (including Aldo Leopold's land ethic and Arne Næss's deep ecology) attributes intrinsic value to ecosystems, species, and natural processes independent of any conscious being's experience. A wilderness has value even if no sentient creature ever enters it.

Phenomenal normativity entails sentientism. If [[valence]]—the felt quality of positive and negative experience—constitutes intrinsic goodness and badness, then value tracks wherever valence exists: in humans, in animals with phenomenal consciousness, and nowhere else. An old-growth forest devoid of sentient life would contain no intrinsic value. A coral reef teeming with conscious fish contains enormous value—not in the reef's structure, but in the experiences of the beings within it.

## Against Ecocentrism

Ecocentrism holds that ecosystems possess intrinsic value independent of consciousness. Leopold's famous dictum—"A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community"—locates value in ecological wholes rather than individual experiencers.

Phenomenal normativity rejects this. "Integrity" and "stability" are descriptions of ecological systems, not normative properties. They become normative only when experienced by conscious beings who appreciate ecosystem health or depend on it for their welfare. An ecosystem in equilibrium on a lifeless planet is neither good nor bad—it simply is.

Holmes Rolston III offers ecocentrism's most rigorous defence: natural selection itself generates value through adaptive fit, and this value exists in the organism-environment relationship independent of any conscious experiencer. But Rolston's "adaptive value" is either a description of functional success (in which case it is not normative without a conscious being to whom the function matters) or a genuine normative property (in which case it requires the kind of experiential grounding that phenomenal normativity provides). The ecocentrist owes an account of how normativity enters a system with no experiencer, and neither Leopold nor Rolston supplies one.

The deep ecology tradition responds that this reflects Western philosophical narrowness. Indigenous traditions and Eastern philosophies, they argue, recognise nature's intrinsic worth without requiring a conscious experiencer.

The Map's reply: these traditions recognise something important—that human welfare is not the only value at stake in environmental decisions. But phenomenal normativity offers an alternative account of what they track. When indigenous traditions treat rivers as sacred, the sacredness reflects the river's role in sustaining conscious life, its place in the aesthetic and spiritual experience of communities, and the recognition that other beings depend on it. The phenomenal experience of encountering the river—its beauty, its sustaining power, the felt connection to place—is where the value resides. Some indigenous ontologies genuinely attribute agency and personhood to rivers and mountains in ways that resist this reinterpretation—the Map acknowledges this tension rather than claiming universal compatibility. But where indigenous ecological wisdom tracks the welfare of conscious beings and the experiential dimension of human-nature encounters, phenomenal normativity grounds these insights without requiring that inert matter carry intrinsic value.

## Sentientism's Environmental Demands

Sentientism, far from licensing environmental destruction, generates demanding obligations—often more stringent than anthropocentrism and sometimes more so than ecocentrism in practice.

### The Scale of Animal Consciousness

The [[animal-consciousness|scientific consensus]] on animal consciousness has expanded dramatically. The Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness (2012) affirmed consciousness in mammals and birds. The New York Declaration on Animal Consciousness (2024) extended realistic possibility to all vertebrates and many invertebrates including cephalopods and possibly insects. If these assessments are correct, ecosystems contain vastly more conscious suffering and flourishing than anthropocentric frameworks acknowledge.

Destroying a wetland is not merely losing a "resource" for human recreation. It is destroying the habitat of millions of conscious beings whose experiences carry intrinsic normative weight. Each fish, bird, amphibian, and potentially each insect whose phenomenal experience includes [[valence|positive or negative valence]] has a stake in the ecosystem's survival—not because the ecosystem has value, but because their experiences do.

### Indirect Obligations and Instrumental Value

Ecosystems, species, and biodiversity have enormous instrumental value under sentientism:

**Habitat preservation** sustains the conditions for conscious flourishing across species. Destroying habitat eliminates the possibility of positive experience for the beings who would have lived there.

**Species preservation** matters because species are not mere collections of genes but populations of (often) conscious individuals. Extinction eliminates an entire lineage of phenomenal experience—a distinctive way that consciousness instantiates in the world.

**Biodiversity** supports ecosystem resilience, which in turn sustains the conditions for conscious life. Monocultures and simplified ecosystems are more fragile, threatening the conscious beings who depend on them.

**Climate stability** affects the welfare of billions of conscious beings across species. Climate disruption is not primarily an ecological harm but a consciousness harm—measured in the suffering of displaced, starving, and dying sentient creatures.

These instrumental obligations can be more demanding than ecocentrist obligations. Ecocentrism might accept predation, disease, and natural death as part of the biotic community's integrity. Sentientism takes the suffering involved in these processes seriously, even if it does not always demand intervention.

## The Aesthetic Dimension

[[aesthetic-dimension-of-consciousness|Aesthetic experience]] provides a distinct but often overlooked grounding for environmental obligations. The felt beauty of a mountain landscape, the awe evoked by old-growth forest, the contemplative quality of watching ocean waves—these are phenomenal experiences with intrinsic normative character.

The Map's [[topics/phenomenal-value-realism#The Map's Position: Phenomenal Value Pluralism|phenomenal value pluralism]] recognises aesthetic quality as intrinsically valuable alongside hedonic valence, meaning, agency, and understanding. Environmental destruction eliminates not only habitat for conscious animals but also the conditions for profound aesthetic experience in conscious beings who encounter nature.

This is not ecocentrism—the aesthetic value exists in the experience of the perceiver, not in the landscape itself. Nor is it anthropocentrism in disguise: any conscious being capable of aesthetic experience (and there is reason to think many animals experience something akin to environmental preference, habitat attachment, or sensory satisfaction) has a stake in the preservation of conditions for such experience. The obligations here extend beyond human aesthetic enjoyment to encompass the experiential richness available to all conscious perceivers. Destroying what makes such experiences possible diminishes the field of available value. A world stripped of wilderness contains fewer opportunities for the kind of deep aesthetic experience that carries intrinsic normative weight.

The aesthetic argument also extends to future generations. Even if no currently existing person will ever visit a particular wilderness, its preservation maintains the possibility of aesthetic experience for future conscious beings. Obligations to preserve are partly obligations to keep the sources of value available.

## Moral Humility and the Boundaries of Consciousness

Phenomenal normativity combined with the [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|hard problem]] demands environmental moral humility. We cannot be certain where consciousness ends.

The [[ethics-of-consciousness#Moral Uncertainty: When We Don't Know|graduated confidence framework]] applies: moral consideration should be weighted by confidence in consciousness. For mammals and birds, confidence is high—they share the cortical and thalamic structures associated with consciousness in humans, display flexible behaviour, and exhibit pain responses that are neuroanatomically homologous to ours. For fish and cephalopods, confidence is moderate—they possess nociceptors, show aversive learning, and display behavioural flexibility, but their neural architectures differ substantially. For insects, confidence is low but non-zero—their behavioural complexity sometimes exceeds what reflexive processing would predict. For plants and ecosystems as wholes, near-zero—no known mechanism for unified [[phenomenal-normativity|phenomenal experience]].

This uncertainty creates a practical asymmetry. The cost of treating a conscious being as if it lacks consciousness (ignoring genuine suffering) is far greater than the cost of treating a non-conscious entity as if it might be conscious (unnecessary caution). Environmental policies should err on the side of protecting beings whose consciousness status is uncertain.

The [[phenomenology-of-normative-properties|phenomenology of normative demands]] is relevant here. When confronted with a suffering animal, most people experience a direct normative demand—a felt obligation to help. This [[moral-perception|moral perception]] is evidence that consciousness-grounded normativity is at work. We do not infer that the animal's suffering matters through ethical theory; we perceive its mattering directly. Environmental ethics grounded in phenomenal normativity honours this perceptual evidence rather than explaining it away.

## Practical Implications

Phenomenal normativity generates specific environmental commitments:

**Factory farming is the largest source of preventable conscious suffering on Earth.** Sentientism treats this as a moral emergency, not an externality. The [[why-pain-hurts|inseparability of consciousness and pain]]—the fact that felt awfulness constitutively drives behaviour—means these animals are not merely in states correlated with suffering; they are suffering. Environmental ethics focused on carbon footprints or land use misses the primary harm: billions of conscious beings experiencing lives of sustained negative valence.

**Habitat destruction must be evaluated through its impact on conscious beings,** not solely through biodiversity metrics or ecosystem services. A development that displaces a hundred conscious animals causes moral harm even if ecosystem function is preserved.

**Conservation priorities should weight consciousness.** Protecting habitats rich in conscious life (coral reefs with fish, tropical forests with mammals and birds) is more morally urgent than preserving ecosystems with minimal conscious inhabitants, other things being equal.

**Wild animal suffering deserves moral attention.** If phenomenal normativity makes suffering intrinsically bad regardless of its source, the vast suffering in nature—predation, parasitism, starvation—is a genuine moral concern. The scale is staggering: wild animal suffering likely dwarfs human suffering by orders of magnitude. Sentientism does not require intervention in all wild suffering (the consequences of large-scale intervention are unpredictable, and genuine [[free-will|moral agency]] requires choosing non-intervention through deliberation rather than defaulting to it through inattention), but it does require taking it seriously rather than romanticising nature as inherently good.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The Map's tenets shape environmental ethics distinctively:

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]**: If consciousness is irreducible, the moral status of conscious animals is not contingent on our theoretical frameworks—they genuinely experience suffering and flourishing regardless of how we explain it. This grounds environmental obligations more firmly than functionalist approaches where moral status depends on debatable criteria for consciousness.

**[[tenets#^minimal-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]**: The Map holds that consciousness interfaces with the physical world at the smallest possible scale. For environmental ethics, this tenet is less directly relevant than the others—it constrains the *mechanism* of interaction rather than its *moral significance*. But it does bear on the boundary question: the distribution of consciousness across species depends in part on which organisms possess neural architectures capable of supporting the relevant quantum-level interactions.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]**: Animal consciousness is not epiphenomenal. The suffering of a trapped animal causally shapes its behaviour through [[downward-causation|downward causation]]—it matters *to* the animal, not just as a correlate of neural activity. Environmental destruction that causes animal suffering causes real harm to agents whose experiences influence their actions.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]**: Environmental choices have genuine stakes. The Map rejects many-worlds interpretations, and this rejection preserves the moral urgency of environmental decisions: *this* world, with *these* conscious beings, is the one that matters. (Proponents of MWI argue that decision theory under many-worlds can still ground rational action via branch-weighting, but the Map holds that genuine moral stakes require a single actualised outcome.)

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]**: Dismissing animal consciousness because "mere mechanism" is simpler reflects the kind of false parsimony the Map rejects. The apparent simplicity of denying animal experience ignores what convergent evidence from neuroscience, behaviour, and evolutionary biology suggests.
