Theoretical virtues — the properties that make one theory preferable to another — are the engine of rational theory choice in science. Simplicity, explanatory power, empirical adequacy, fertility, scope, elegance, and unificatory strength normally help scientists navigate between competing hypotheses. The Unfinishable Map argues that consciousness breaks the machinery of theoretical virtues in distinctive and underappreciated ways. Not just parsimony (addressed separately in [[epistemological-limits-of-occams-razor]]), but the entire suite of virtues malfunctions when the target phenomenon is subjective experience. This systematic failure may itself be diagnostic of something about consciousness's nature — though interpreting it requires care, as the article explores.

## The Standard Account of Theoretical Virtues

Philosophers of science identify a family of properties that make theories choice-worthy beyond mere empirical fit. Thomas Kuhn (1977) listed accuracy, consistency, scope, simplicity, and fruitfulness as the values guiding theory selection. Larry Laudan (1984) emphasised problem-solving effectiveness. More recent catalogues include:

- **Empirical adequacy**: the theory saves the phenomena
- **Explanatory power**: the theory makes outcomes intelligible
- **Simplicity/parsimony**: fewer entities, principles, or assumptions
- **Scope**: the theory covers a wide range of phenomena
- **Fertility**: the theory generates new predictions and research directions
- **Elegance**: the theory exhibits formal beauty or naturalness
- **Unificatory strength**: the theory subsumes previously separate domains

These virtues are not decorative preferences. They are epistemically weighted: theories scoring higher on more virtues are rationally preferred, other things being equal (McMullin 2008). The virtues function as *meta-criteria* — they arbitrate when evidence alone does not settle the question.

The critical assumption, rarely made explicit, is that these virtues are *domain-general*. The same criteria that select between rival theories of gravity should select between rival theories of mind. Consciousness exposes this assumption as false.

## Where Each Virtue Breaks Down

### Empirical Adequacy Without Explanation

In most sciences, empirical adequacy is the baseline virtue: a theory must at minimum save the phenomena. For consciousness, this virtue functions in reverse. Physicalist theories can "save" the behavioural and neural phenomena — functional states, neural correlates, reportability — while systematically failing to account for the target explanandum: subjective experience itself.

The problem is not that physicalist theories are empirically inadequate in the standard sense. They predict neural activations, reaction times, and verbal reports with impressive accuracy. The problem is that everything they predict could hold true in a system with no experience at all. A theory that is empirically adequate with respect to third-person data says nothing about whether phenomenal consciousness exists. The [[philosophical-zombies|zombie argument]] exploits precisely this gap: a being behaviourally and functionally identical to a conscious human, yet with no inner life, is consistent with every empirically adequate physicalist theory.

Empirical adequacy thus becomes *insufficient as a discriminator*. Physicalism and property dualism can both accommodate the third-person data. The virtue cannot do its normal work because the phenomenon at issue — what it is like — is not the kind of thing that third-person empirical adequacy captures.

### Explanatory Power and the Explanatory Gap

Explanatory power is typically the most decisive theoretical virtue. The theory that makes phenomena most intelligible wins. But consciousness reveals a circularity at the heart of this virtue. Explanatory power is assessed by whether a theory produces *understanding* — and understanding is a phenomenal state. As [[consciousness-and-the-philosophy-of-explanation]] examines in detail, every major model of scientific explanation (deductive-nomological, causal-mechanical, unificationist) breaks down when applied to consciousness.

For the mind-body problem specifically, the difficulty is starker. Physicalism offers no explanatory connection between neural processes and phenomenal character. It is not that the connection is complicated; it is that we lack any model of what such a connection would even look like. Joseph Levine's [[explanatory-gap]] (1983) identifies this as a structural deficit, not a temporary one. The identity "pain = C-fiber activation" does not explain pain's phenomenal character the way "water = H₂O" explains water's macroscopic properties.

Dualism, by contrast, does not purport to explain *why* consciousness exists — it takes consciousness as fundamental. This is not a refusal to explain so much as a standard theoretical move: physics takes charge, mass, and spacetime as fundamental without explaining why they exist. Taking consciousness as a further fundamental is explanatorily costly but not methodologically unusual. Neither position scores well on standard explanatory power, but they fail for different reasons and in different ways. The virtue cannot arbitrate between them.

### Simplicity Beyond Parsimony

The [[epistemological-limits-of-occams-razor|simplicity problem]] for consciousness extends beyond the parsimony arguments already examined. Even setting aside ontological economy, simplicity as a virtue requires a shared metric for comparing theories. In physics, simplicity can be formalised: fewer free parameters, simpler equations, more compact axiomatic bases. For consciousness, no such metric exists.

What would count as a "simpler" theory of consciousness? Physicalism is ontologically simpler (one substance). Dualism may be explanatorily simpler (fewer brute identities). Panpsychism is structurally simpler (no emergence from the non-experiential). Illusionism is eliminatively simpler (no hard problem at all). Each scores as "simplest" on its own preferred dimension. Without a domain-appropriate simplicity metric — and no one has proposed one — the virtue is underdetermined.

### Scope and the Boundary Problem

A theory's scope — how wide a range of phenomena it covers — normally favours more general theories. Physicalism claims maximal scope: everything is physical, consciousness included. Dualism seems to narrow scope by introducing a separate domain.

But scope is valuable only when genuine coverage is achieved. A theory that *claims* to cover consciousness while providing no explanatory grip on phenomenal character achieves verbal scope, not substantive scope. [[functionalism|Functionalist]] accounts, for instance, offer impressive scope over cognitive and behavioural phenomena while leaving phenomenal character untouched. Saying "consciousness is physical" covers the domain only if something informative follows. When nothing does — when the claim amounts to "consciousness is physical, though we cannot say how" — the scope advantage is nominal.

The scope virtue also assumes phenomena are comparable. A theory covering both gravity and electromagnetism unifies genuinely similar things (forces between objects). A theory covering both protein folding and phenomenal redness unifies things so categorically different that the "coverage" may reflect conceptual stretching rather than genuine theoretical reach.

### Fertility and the Direction of Research

Fertile theories generate productive research programmes. This virtue has been used to defend physicalism: the neural correlates of consciousness programme has produced decades of fruitful investigation, while dualism is sometimes charged with being a "science-stopper."

The charge is partly unfair — dualism generates its own research questions about the interface between mind and matter, the conditions for consciousness, and the [[binding-problem|binding problem]]. But the deeper issue is that fertility as a theoretical virtue presupposes that we know what would count as progress. In consciousness studies, this is exactly what is contested. Neural correlate research is fertile in producing correlations. But if the hard problem is genuine, this fertility does not bring us closer to explaining experience — it maps the physical side of a gap that physical investigation cannot bridge.

A genuinely fertile theory of consciousness would generate research that progressively closes the [[explanatory-gap]] (Lipton 2004 examines this link between fertility and explanatory progress). No current theory does this. Fertility, as applied to consciousness, measures productivity *within* a framework rather than progress *toward* understanding. The virtue cannot distinguish busy-work from breakthrough.

### Elegance and the Aesthetic Trap

Mathematical elegance and formal beauty have guided major discoveries in physics. Dirac's equation, Maxwell's unification, Einstein's field equations — elegant formalisms that turned out to describe nature accurately. Paul Dirac famously declared that "it is more important to have beauty in one's equations than to have them fit experiment."

For consciousness, elegance is a trap. The "elegant" theory — the one that most satisfies the aesthetic sense of unification and formal beauty — varies entirely with the theorist's priors. To a functionalist, the elegant theory is one that integrates consciousness seamlessly into the computational structure of cognition. To a dualist, elegance lies in a clean ontological distinction that respects the manifest difference between the physical and the experiential. To a panpsychist, elegance is a universe where experience is fundamental rather than emergent.

More troublingly, the sense of elegance is itself a [[epistemic-emotions|phenomenal state]] — a species of aesthetic experience. When theorists use elegance as a guide to theories *about* phenomenal experience, the circularity should be evident. The conscious sense of what is beautiful shapes the selection of theories about consciousness. The [[phenomenology-of-theoretical-commitment]] that makes one framework feel elegant is part of the phenomenon under investigation.

### Unificatory Strength and the Unity Trap

The ideal of theoretical unification — bringing diverse phenomena under a single explanatory framework — has driven some of science's greatest advances. But applying this virtue to consciousness produces a characteristic illusion.

Physicalism promises maximal unification: one ontology for everything. This is genuinely attractive. But the unification is achieved by *stipulation* rather than *explanation*. Declaring consciousness physical does not illuminate how the physical gives rise to experience. The unification is syntactic (one category label) rather than semantic (genuine understanding of how the domains connect). Compare Maxwell's unification of electricity and magnetism, where the mathematical framework genuinely showed how the phenomena relate. No comparable framework connects neural processing and phenomenal character.

Dualism sacrifices unificatory scope but gains explanatory honesty. By recognising consciousness as genuinely different from physical processes, it avoids the pseudo-unification that comes from labelling everything "physical" while leaving the deepest question — why there is experience at all — untouched.

## The Systematic Nature of the Failure

The individual failures catalogued above are significant. But the pattern they form matters more. It is not that consciousness poses minor difficulties for one or two theoretical virtues. Every major virtue malfunctions when applied to the mind-body problem. Empirical adequacy cannot discriminate. Explanatory power cannot be assessed. Simplicity lacks a metric. Scope conflates verbal coverage with genuine reach. Fertility measures activity rather than progress. Elegance reflects priors. Unification is syntactic rather than semantic.

This systematic failure admits three interpretations, which are not mutually exclusive — the truth may involve elements of more than one. The first: consciousness is simply harder than other problems, and the virtues will eventually engage once we develop better theories. The second: consciousness is a different *kind* of problem — one that the theoretical virtues, evolved for selecting between competing physical theories, are not equipped to adjudicate. The third, associated with [[mysterianism|mysterian]] philosophers like Colin McGinn, is that human cognitive architecture lacks the conceptual resources to solve the mind-body problem. On this view, the virtues fail not because the answer is non-physical, but because our minds cannot grasp the answer at all.

The Map favours the second interpretation, though the third deserves serious engagement. The "harder problem" reading (interpretation one) offers no explanation for *why* the virtues fail so uniformly — it simply predicts that they will eventually succeed, a promissory note with no expiration date. The mysterian reading (interpretation three) is more formidable: cognitive closure would indeed predict systematic virtue failure, and does so without positing non-physical ontology. The Map's reason for preferring dualism over mysterianism is that cognitive closure is itself a claim about the limits of consciousness — and explaining *why* consciousness cannot grasp its own nature seems to require substantive facts about what consciousness is. Mysterianism, in other words, is an epistemological thesis that presupposes but does not provide an underlying metaphysics. Dualism at least offers a candidate answer: the virtues fail because they are tools calibrated for one ontological domain being applied to another.

A crucial distinction underlies this reasoning. The article's first-order claim — that theoretical virtues cannot adjudicate between physicalism and dualism on the mind-body problem — does not entail that *no* reasoning can bear on the question. What fails is the direct application of virtues developed for choosing between competing physical theories. What remains available is second-order reasoning: asking *why* the virtues fail systematically, and which metaphysical picture best accounts for that failure. This second-order question is not itself an application of the theoretical virtues; it is an inference about the conditions under which domain-specific tools lose their grip.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The Unfinishable Map's fifth tenet — that [[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor has limits]] — is a special case of a broader claim this article develops. Not just simplicity but the entire toolkit of theoretical virtues fails to settle the consciousness debate. The Map interprets this failure as diagnostic: it marks the boundary where physical description ends and a different kind of reality begins.

This connects to the [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]] tenet, though the connection requires the first-order/second-order distinction developed in the preceding section. The article's first-order claim — that theoretical virtues cannot settle the mind-body problem — is neutral between dualism and physicalism. Both camps should accept it. The second-order question is why the virtues fail so systematically. Dualism offers a candidate explanation: physical-domain tools should work for physical-domain questions and lose traction outside their domain. Physicalism must instead treat the failure as temporary — a promissory note that future physical theories will restore the virtues' grip. Neither reading is entailed by the first-order analysis alone. The Map finds the dualist reading more explanatory but acknowledges that mysterianism (cognitive closure) provides a competing second-order account that deserves engagement on its own terms.

The [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet gains support from the circularity identified in several virtues. Explanatory power, elegance, and fertility are assessed through phenomenal states — understanding, aesthetic response, and the felt sense of productive inquiry. If consciousness causally contributes to theory selection (as these virtues require), then the process of choosing between theories of consciousness is not a neutral evaluation. It is an exercise in which consciousness reflexively evaluates theories about itself. This self-reference does not invalidate the inquiry, but it demands more caution than standard theory choice requires.

The Map does not claim that theoretical virtues are useless. In their home domain — selecting between competing physical theories with shared empirical bases — they remain powerful. The claim is that extending them uncritically to the mind-body problem produces the illusion of rational adjudication where genuine adjudication is unavailable. Recognising this is the first step toward intellectual honesty about what the consciousness debate actually requires.
