The Unfinishable Map's commitment to dualism—that consciousness is irreducible to physical processes—was articulated independently in India over two thousand years before Descartes. Three classical Indian schools developed sophisticated philosophies of mind that remain philosophically live: Samkhya, Nyaya, and Vedanta. Each takes consciousness as fundamental, but they disagree sharply on what follows. Samkhya places mind on the *matter* side of the divide. Nyaya treats consciousness as an adventitious quality of a non-physical self. Vedanta dissolves the divide entirely, making consciousness the sole reality. These internal disagreements illuminate problems the Map must face, and the depth of Indian engagement with consciousness offers resources Western philosophy of mind has largely neglected.

For broader cross-cultural context, see [[the-hard-problem-in-non-western-philosophy]] and [[eastern-philosophy-consciousness]].

## Samkhya: Mind as Matter

Samkhya's dualism is more radical than Descartes'. Where Cartesian dualism divides reality into thinking substance (*res cogitans*) and extended substance (*res extensa*), placing mind with consciousness, Samkhya divides it into *purusha* (pure consciousness) and *prakriti* (primordial materiality)—and places mind, intellect, and ego entirely within *prakriti*.

This means all cognitive processing—perception, reasoning, memory, emotion—belongs to the material world. *Buddhi* (intellect), *ahamkara* (ego-sense), and *manas* (coordinating mind) are evolutes of unconscious matter, structured by three constituent qualities (*gunas*): *sattva* (clarity and structure), *rajas* (activity and change), and *tamas* (inertia and obstruction). When *sattva* predominates in the intellect, matter becomes transparent enough to "reflect" *purusha*—but this is reflection, not emergence. Consciousness does not arise from material complexity. It was always present; matter merely ceases to obstruct it. This resonates with the [[filter-theory]]—brains transmit consciousness rather than producing it.

*Purusha* itself is pure witnessing: changeless, partless, and—crucially—inactive. The *Samkhya Karika* (Ishvarakrishna, c. 350 CE) states in verse 19 that *purusha* is a non-doer (*akarta*), a witness (*saksin*), and neutral. Verse 21 offers the famous analogy of the blind and the lame: *prakriti* is like someone who can walk but cannot see (active but unconscious), *purusha* like someone who can see but cannot walk (conscious but inactive). Together they accomplish what neither could alone.

### The Interaction Problem

If *purusha* does nothing, how does unconscious matter evolve purposefully? Samkhya's answers are distinctive. *Purusha* does not act on *prakriti* causally. Its mere *proximity* (*sannidhya*) disturbs *prakriti*'s equilibrium, the way a magnet moves iron filings without physical contact (the tradition's own analogy). Vacaspati Mishra (c. 980 CE) developed a "reflection theory" (*pratibimba-vada*): consciousness is reflected in *buddhi* without entering it, as a face is reflected in a mirror without becoming the mirror.

By placing mind within matter, Samkhya avoids the Cartesian problem of how a non-physical substance could push neurons around. Physical causation handles everything in the material domain, which includes all mental activity. Consciousness illuminates without intervening.

### Plurality and Liberation

Unlike Advaita Vedanta's single universal consciousness, Samkhya holds there are many *purushas*—each individual has a distinct conscious principle. The argument (*Samkhya Karika* 18): different beings have different births, deaths, and experiences; actions are non-simultaneous; these facts require distinct witnesses.

Liberation (*kaivalya*) means isolation—*purusha* recognizing its complete distinction from *prakriti* through discriminative knowledge (*viveka-jnana*). The practice involves progressive negation: "this is not me; it is not mine; I am not this." When discrimination is complete, *prakriti* ceases to perform for that particular *purusha*.

## Nyaya: The Self That Is Not Essentially Conscious

Nyaya's position on consciousness is unlike anything in the Western canon. The self (*atman*) is a non-physical substance—but consciousness is not its essence. It is an *adventitious* quality that arises when the self connects with *manas* (the internal organ) and through *manas* with the sense organs. During dreamless sleep, the self exists without consciousness. Consciousness comes and goes; the self persists.

This makes Nyaya's *atman* closer to an Aristotelian substance that bears properties than to Descartes' *res cogitans*, defined by thinking. The self is not *what thinks* but *the thing that thinks when conditions are met*. According to the *Nyaya Sutra* (Gautama, c. 2nd century CE, 1.1.10), the self is the seat of desire, aversion, effort, pleasure, pain, and knowledge—but none of these is its defining nature.

### Arguments for the Self

The Nyaya school developed rigorous arguments against the Buddhist *anatman* (no-self) doctrine, culminating in Udayana's *Atmatattvaviveka* (c. 10th century):

**The memory argument**: Recollection ("I saw this person last week") requires a single subject persisting across time. One self cannot recollect another self's experiences. If the "I" of today were numerically different from the "I" of yesterday, memory would be impossible.

**Cross-modal synthesis**: Recognizing that the thing seen is the same thing touched requires a single experiencer synthesizing data from different senses. A bundle of momentary cognitions (the Buddhist position) cannot explain this convergence without something that unifies them.

**The unity argument**: The fact that a single subject experiences diverse perceptions simultaneously requires a unified, enduring subject. This parallels the [[binding-problem]] in Western philosophy—synchronised neural firing is still firing in separate neurons, and interaction alone does not explain unity.

### A Causal Theory of Perception

Nyaya developed the most rigorous perceptual theory in classical Indian philosophy. Perception (*pratyaksha*) involves a causal chain linking object, sense organ, *manas*, and self. Uddyotakara (c. 600 CE) systematized six types of sense-object contact. Gangesa (c. 1325 CE) distinguished indeterminate perception (*nirvikalpaka*)—non-conceptual awareness of bare particulars—from determinate perception (*savikalpaka*)—conceptual, classified awareness ("this is a blue pot"). Both stages produce valid knowledge.

Gangesa also developed a sophisticated theory of apperception (*anuvyavasaya*): awareness of being aware. He distinguished knowing *that* one cognizes (practically infallible) from knowing *what* one cognizes (fallible). This anticipates debates about higher-order theories of consciousness in contemporary philosophy of mind.

Notably, Nyaya *rejects* self-luminosity. Consciousness does not reveal itself; it arises through causal processes and requires the *manas*-*atman* connection. This makes Nyaya the closest Indian analogue to Western externalist epistemologies—and sets it directly against Advaita Vedanta.

## Vedanta: Consciousness as Ground

### Advaita Vedanta

Shankara (c. 788–820 CE) takes the most radical position: *Brahman*—non-dual, infinite consciousness—is the sole ultimate reality. The empirical world of plurality is appearance produced by *avidya* (ignorance). Individual identity is superimposition (*adhyasa*): we falsely attribute properties of the body-mind complex to consciousness and properties of consciousness to the body-mind, like mistaking a rope for a snake.

Consciousness (*cit*) is *svaprakasha*—self-luminous. It does not require another awareness to be known. Shankara argues that if a primary cognition required a second apperceptive cognition to be known, the second would require a third, generating an infinite regress. Self-luminosity terminates the regress. This directly contradicts Nyaya's position that consciousness arises through causal contact.

Advaita's three levels of reality structure the relationship between consciousness and the world: *paramarthika satta* (ultimate reality—Brahman alone), *vyavaharika satta* (empirical reality—the intersubjective world, dependently real), and *pratibhasika satta* (apparent reality—individual illusions like dreams). The Map's tenets operate at the *vyavaharika* level—and Advaita agrees that at this level, the mind-matter distinction holds. See [[witness-consciousness]] for the *sakshi* (witness-self) central to this framework.

### Ramanuja's Critique

Ramanuja (1017–1137 CE) developed Vishishtadvaita ("qualified non-dualism") partly through a devastating critique of Shankara. His seven objections (*sapta-vidha anupapatti*) remain philosophically forceful:

*Avidya* faces a circularity: if it resides in the individual self, but the individual self is itself a product of *avidya*, neither can ground the other. *Avidya* cannot coexist with *Brahman*, whose nature is pure consciousness—ignorance logically cannot persist in something whose fundamental nature is knowledge. And declaring *avidya* "indeterminable" (*anirvacaniya*)—neither real nor unreal—appears to violate the law of excluded middle.

Ramanuja's alternative: *Brahman* is real and qualified (*saguna*), possessing genuine attributes. Individual selves (*jivas*) and matter (*prakriti*) are eternally real and distinct—they constitute Brahman's *body* (*sharira*) while Brahman is their inner controller (*antaryamin*). Consciousness is always intentional—always *of* something—contra Shankara's non-intentional pure awareness.

This body-soul (*sharira-shariri*) model dissolves the interaction problem constitutively rather than causally: the relationship between Brahman and the world is like the relationship between a soul and its body. No causal bridge is needed because the relation is *internal*, not external.

## The Three-Way Disagreement

The deepest disagreement concerns what consciousness *is*:

| | Samkhya | Nyaya | Advaita Vedanta |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Consciousness** | Passive witness, separate from all activity | Adventitious quality arising from self-*manas* contact | The sole reality, self-luminous |
| **Mind's status** | Material (part of *prakriti*) | Internal organ mediating self and senses | Part of empirical appearance |
| **Interaction** | Proximity, no causal action | Genuine causal chain | No interaction problem (one reality) |
| **Self-luminosity** | *Purusha* illuminates but passively | Rejected—consciousness requires causal conditions | Affirmed—consciousness reveals itself |
| **Number of selves** | Many *purushas* | Many *atmans* | One *Brahman/atman* |

These are not superficial variations. Samkhya and Nyaya disagree on whether consciousness acts. Nyaya and Advaita disagree on whether consciousness is self-luminous. Samkhya and Advaita disagree on whether there are many conscious principles or one. Yet all three affirm what Western materialism denies: consciousness is irreducible to physical process.

## What Indian Philosophy Contributes

Three distinctive contributions are largely absent from Western philosophy of mind:

**Mind on the matter side.** Samkhya's placement of mind, intellect, and ego within *prakriti* anticipates functionalist intuitions—cognitive processing is material—while maintaining consciousness as ontologically distinct. Western philosophy has largely been forced to choose: either mind goes with consciousness (dualism) or with matter (physicalism). Samkhya's three-way distinction (consciousness / mind / gross matter) remains underexplored.

**Consciousness without essential consciousness.** Nyaya's view that the self exists without consciousness during dreamless sleep has no direct Western parallel. It separates the self from consciousness more radically than any Western dualism—and raises a question the Map must take seriously: does the Map's dualism require that the non-physical aspect of reality be *essentially* conscious, or only *contingently* so?

**Metaphysics as soteriology.** In all three traditions, the philosophy of mind is inseparable from liberation. Samkhya's *viveka-jnana*, Nyaya's correct knowledge through *pramanas*, Advaita's realisation of *atman-Brahman* identity—each treats metaphysical error about consciousness as the root cause of suffering. Western philosophy of mind since Descartes has treated the mind-body problem as a theoretical puzzle disconnected from human flourishing. Indian traditions treat getting consciousness right as the most practically urgent task there is.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The Map's engagement with Indian philosophy of mind connects to each tenet.

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]**: All three schools affirm consciousness as irreducible to matter—through independent arguments developed over millennia. This cross-school convergence *within* a single philosophical culture, achieved through sustained mutual criticism, provides evidence distinct from the cross-cultural convergence discussed in [[the-hard-problem-in-non-western-philosophy]]. Internal disagreement about what consciousness *is* coexists with agreement that it is not material.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]**: Samkhya's "proximity" model—*purusha* disturbs *prakriti*'s equilibrium through presence rather than force—shares a structural concern with the Map's quantum interaction model. Both seek the minimal interface between consciousness and matter. The parallel is thematic, not mechanistic: Samkhya predates quantum theory by two millennia.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]**: Nyaya provides the strongest Indian support, with its explicit causal chain from self through *manas* to sense organs—a form of [[agent-causation]] articulated independently of the Western tradition. Samkhya's passive *purusha* is a genuine tension. The Map sides with Nyaya over Samkhya on this point: consciousness acts, it does not merely witness.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]**: Samkhya's and Nyaya's insistence on multiple distinct selves, each with its own experiential history, supports the Map's concern that indexical identity matters. The question "Why am I *this* purusha and not another?" is meaningful in Samkhya—and the tradition takes it seriously enough to argue for it.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]**: Two millennia of rigorous internal debate—Samkhya against Nyaya against Vedanta against Buddhism—produced sophisticated positions that cannot be dismissed as pre-scientific naivety. The apparent simplicity of materialism looks less compelling when the traditions with the deepest sustained investigation of consciousness consistently find it irreducible.
