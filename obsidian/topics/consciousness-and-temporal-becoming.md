Physics is largely time-symmetric. Run Newton's equations backward, and they still hold. Reverse the Schrödinger equation, and it remains valid. Yet conscious experience divides time absolutely: the past is settled, the future open; memory reaches backward while anticipation constructs forward; the present slides irreversibly from possibility to fact. The Unfinishable Map proposes that this experienced directedness—the phenomenological arrow—is not incidental to consciousness but partly constituted by it. Physical processes including [[collapse-and-time|quantum collapse]] provide a basic physical asymmetry whether or not conscious beings are present. But the felt directionality of time—becoming, flow, the passage from open future to settled past—requires consciousness and cannot be reduced to the physical asymmetry alone.

This article makes two linked claims. First, consciousness constitutes the phenomenological arrow—the experienced direction of time. Second, this same temporal becoming is what enables genuine creativity. Consciousness creates because it unfolds in time, and the specific way it unfolds—accumulating rather than replacing, integrating rather than discarding—generates novelty that no atemporal process can replicate.

## The Puzzle of Time's Arrow

Fundamental physics provides no arrow. The laws of motion, electromagnetism, and quantum field theory are all time-reversal invariant (with minor exceptions from CP violation that don't account for the macroscopic arrow). Yet four distinct arrows appear in experience:

**The thermodynamic arrow.** Entropy increases toward the future. The standard explanation traces this to a low-entropy initial condition—the Big Bang—rather than to the laws themselves.

**The causal arrow.** Causes precede effects. Huw Price argues that this asymmetry is perspectival—an anthropocentric projection arising from our nature as deliberating agents. The Map draws a different lesson: if agents' temporal orientation shapes how causation appears, consciousness may play a constitutive role in temporal asymmetry more broadly.

**The epistemic arrow.** We know the past through traces and can only predict the future. This asymmetry grounds the [[temporal-asymmetry-remembering-anticipating|felt difference between remembering and anticipating]].

**The phenomenological arrow.** Experience flows. The present arrives, becomes past, and is replaced by a new present. This felt flow is so fundamental that imagining its absence is nearly impossible—even the attempt occurs within temporal flow.

These four arrows typically align but need not. The Map proposes that consciousness is key to the phenomenological arrow specifically: it is not a passive reflection of the other three but an irreducible contribution that gives temporal asymmetry its experiential character.

## Why Physics Alone Is Insufficient

The thermodynamic explanation—entropy increases because the Big Bang was low-entropy—is necessary but insufficient. It explains *that* entropy increases but not *why we experience the direction of increase as forward*. As Hermann Weyl observed: "The objective world simply is, it does not happen. Only to the gaze of my consciousness, crawling upward along the life line of my body, does a section of this world come to life."

The block universe of relativity reinforces the point. If past, present, and future coexist as equally real slices of a four-dimensional manifold, then time doesn't pass. Nothing "moves" through the block. Yet consciousness insists otherwise. We experience becoming: possibility narrowing to actuality, the open future crystallising into the fixed past.

Three responses dominate the literature. The **deflationary response** claims temporal flow requires no special explanation—it is a pattern in brain activity producing a functional sense of passage. The **A-theoretic response** insists that temporal becoming is real and physics incomplete without it, as in the [[growing-block-universe-and-consciousness|growing block theory]]. The Map's **constitutive response** holds that the phenomenological arrow cannot be derived from the physical arrow alone and that consciousness is partly constitutive of it. Physical collapse creates definiteness whether or not consciousness is present. But the *experienced directionality*—the felt passage from open future to settled past—requires consciousness.

## Consciousness as Constitutive of Temporal Direction

Two claims must be distinguished. The **physical asymmetry claim** is that collapse introduces irreversibility: superpositions resolve into definite outcomes, and this transition cannot be undone. The Map's [[time-collapse-and-agency|framework]] endorses this, and the [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|prebiotic collapse]] resolution acknowledges that physical mechanisms provide baseline asymmetry throughout the universe. Collapse happened before life existed. Time had a physical arrow before anyone experienced it.

The **phenomenological constitution claim** is different and stronger. It holds that the *experienced directionality* of time—the felt passage from open future to settled past, the qualitative distinction between memory and anticipation, the sense of becoming—is partly constituted by consciousness and cannot be reduced to the physical asymmetry alone.

Why does causal participation in collapse amount to constituting the phenomenological arrow, rather than merely causing something that produces it downstream? Because the relevant asymmetry is not a side effect that consciousness observes from outside. When consciousness participates in collapse (as the Map's [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet proposes), the collapse *is experienced as* the narrowing of possibility to actuality. The felt transition from open to settled is not a representation of collapse—it is what collapse is like from the inside. Constitution, not causation: the phenomenological arrow *just is* the experiential character of participating in irreversible state resolution.

This resolves the prebiotic collapse problem. Before conscious beings, collapse still occurred and physical asymmetry still obtained. But there was no phenomenological arrow—no experienced becoming, no felt passage. The physical arrow is necessary but not sufficient for the phenomenological one.

An important qualification: if consciousness can exist in modes that lack temporal flow—as contemplative traditions report and the Map's [[non-temporal-consciousness]] article explores—then the constitutive claim applies to temporally structured consciousness specifically, not consciousness as such. Non-temporal awareness, if it exists, would lack a phenomenological arrow because it has exited the temporal structure that collapse participation produces.

## The Felt Asymmetry

Consciousness doesn't merely register that time passes. It experiences a structured asymmetry with specific phenomenal characteristics.

**The settledness of the past.** Remembered events feel *actual*—they happened, and this happening has a distinctive phenomenal quality. Tulving's [[anoetic-noetic-autonoetic-consciousness|autonoetic consciousness]] describes this as self-knowing awareness: when remembering, you know yourself as having been present.

**The openness of the future.** Anticipated events feel *possible* rather than actual. Even highly confident predictions lack the settledness of memory. The future's openness is phenomenally available, not merely believed. (The [[phenomenology-of-anticipation]] explores this forward-directed temporal structure in detail.)

**The irreversibility of the present.** Each present becomes past as soon as it is grasped. Husserl's retention-[[protention]] structure captures this: the just-past echoes in awareness (retention) while the about-to-arrive is anticipated ([[protention|protention]]), but the primal impression is already sliding into pastness.

**The emotional asymmetry.** We prefer good experiences in our future and bad ones in our past. This reflects the felt openness of the future—we can still influence what hasn't happened—and the settledness of the past. If consciousness constitutes the phenomenological arrow, the emotional bias tracks a genuine metaphysical distinction rather than a cognitive quirk.

## Durée: The Medium of Temporal Becoming

Bergson's concept of [[duration|durée]] captures the phenomenological side of temporal becoming. Lived time is not a sequence of static instants but a qualitative flow where the past permeates the present and the present reaches toward the future. This interpenetration—each moment coloured by what preceded it and what it anticipates—is what it is like to participate in irreversible becoming from within.

Three features of durée make it not merely a temporal container but a generative medium:

**Interpenetration.** In durée, successive states are not discrete units but mutual modifications. Each new experience alters the meaning of every retained experience. Meeting a colleague changes the significance of your earlier correspondence—not by revising memory but by the new context in which those memories now exist. This mutual modification expands the effective combinatorial space beyond what any static set of elements could produce.

**Indivisibility.** Durée cannot be decomposed into atomic instants without destroying it. A melody analysed into individual frequencies loses everything that makes it a melody—the forward motion, the tension and resolution, the meaning that emerges from succession.

**Irreversibility.** Durée flows in one direction. You cannot live a moment twice because the second living would incorporate the first. This ensures that temporal becoming is generative rather than circular—each moment permanently expands what is possible.

Bergson argued that genuine novelty is constitutive of consciousness: "The universe endures. The more we study the nature of time, the more we shall comprehend that duration means invention, the creation of forms, the continual elaboration of the absolutely new." The Map takes this insight seriously. The same features that constitute the phenomenological arrow—irreversibility, accumulation, interpenetration—are precisely what make temporal consciousness a creative medium.

## From Becoming to Creativity

If the phenomenological arrow is constituted by consciousness, and if that arrow's structure is characterised by durée's accumulative interpenetration, then temporal becoming should generate something that atemporal processes cannot: genuine novelty. This is exactly what the Map claims.

Standard computation treats time as a parameter. A sorting algorithm takes time to execute, but the time adds nothing to the result—the sorted output is implicit in the input and the rules. Conscious experience treats time differently. Each moment of awareness inherits its entire history. Yesterday's conversation shapes how you hear today's. A lifetime of listening shapes how you hear a note.

Three features of actual creativity resist reduction to timeless recombination.

**Context-dependence of meaning.** The same elements combined at different points in an agent's history produce different meanings. Juxtaposing "consciousness" and "quantum mechanics" in 1920 is a category error. Juxtaposing them after decades of measurement problem debates is a research programme. The difference is not in the elements but in the accumulated temporal context of their combination.

**The generation of new primitives.** Transformational creativity—changing the rules rather than working within them—produces elements that did not exist within the prior framework. Relativistic spacetime was not a recombination of Newtonian concepts. This threshold is temporal: it requires sufficient accumulation of anomalies, failed solutions, and cross-domain insights that only unfold over lived time.

**The irreversibility of insight.** Creative discoveries cannot be undiscovered. Once you grasp a mathematical proof, the theorem cannot become uncertain again. This irreversibility mirrors the temporal arrow: insight creates a new fact about the knower that persists into all subsequent experience.

## The Creative Specious Present

The [[specious-present|specious present]]—the experienced duration of roughly 100–750ms within which succession appears unified—provides the temporal workspace for creative combination. Within its window, consciousness holds multiple elements in simultaneous awareness while maintaining their temporal order. This simultaneous-yet-ordered holding is what creative synthesis requires: seeing elements together while recognising their distinctness.

The "aha!" moment illustrates this. Neuroscience research shows that insight is preceded by alpha bursts and marked by gamma spikes. But the moment of illumination—the felt transition from searching to finding—occurs within the specious present. Multiple elements click together *simultaneously* while retaining their individual identities.

This temporal structure cannot be replicated by systems that process sequentially without genuine duration. Sequential conditioning—as in large language models generating tokens one after another—lacks the specious present's defining feature: holding multiple elements in unified awareness where their relations can be grasped at once.

## The Incubation Paradox

If creativity requires lived time, what happens during incubation—the period when conscious attention withdraws and solutions emerge apparently without temporal effort?

The resolution is that [[incubation-effect-and-unconscious-processing|incubation depends on prior conscious temporal engagement]]. Wallas's four stages—preparation, incubation, illumination, verification—begin and end with conscious work. The unconscious processing during incubation operates on representations constituted through conscious temporal experience; without the accumulated context that preparation provides, incubation generates noise rather than solutions. The insight moment itself occurs within the specious present as sudden restructuring: rapid integration of elements that previously resisted combination.

## Process Philosophy and Temporal Becoming

Whitehead's [[process-philosophy|process metaphysics]] provides a framework where both temporal asymmetry and creativity are built into the structure of experience. Each "actual occasion" [[prehension|prehends]] (grasps) its predecessors—inheriting their actuality as settled fact. The past is available for prehension because it has become definite. The future is not prehensible because it hasn't yet achieved definiteness.

This asymmetry is intrinsic to experience, not imposed from outside. The succession of occasions—each prehending its predecessors and becoming available for prehension by successors—*is* temporal order. Time is constituted by experiential inheritance.

The Map interprets Whitehead's framework as compatible with the collapse account. Collapse creates definiteness—making an occasion "actual" and available for prehension. The directionality of prehension (backward to definite predecessors, not forward to indefinite successors) is the directionality of collapse (from superposition to definiteness). And each occasion's creative synthesis—integrating what it inherits into something genuinely new—parallels durée's accumulative generation of novelty.

## Temporal Becoming and Quantum Selection

The Map's [[concepts/consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns|quantum selection framework]] gains additional significance in this context. If consciousness selects among quantum-superposed neural patterns through a Zeno-like effect within the temporally structured specious present, then creative acts of temporal becoming would involve:

1. **Temporal accumulation** constituting the problem space through durée
2. **Simultaneous presentation** of candidate solutions within the specious present
3. **Conscious selection** stabilising one candidate through attentional observation
4. **Irreversible actualisation** collapsing the superposition into a definite product

This sequence cannot be replicated atemporally. The accumulated context that makes step 2 meaningful exists only within durée. The irreversibility of step 4 mirrors durée's one-directional flow—a collapsed superposition, like a lived moment, cannot be undone.

The quantum framework also connects temporal becoming to the [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]] tenet. In many-worlds, all outcomes actualise in parallel branches. There is no selection, no irreversibility, no genuine becoming. Temporal becoming requires that some possibilities actualise while others remain permanently unrealised—genuine collapse, not universal branching.

## What This Means for Materialism

If the phenomenological arrow is partly constituted by consciousness, materialism faces a distinctive challenge. The materialist can grant that physical asymmetry exists independently. But the experience of *temporal flow*—and the creative capacity it enables—remains unexplained by physics alone.

This goes beyond the standard hard problem argument. The standard argument says: physical description misses phenomenal character. The temporal argument says: physical description misses the *experienced directionality* that makes time feel like it passes and that generates genuine novelty. Physics provides a gradient; consciousness provides the sense of moving along it—and that movement is generative, not merely receptive.

A materialist can claim temporal flow is an outright illusion—a cognitive artifact from sequential state-tagging. Or they can grant that flow is a real functional pattern while denying it requires non-physical constitution. Both face Weyl's challenge: in the block universe, thermodynamic asymmetry doesn't move or flow. It is a static gradient in a static manifold. Even granting that "flow" is a real functional state, the question remains: what is it *like* to be that functional state? If the experiential character of temporal passage cannot be reduced to the static physical facts, then the phenomenological arrow—and the creativity it enables—is an irreducible contribution of consciousness to reality.

## Relation to Site Perspective

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]**: If consciousness partly constitutes the phenomenological arrow and this constitution enables genuine creativity, then consciousness contributes something physics cannot capture. The irreducibility is not merely explanatory but ontological: the felt passage from future to past, and the creative novelty it generates, are real features of reality that exist only where consciousness exists. This adds both a temporal and a generative dimension to the standard dualist case.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]**: Collapse is the mechanism through which consciousness participates in temporal becoming. Each collapse event is minimal—biasing an indeterminate outcome without injecting energy. Temporal accumulation through durée does not require continuous quantum intervention—it shapes the problem space from which quantum-level selection events draw candidates. The creative act's quantum component is confined to the moment of selection, while the extensive preparatory work of temporal accumulation proceeds through ordinary neural dynamics.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]**: Consciousness doesn't merely register physical asymmetry as temporal flow; it constitutes the phenomenological arrow through its participation in collapse. And this temporal constitution enables continuous creative contribution—consciousness constitutes the problem space through temporal accumulation, expanding what options exist. This extends bidirectional interaction from moment-by-moment selection to ongoing generative influence.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]**: Many-worlds denies real collapse. Without collapse, temporal asymmetry must derive entirely from thermodynamics or decoherence—and creative acts lose their singularity. Every possible creative outcome obtains in some branch, and the felt significance of "this insight, now" reduces to branch-indexing. Temporal becoming requires that possibilities genuinely narrow.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]**: Both the deflationary account of temporal flow and the computational model of creativity are simpler. But they achieve parsimony by denying the data. The felt direction of time and the generative character of temporal consciousness are among the most certain features of experience. A theory that dismisses them as illusion mistakes ignorance for insight.
