If every fundamental property is a disposition—a power directed toward some manifestation—then what is consciousness? The Unfinishable Map's commitment to [[interactionist-dualism]] requires that phenomenal states possess genuine [[causal-powers]]. But the deeper metaphysical question is whether consciousness *is* a disposition, whether it *has* dispositions, or whether it reveals a category that dispositional ontology cannot accommodate. This question cuts to the heart of what properties are and whether the mind-body problem is fundamentally a problem about the nature of dispositions themselves.

The ontology of dispositions matters for consciousness because the dominant positions in philosophy of properties—categoricalism, dispositionalism, and identity theories—each generate different accounts of how mind relates to matter. A world where all properties are categorical needs external laws to produce effects; a world where all properties are dispositional has causation built in. Where consciousness falls in this taxonomy determines whether mental causation requires special pleading or follows naturally from the metaphysics of properties.

## The Dispositional Landscape

Contemporary metaphysics offers several positions on the nature of properties, each with consequences for consciousness.

**Pandispositionalism** (or "powers all the way down") holds that every fundamental property is essentially dispositional. There are no categorical bases underlying dispositions—charge just *is* the power to attract and repel; mass just *is* the power to resist acceleration and curve spacetime. Alexander Bird and Sydney Shoemaker defend versions of this view. If pandispositionalism is correct, then properties are exhausted by their causal profiles: what a property *is* equals what it *does*.

**Categoricalism** holds that fundamental properties are non-dispositional qualities. They have natures independent of their causal roles, and laws of nature impose causal structure from outside. David Lewis defended this: properties are categorical, and dispositional talk is shorthand for counterfactual conditionals grounded in laws. On this view, there is always a qualitative "what it is" that is distinct from "what it does."

**The identity theory of properties** (C.B. Martin, John Heil) holds that every fundamental property is simultaneously dispositional and categorical—two aspects of a single nature. Properties are powerful qualities: they have intrinsic qualitative character *and* essential directedness toward manifestation. There is no priority of one aspect over the other.

Each position faces a distinctive challenge when applied to consciousness.

## The Pandispositionalist Challenge

If properties are exhausted by their causal profiles, then consciousness must be either a disposition itself or something outside the framework entirely.

Consider what it would mean for phenomenal redness—the subjective experience of seeing red—to be a disposition. A disposition toward *what*? Dispositions point toward their manifestations: fragility points toward breaking, solubility toward dissolving. If phenomenal redness is a disposition, it must be essentially directed toward some effect. Perhaps toward red-related behaviour, toward certain neural responses, toward specific reports.

The problem is immediate. Phenomenal redness seems to have an intrinsic qualitative character—a "what it's like"—that is not exhausted by any behavioural or functional profile. This is the insight behind the [[knowledge-argument|knowledge argument]]: Mary learns something new when she sees red for the first time, even though she already knew every dispositional fact about colour experience. Physicalists contest this—some argue Mary gains a new *ability* rather than a new *fact*—but the Map holds that what she encounters is the qualitative aspect of a property that dispositional description cannot capture. If [[qualia]] were pure dispositions, there would be nothing left for Mary to learn.

Pandispositionalism thus faces a dilemma regarding consciousness. Either phenomenal properties are dispositions (in which case the qualitative character of experience collapses into causal role, and the hard problem dissolves into functionalism), or phenomenal properties are not dispositions (in which case pandispositionalism is false—not all properties are dispositional). The first horn abandons the hard problem; the second abandons the metaphysical thesis. This is the dispositional version of the [[explanatory-gap]]: no catalogue of causal roles entails qualitative character.

Some pandispositionalists bite the first bullet, accepting that qualia are functional properties fully captured by their causal roles. But this amounts to functionalism about consciousness, which faces well-known objections: inverted qualia scenarios, the conceivability of [[philosophical-zombies]], and the explanatory gap between functional description and phenomenal experience.

## Categoricalism and the Intrinsic Nature Problem

If categoricalism is correct—if properties have intrinsic natures independent of their causal roles—then consciousness might be a categorical property par excellence. Qualia are qualitative, intrinsic, and apparently non-relational. The redness of red is a quality, not a relation to other things.

This looks promising for dualism. If some properties are categorical, consciousness could be a fundamental categorical property irreducible to physical dispositions. The mind-body problem becomes a question about the relationship between categorical mental properties and the dispositional (or categorical) properties of physics.

But categoricalism faces its own difficulty. As [[russellian-monism]] highlights, physics describes only structural and relational properties—only what things *do*. If fundamental physical properties are categorical, physics never tells us what those categories are. We know that mass gravitates and that charge attracts, but not what mass or charge *is* intrinsically. The [[intrinsic-nature-void]] explores why this gap may be principled rather than merely epistemic.

This generates the Russellian gambit: perhaps consciousness *is* the intrinsic categorical nature that underlies physical dispositions. Qualia are what physical structure looks like from the inside. But as the Map argues in its treatment of [[russellian-monism]], this move faces the [[combination-problem]]: how do micro-level categorical-phenomenal properties combine into unified macro-consciousness?

## Powerful Qualities and Phenomenal Properties

The identity theory—properties as "powerful qualities"—offers a middle path that aligns with the Map's framework more naturally than either pure dispositionalism or pure categoricalism.

On Martin and Heil's view, a property's qualitative nature and its dispositional power are identical—two aspects of one reality, not two separable components. Charge has a qualitative character (whatever charge intrinsically is) that is identical with its causal power (attracting and repelling). You cannot peel apart the quality from the power; they are one thing under two descriptions.

Applied to consciousness: a phenomenal state's qualitative character (what the experience is like) and its causal power (its capacity to influence neural processes) could be two aspects of a single property. The redness of red experience is simultaneously a quality (phenomenal redness) and a power (the capacity to bias neural activity toward red-related responses). Mary doesn't learn a new disposition when she sees red—she encounters the qualitative aspect of a property whose dispositional aspect she already knew.

This framework has several advantages for the Map's position:

**It preserves the reality of qualia.** Unlike pandispositionalism, the identity theory doesn't reduce phenomenal character to causal role. The qualitative aspect is real and irreducible—it just happens to be identical with (not separate from) the dispositional aspect.

**It grounds mental causation naturally.** If phenomenal qualities are identical with causal powers, consciousness doesn't need a separate mechanism to influence the physical world. Its causal efficacy follows from its nature as a powerful quality. The question is not "how does a quality produce effects?" but rather "what kind of power does this quality-power exercise?"

**It avoids the combination problem.** Unlike Russellian monism, which posits micro-level quiddities that must combine, the Map's dualist framework posits unified phenomenal subjects from the start. The identity theory applies to the unified subject's properties, not to hypothetical micro-experiences.

## Dispositions, Consciousness, and the Interface

The Map's [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet specifies that consciousness biases quantum indeterminacies in neural systems. How does this relate to dispositional ontology?

If consciousness has genuine causal powers (as the Map's [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet holds), those powers have a dispositional structure: consciousness is *disposed* to bias certain quantum outcomes under certain triggering conditions. The triggering conditions include the presence of quantum indeterminacies in appropriate neural systems—what the Map calls the [[brain-interface-boundary|interface]]. The manifestation is a shift in which quantum outcome actualises.

This gives consciousness a specific dispositional profile while preserving its qualitative character. Consciousness is not *merely* its disposition to bias neural processes—that would collapse into pandispositionalism. Consciousness has a qualitative character (the felt quality of experience) that is inseparable from its dispositional power (the capacity to influence physical outcomes). The quality and the power are one.

The dispositional essentialist framework (Bird 2007) argues that if properties have essential dispositional natures, then the laws governing those properties are metaphysically necessary. Bird develops this for physical laws, but the Map extends the reasoning to psychophysical laws: if phenomenal properties have essential dispositional natures, then [[psychophysical-laws]] governing how consciousness influences neural activity follow from the nature of consciousness itself rather than being contingent additions to physics.

Alternatively, if psychophysical laws are contingent (as governing-law theorists hold), then consciousness has its causal powers not from its intrinsic nature but from external lawlike regularities. The Map finds the essentialist picture more satisfying: it grounds mental causation in the nature of experience rather than in brute, unexplained regularities.

## The Dispositional Modality Problem

A deeper puzzle emerges when we consider what dispositions *point toward*. Standard dispositions have clear manifestation conditions: fragility manifests as breaking when struck; solubility manifests as dissolving when immersed. The manifestation is a distinct event from the disposition itself.

But consciousness has a peculiar relationship with its own manifestations. When pain disposes you to withdraw your hand, the pain experience is not separate from its causal role in the way that salt's molecular structure is separate from its dissolving. The phenomenal quality of pain—its hurting—seems constitutively connected to its motivational power. Change the felt quality and you change the disposition. The condition of [[pain-asymbolia]]—where patients report feeling pain but lack its characteristic aversiveness—is consistent with this picture: the dissociation of quality from motivational power produces exactly the behavioural changes that the powerful-qualities framework would predict.

This suggests that phenomenal dispositions have a unique modal character. Physical dispositions point outward—toward effects in other things. Phenomenal dispositions also point inward—toward the subject's own experiential states, motivations, and deliberative processes. The bidirectionality of phenomenal dispositions (outward toward neural effects, inward toward experiential meaning) may be what distinguishes conscious powers from mere physical powers.

If this is right, then consciousness occupies a distinctive position in the ontology of dispositions: it is the only case where the qualitative character of a disposition and its causal directedness are accessible from the inside. We know what it is like to be a powerful quality because we *are* powerful qualities, exercising our dispositional natures through every act of attention and deliberation.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The Map's [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]] tenet holds that consciousness is irreducible to physical processes. In dispositional terms, this means phenomenal properties cannot be identified with or reduced to physical dispositions. Even a complete catalogue of physical powers—every disposition of every particle—would not entail the existence of phenomenal experience. This is the dispositional version of the [[explanatory-gap]].

The [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet commits the Map to consciousness possessing genuine causal powers—real dispositions to influence neural outcomes. The identity theory of properties (powerful qualities) provides the most natural framework: phenomenal character and causal power are two aspects of a single mental property.

The [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet specifies the scope of consciousness's dispositions: they manifest at quantum indeterminacies in neural systems, biasing outcomes without injecting energy. This is a constrained dispositional profile—consciousness has the power to select among physically permissible outcomes, not the power to override physics.

The [[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]] tenet applies directly. Pandispositionalism appears simpler than the identity theory—one category of properties instead of two aspects. But this simplicity comes at the cost of eliminating qualitative character, which is the one feature of reality we know most directly. As with materialism generally, apparent parsimony masks genuine explanatory loss.

The central insight the Map draws from dispositional ontology is this: the mind-body problem is not just about what consciousness *is*—it is about what *properties* are. If properties are exhausted by their causal roles, consciousness becomes deeply puzzling (or gets explained away). If properties have intrinsic qualitative natures that ground their causal powers, consciousness becomes the paradigmatic case of what a property really is—a powerful quality known from the inside.
