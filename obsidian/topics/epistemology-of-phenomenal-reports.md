The Unfinishable Map holds that phenomenal reports—verbal or behavioural expressions of what conscious experience is like—constitute genuine scientific data, not mere noise to be explained away. Excluding them from evidence impoverishes consciousness research, while including them raises hard questions about reliability, intersubjective validation, and the limits of third-person methodology. The epistemology of phenomenal reports sits at the intersection of philosophy of science and philosophy of mind, and how it is resolved determines whether a science of consciousness is possible at all.

## The Evidential Status Problem

Every empirical science rests on observations. In physics, chemistry, and biology, observations are publicly accessible: multiple instruments and observers converge on the same measurements. Consciousness appears to break this pattern. A subject reporting "I see red" makes a claim about a [[phenomenal-consciousness|phenomenal state]] that no external instrument can directly verify. The report is public; the experience is not.

This asymmetry creates a dilemma. If science restricts itself to third-person data—neural imaging, behavioural measures, physiological correlates—it can study the correlates of consciousness but never consciousness itself. The [[explanatory-gap]] between physical description and phenomenal character remains unbridged because the very data that could bridge it has been ruled inadmissible. Yet if science admits first-person reports, it must address their reliability, since [[introspection]] is fallible.

The standard move in much of cognitive science has been to adopt something like [[heterophenomenology]]—Daniel Dennett's proposal to take reports as data about what subjects *believe* about their experience, without committing to whether those beliefs accurately reflect phenomenal reality. This preserves methodological caution. But it purchases that caution at a steep price: it assumes from the outset that first-person access might be systematically unreliable, which is precisely the question at issue.

## Why Phenomenal Reports Cannot Be Eliminated

The attempt to do consciousness science without phenomenal reports faces a structural problem. Consider what a purely third-person neuroscience of consciousness would look like. Researchers would identify neural correlates—brain states that reliably accompany reported experiences. But "accompany reported experiences" already presupposes the evidential standing of reports. Without subjects telling researchers what they experience, there is no way to identify which brain states are correlates of *consciousness* as opposed to correlates of information processing that happens to occur without experience.

The neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) research programme depends entirely on phenomenal reports to establish the "consciousness" side of the correlation. Remove the reports and the programme collapses into a study of neural activity with no way to distinguish conscious from unconscious processing. Every contrastive methodology—comparing brain states when subjects report awareness versus when they do not—relies on taking reports seriously as indicators of phenomenal states.

This creates an uncomfortable circularity for eliminativists: the very neuroscience they cite to debunk phenomenal reports could not have been conducted without trusting those reports as data.

## The Reliability Question

Admitting that phenomenal reports are indispensable does not mean accepting them uncritically. [[Introspection]] is demonstrably fallible in certain domains. Nisbett and Wilson's classic 1977 studies showed that people confabulate explanations for their choices, reporting reasons that could not have caused their decisions. Change blindness experiments reveal that subjects fail to notice substantial alterations in their visual field. These findings ground legitimate scepticism.

However, as the Map's treatment of [[introspection-rehabilitation|introspection rehabilitation]] argues, these critiques conflate two distinct targets. The process/content distinction is crucial: introspection about *why* we chose something (causal process) is unreliable, but introspection about *what* we are currently experiencing (phenomenal content) operates differently. When a subject reports seeing red, they are not theorising about causal mechanisms—they are reporting the qualitative character of their present experience.

Evidence supports this distinction. Fox et al. documented that introspective accuracy follows a logarithmic learning curve—subjects improve with systematic training. [[Neurophenomenology|Neurophenomenological]] research shows that trained meditators' phenomenal reports predict distinct neural signatures, providing cross-modal validation. The reports are not arbitrary; they track something real enough to generate novel neuroscientific predictions.

## Intersubjective Convergence

A deeper challenge: even granting that individual phenomenal reports are often accurate, how do they gain the [[intersubjectivity|intersubjective]] standing that science demands? If experience is private, how can phenomenal reports be publicly validated?

The answer emerges from convergence patterns. When independently trained contemplatives from different traditions—Buddhist Vipassana practitioners, Christian contemplatives, phenomenological researchers—arrive at structurally similar descriptions of attentional states, the probability of coordinated confabulation drops. The convergence is not perfect, but it is far better than chance, and it improves with methodological discipline.

This mirrors how science handles other unobservable entities. No one directly sees an electron; its existence is inferred from convergent instrumental readings. Phenomenal reports function analogously—as instrumental readings from the only instrument with direct access to consciousness: the conscious subject themselves. The instrument is imperfect, but its outputs can be cross-checked through intersubjective comparison, behavioural prediction, and neural correlation.

The [[neurophenomenology|neurophenomenological]] framework formalises this through mutual constraint: phenomenal reports constrain which neural theories are admissible, while neural findings constrain which phenomenal reports are credible. Neither side dictates to the other. This bilateral methodology avoids both naive introspectionism and eliminative reductionism.

## The Self-Stultification of Eliminativism

Attempts to eliminate phenomenal reports from science face a deeper problem than mere methodological inconvenience. As the Map's treatment of [[epiphenomenalism]] argues, if consciousness were causally inert—if phenomenal states played no role in producing reports—then the reports would be causally disconnected from the experiences they purport to describe. They would be accidentally right at best.

This self-stultification extends to eliminativism about phenomenal reports themselves. If a theorist argues that phenomenal reports do not reliably indicate phenomenal states, their argument depends on their own phenomenal awareness of what arguments seem compelling, what evidence seems relevant, and what conclusions seem warranted. The theorist must trust their own phenomenal access to the evidential landscape while denying that such access is trustworthy in general.

This is not a knock-down refutation—a sufficiently determined eliminativist can bite the bullet and accept that their own theorising is not guided by phenomenal awareness. But the position becomes pragmatically self-defeating: it cannot be rationally advocated by a conscious agent without performative contradiction.

## What Phenomenal Reports Reveal About Scientific Methodology

The epistemology of phenomenal reports exposes a tension within scientific methodology itself. Science aspires to objectivity—the "view from nowhere" that Thomas Nagel identified as inherently unable to capture consciousness's perspective-dependent nature. As the Map's treatment of [[objectivity-and-consciousness]] argues, this aspiration works brilliantly for phenomena that do not essentially involve a point of view. It struggles with the one phenomenon that *is* a point of view.

This does not mean science must abandon objectivity. It means recognising that objectivity comes in degrees, and that some phenomena may require methodological pluralism. The first-person/third-person divide in [[first-person-third-person-methodology|consciousness research methodology]] reflects a genuine ontological asymmetry, not merely a gap in current techniques. If consciousness is irreducible to physical processes, then no third-person method will ever fully capture what phenomenal reports convey.

The [[knowledge-argument]] makes this vivid: Mary, who knows all physical facts about colour vision, still learns something new upon seeing red. What she learns is precisely what a phenomenal report attempts to communicate—the qualitative character of experience that physical description leaves out.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The Map's [[tenets]] bear directly on the epistemology of phenomenal reports. The dualism tenet holds that consciousness is not reducible to physical processes, which means phenomenal reports convey information that no third-person description can fully capture. They are not redundant summaries of neural data but windows onto an ontologically distinct domain.

The bidirectional interaction tenet strengthens this: if consciousness causally influences physical outcomes, then phenomenal reports are not epiphenomenal accompaniments to brain activity but causally produced by the experiences they describe. A subject's report of pain is caused (in part) by the pain itself, not merely by nociceptive processing that happens to co-occur with pain. This grounds the reliability of phenomenal reports in causal connection rather than pre-established harmony.

The Occam's Razor tenet is also relevant. Eliminativists about phenomenal reports often appeal to parsimony—why posit irreducible phenomenal states when neural explanations seem simpler? The Map responds that apparent simplicity can reflect ignorance. A methodology that excludes first-person data is not parsimonious; it is incomplete. The seeming simplicity of a purely third-person science of consciousness is achieved by ignoring the phenomenon it purports to study.
