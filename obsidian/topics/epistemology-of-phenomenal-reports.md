The Unfinishable Map holds that phenomenal reports—verbal or behavioural expressions of what conscious experience is like—constitute genuine scientific data, not mere noise to be explained away. Excluding them from evidence impoverishes consciousness research, while including them raises hard questions about reliability, intersubjective validation, and the limits of third-person methodology. The epistemology of phenomenal reports sits at the intersection of philosophy of science and philosophy of mind, and how it is resolved determines whether a science of consciousness is possible at all.

## The Evidential Status Problem

Every empirical science rests on observations. In physics, chemistry, and biology, observations are publicly accessible: multiple instruments and observers converge on the same measurements. Consciousness appears to break this pattern. A subject reporting "I see red" makes a claim about a [[phenomenal-consciousness|phenomenal state]] that no external instrument can directly verify. The report is public; the experience is not.

This asymmetry creates a dilemma. If science restricts itself to third-person data—neural imaging, behavioural measures, physiological correlates—it can study the correlates of consciousness but never consciousness itself. The [[explanatory-gap]] between physical description and phenomenal character remains unbridged because the very data that could bridge it has been ruled inadmissible. Yet if science admits first-person reports, it must address their reliability, since [[introspection]] is fallible.

The standard move in much of cognitive science has been to adopt something like [[heterophenomenology]]—Daniel Dennett's proposal to take reports as data about what subjects *believe* about their experience, without committing to whether those beliefs accurately reflect phenomenal reality. This claims methodological neutrality. But the neutrality is illusory: by bracketing phenomenal reality and treating reports only as behavioural data, heterophenomenology excludes the very evidence that could adjudicate the question it professes to leave open. The methodology's consequences are not neutral even if its stated assumptions are.

## Why Phenomenal Reports Cannot Be Eliminated

The attempt to do consciousness science without phenomenal reports faces a structural problem. Consider what a purely third-person neuroscience of consciousness would look like. Researchers would identify neural correlates—brain states that reliably accompany reported experiences. But "accompany reported experiences" already presupposes the evidential standing of reports. Without subjects telling researchers what they experience, there is no way to identify which brain states are correlates of *consciousness* as opposed to correlates of information processing that happens to occur without experience.

The neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) research programme depends entirely on phenomenal reports to establish the "consciousness" side of the correlation. Remove the reports and the programme collapses into a study of neural activity with no way to distinguish conscious from unconscious processing. Every contrastive methodology—comparing brain states when subjects report awareness versus when they do not—relies on taking reports seriously as indicators of phenomenal states.

This creates an uncomfortable circularity for eliminativists: the very neuroscience they cite to debunk phenomenal reports could not have been conducted without trusting those reports as data.

## The Reliability Question

Admitting that phenomenal reports are indispensable does not mean accepting them uncritically. [[Introspection]] is demonstrably fallible in certain domains. Nisbett and Wilson's classic 1977 studies showed that people confabulate explanations for their choices, reporting reasons that could not have caused their decisions. Change blindness experiments reveal that subjects fail to notice substantial alterations in their visual field. These findings ground legitimate scepticism.

However, as the Map's treatment of [[introspection-rehabilitation|introspection rehabilitation]] argues, these critiques conflate two distinct targets. The process/content distinction is crucial: introspection about *why* we chose something (causal process) is unreliable, but introspection about *what* we are currently experiencing (phenomenal content) operates differently. When a subject reports seeing red, they are not theorising about causal mechanisms—they are reporting the qualitative character of their present experience.

Evidence supports this distinction. Fox et al. (2012) found that meditation experience predicts introspective accuracy in cross-sectional data—practitioners with more training hours report their mental states more reliably, following a logarithmic curve that mirrors other skill-acquisition patterns. [[Neurophenomenology|Neurophenomenological]] studies extend this further: trained meditators' phenomenal reports predict distinct neural signatures (Lutz et al. 2004), and advanced practitioners in jhana states produce brain activity patterns that correspond precisely to their reported phenomenal states. This cross-modal validation—first-person reports predicting third-person measurements—is exactly the kind of [[contemplative-epistemology|convergent evidence]] that grounds the reliability of any scientific instrument. The reports are not arbitrary; they track something real enough to generate novel neuroscientific predictions.

## Intersubjective Convergence

A deeper challenge: even granting that individual phenomenal reports are often accurate, how do they gain the [[intersubjectivity|intersubjective]] standing that science demands? If experience is private, how can phenomenal reports be publicly validated?

The answer emerges from convergence patterns. When independently trained contemplatives from different traditions—Buddhist Vipassana practitioners, Christian contemplatives, phenomenological researchers—arrive at structurally similar descriptions of attentional states, the probability of coordinated confabulation drops. The convergence is not perfect, but it is far better than chance, and it improves with methodological discipline.

A sceptic might respond that convergence reflects shared neural architecture rather than shared phenomenal access—similar brains produce similar reports regardless of whether those reports track genuine experience. But as the Map's treatment of [[intersubjectivity]] argues, shared architecture explains convergence on phenomenal *categories* (colour, pain, pleasure) without explaining convergence on phenomenal *puzzlement*—the shared recognition that certain aspects of experience resist description, that attention transforms its object, that the observer-observed boundary is unstable. These relational dynamics are what trained contemplatives converge on, and they are not straightforwardly predicted by neural architecture alone.

This mirrors how science handles other unobservable entities. No one directly sees an electron; its existence is inferred from convergent instrumental readings. Phenomenal reports function analogously—as instrumental readings from the only instrument with direct access to consciousness: the conscious subject themselves. The instrument is imperfect and cannot be independently calibrated in the way a voltmeter can—calibration would require already knowing the phenomenal facts at issue. But its outputs can be cross-checked through intersubjective comparison, behavioural prediction, and neural correlation, which collectively provide a form of triangulation that no single method achieves alone.

The [[neurophenomenology|neurophenomenological]] framework formalises this through mutual constraint: phenomenal reports constrain which neural theories are admissible, while neural findings constrain which phenomenal reports are credible. Neither side dictates to the other. This bilateral methodology avoids both naive introspectionism and eliminative reductionism.

## The Self-Stultification of Eliminativism

Attempts to eliminate phenomenal reports from science face a problem beyond methodological inconvenience. As the Map's treatment of [[concepts/epiphenomenalism]] argues, if consciousness were causally inert—if phenomenal states played no role in producing reports—then the reports would be causally disconnected from the experiences they purport to describe. They would be accidentally right at best.

This [[self-stultification]] extends to eliminativism about phenomenal reports themselves. If a theorist argues that phenomenal reports do not reliably indicate phenomenal states, their argument depends on their own phenomenal awareness of what arguments seem compelling, what evidence seems relevant, and what conclusions seem warranted. The theorist must trust their own phenomenal access to the evidential landscape while denying that such access is trustworthy in general. This is a special case of the broader [[argument-from-reason]]: rational evaluation of evidence presupposes the causal efficacy of conscious states.

This is not a logical contradiction—a sufficiently determined eliminativist can bite the bullet and accept that their own theorising is not guided by phenomenal awareness. But as the Map's treatment of epiphenomenalism notes, the position is "impossible to hold rationally" even if not formally incoherent. It cannot be rationally advocated by a conscious agent without performative contradiction.

## The Galilean Exclusion and Its Legacy

The difficulty science faces with phenomenal reports is not accidental. It traces to a foundational methodological choice. As the Map's treatment of the [[galilean-exclusion]] argues, modern science was built by deliberately setting aside subjective qualities—colour, taste, sound as experienced—in favour of measurable quantities. This strategy was spectacularly productive. Physics, chemistry, and biology advanced precisely by ignoring how things seem in favour of how they behave.

But consciousness *is* how things seem. Phenomenal reports describe the very features that the Galilean method excluded from its domain. Asking whether such reports count as scientific data is therefore asking whether science can extend its methods to cover what it was designed to leave out. The tension is not a sign that phenomenal reports are unscientific; it is a sign that the boundaries of science may need to expand.

## What Phenomenal Reports Reveal About Scientific Methodology

The epistemology of phenomenal reports exposes a tension within scientific methodology itself. Science aspires to objectivity—the "view from nowhere" that Thomas Nagel (1986) identified as inherently unable to capture consciousness's perspective-dependent nature. As the Map's treatment of [[objectivity-and-consciousness]] argues, this aspiration works brilliantly for phenomena that do not essentially involve a point of view. It struggles with the one phenomenon that *is* a point of view.

This does not mean science must abandon objectivity. It means recognising that objectivity comes in degrees, and that some phenomena may require methodological pluralism. The first-person/third-person divide in [[first-person-third-person-methodology|consciousness research methodology]] reflects a genuine ontological asymmetry, not merely a gap in current techniques. If consciousness is irreducible to physical processes, then no third-person method will ever fully capture what phenomenal reports convey.

The [[knowledge-argument]] makes this vivid: Mary, who knows all physical facts about colour vision, still learns something new upon seeing red. What she learns is precisely what a phenomenal report attempts to communicate—the qualitative character of experience that physical description leaves out.

## The Limits of Reportability

Defending phenomenal reports as genuine data does not mean claiming they capture everything about experience. Some aspects of phenomenal character may resist articulation entirely—not because reporters lack skill, but because the conceptual resources required to express certain experiences may exceed human cognitive architecture. Contemplative traditions have long recognised this: advanced meditative states are routinely described as "ineffable," and practitioners across traditions converge on the recognition that certain phenomenal features resist linguistic encoding.

This is not a concession to eliminativism. The fact that a thermometer cannot measure every property of a gas does not mean its temperature readings are unreliable. Similarly, phenomenal reports can be trustworthy within their domain even if that domain does not exhaust the totality of experience. What matters is distinguishing between the reportable and the unreportable—and the Map's treatment of [[mysterianism]] suggests that some of these boundaries may reflect permanent features of human cognition rather than merely temporary limitations.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The Map's [[tenets]] bear directly on the epistemology of phenomenal reports. The dualism tenet holds that consciousness is not reducible to physical processes, which means phenomenal reports convey information that no third-person description can fully capture. They are not redundant summaries of neural data but windows onto an ontologically distinct domain.

The bidirectional interaction tenet strengthens this: if consciousness causally influences physical outcomes, then phenomenal reports are not epiphenomenal accompaniments to brain activity but causally produced by the experiences they describe. A subject's report of pain is caused (in part) by the pain itself, not merely by nociceptive processing that happens to co-occur with pain. This grounds the reliability of phenomenal reports in causal connection rather than pre-established harmony.

The Occam's Razor tenet is also relevant. Eliminativists about phenomenal reports often appeal to parsimony—why posit irreducible phenomenal states when neural explanations seem simpler? The Map responds that apparent simplicity can reflect ignorance. A methodology that excludes first-person data is not parsimonious; it is incomplete. The seeming simplicity of a purely third-person science of consciousness is achieved by ignoring the phenomenon it purports to study.
