Where does value come from? Not instrumental value—the usefulness of a hammer or the market price of a house—but *intrinsic* value, the kind that makes something worth caring about for its own sake. The Unfinishable Map holds that intrinsic value is a feature of conscious experience itself. The felt badness of suffering *is* badness. The felt goodness of joy *is* goodness. This position—[[phenomenal-value-realism]]—is not one commitment among many for the Map. It is where the Map's metaphysics meets the questions that matter most.

## The Claim in Plain Terms

Phenomenal value realism says that certain qualities of experience are simultaneously descriptive and normative. Pain describes how an experience feels *and* constitutes something bad. These are not two properties that happen to coincide—they are one property under two descriptions.

This is not the claim that pleasure is *correlated* with goodness, or that evolution designed us to *treat* pleasure as good. It is an identity claim: to experience pleasure is to instantiate goodness. To experience suffering is to instantiate badness. Sharon Hewitt Rawlette, in *The Feeling of Value* (2016), puts it directly: "When we feel pleasure, we are feeling intrinsic goodness itself."

Three tests support the identity:

**The coherence test.** "This is intensely pleasant, but there is nothing good about it." The sentence is not merely false—it is incoherent, like "this triangle has four sides." Someone who sincerely asserts it means something different by "pleasant" than everyone else does.

**The transparency test.** When experiencing pleasure, you do not infer its goodness from a theory. The goodness is transparent in the experience—attending to the pleasure just *is* attending to something good. There is no residual question "granted this is pleasant, but *why* is it good?" The question dissolves because goodness is what you are already attending to.

**The explanatory economy test.** If pleasure and goodness were distinct properties, their perfect correlation would demand explanation. What mechanism ensures every pleasure is good? The identity thesis eliminates this burden: they correlate because they are the same thing.

## What the Alternatives Miss

### Preference Satisfaction

The dominant approach in economics and much of AI alignment grounds value in preference satisfaction: what is good for you is getting what you want. The Map rejects this. Evolution shaped preferences for reproductive fitness, not flourishing. You can prefer things that make your experience worse—addictive substances, status games that produce anxiety, comfort zones that prevent growth.

More fundamentally, preferences are *about* experiential states they do not capture. You prefer to avoid pain because pain feels bad. The preference tracks the value; it does not constitute it. A system that satisfies preferences without generating any conscious experience has achieved nothing of value—it has optimised a function that was only ever a proxy for what matters.

This matters urgently for [[purpose-and-alignment|AI alignment]]. If we align AI systems to maximise preference satisfaction, we target a proxy that can come apart from the thing it tracks. [[experiential-alignment|Experiential alignment]]—targeting the felt quality of conscious life—aims at the real thing.

### Error Theory

Error theorists hold that all moral claims are false because nothing has objective value. The universe is just matter in motion; "good" and "bad" are projections we impose.

Phenomenal value realism's response is direct: attend to actual suffering. Not the concept of suffering, not a description of neural activation patterns—the experience itself. The claim "this suffering contains nothing bad" is not a bold philosophical thesis. It is a failure to understand what the word "bad" refers to.

Error theory gains its plausibility from considering value abstractly, at a distance. It loses plausibility the moment one considers actual experience. The felt character of agony is not a projection onto neutral events; it is what badness *is*.

### Constructivism

Constructivists hold that value is built through rational procedures (Rawls) or social practices (Korsgaard). Moral facts are products of reasoning, not features of experience waiting to be discovered.

The Map's objection: consciousness was valuable before any reasoning being existed to construct value systems. The suffering of the first creature capable of feeling pain was bad—not because a social practice labelled it so, but because of what pain feels like from the inside. Value was there before anyone constructed it.

Constructivism also cannot explain the authority of moral claims. If value is constructed, why should the construction bind us? The constructivist answer—because rational agents would endorse it—assumes rationality is authoritative, which requires further construction. The regress terminates only when we reach something that matters intrinsically: the felt quality of experience.

## Beyond Hedonism

Rawlette defends a hedonistic version: pleasure and pain exhaust intrinsic value. The Map extends this to **phenomenal value pluralism**. Multiple features of experience have intrinsic value—not just hedonic valence:

Meaning, as experienced in deep engagement with what matters, carries value independent of pleasure. Completing a difficult creative project can involve frustration and exhaustion, yet the engagement feels intrinsically significant.

Agency—the felt authorship of genuine choices—is valuable even when the choices are difficult. If consciousness genuinely influences physical outcomes (as the Map's [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet holds), then exercising that capacity has intrinsic significance.

Understanding produces a distinctive phenomenal quality—the "click" of grasping something—that is not reducible to pleasure. You can understand something that brings no pleasure yet find the understanding itself valuable.

The extension preserves Rawlette's core insight: all intrinsic value resides in conscious experience. The pluralism operates *within* the experiential domain. What it rejects is the narrowing of value to a single experiential dimension.

## Why Dualism Matters Here

Most defenders of phenomenal value realism work within physicalist frameworks. The Map's [[tenets#^dualism|dualism]] gives the position distinctive weight.

If consciousness is irreducible—if phenomenal properties are not captured by physical description—then value inherits this irreducibility. Value is not an overlay on material reality, not a useful fiction, not a projection by brains that evolved to socialise. It is built into what fundamentally exists.

This answers one of moral realism's oldest challenges: where do objective values *fit* in the natural world? The physicalist struggles to locate them among particles and fields. The non-naturalist posits mysterious entities. The dualist who grounds value in consciousness has a straightforward answer: values fit wherever consciousness fits. If consciousness is fundamental, value is fundamental.

The Map's emphasis on [[haecceity|indexical identity]] extends to value. *This* experience matters—not just experiences-of-this-type. Your particular suffering is not interchangeable with a qualitatively identical suffering in someone else. Most value theories treat value as type-based; the Map suggests it is token-based. This connects to the [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]] tenet: if every quantum event spawns branches where all outcomes occur, moral urgency dissolves. Reducing *this* suffering matters only if *this* outcome is the outcome.

## The Hardest Objection

The strongest challenge comes from [[illusionism]]: the claim that phenomenal consciousness itself is an introspective illusion. If there is no genuine "what it's like," then phenomenal value realism has no referent. Value would reduce to functional states tracking evolutionary fitness.

Three responses bear weight.

**The regress response.** For the illusion to occur, something must be deceived. If the subject is itself illusory, no one is deceived and there is no illusion. If the subject is real, it has genuine states of being-appeared-to—which are themselves phenomenal. Illusionism cannot eliminate phenomenal experience without eliminating the very thing that makes an experience illusory.

**The practical response.** Illusionists treat their own suffering as mattering. They take painkillers, avoid distress, and care about others' welfare. If phenomenal value is illusory, this behaviour is unmotivated. The functional state generating "reports of badness" would have no normative significance—yet illusionists act as if it does.

**The contemplative response.** Meditators across traditions report that sustained attention to experience reveals valence as intrinsic to it, not attributed by judgment. If illusionism were correct, deeper investigation should reveal the construction mechanism. Contemplatives report the opposite: the value becomes more apparent, not less.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Phenomenal value realism is where the Map's abstract metaphysics becomes personally significant.

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]** holds that consciousness is irreducible. Phenomenal value realism identifies what makes irreducibility matter: not just that consciousness is ontologically distinct, but that it is where all value resides. The explanatory gap between physics and experience extends to an evaluative gap. No equation captures why pain is bad.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]** claims consciousness causally shapes the physical world. If consciousness also grounds value, moral choices have real physical consequences—not despite their moral character but because of it. This makes moral agency metaphysically robust, not epiphenomenal decoration.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]** proposes that consciousness acts at quantum indeterminacies. Combined with phenomenal value realism, this means value-laden experience participates in determining physical outcomes. The felt significance of a moral choice is not causally idle; it contributes to the outcome.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]** preserves the moral weight of individual outcomes. If all branches are equally real, suffering is never truly reduced—only redistributed. Phenomenal value realism requires that *this* suffering, in *this* branch, is what matters. Many-worlds makes moral urgency incoherent.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]** applies when critics dismiss consciousness-grounded value as overcomplicated. Simpler accounts—value as fitness, value as preference—gain parsimony by ignoring what we know most directly: that suffering feels bad and joy feels good. This parsimony is bought by ignoring the primary datum.
