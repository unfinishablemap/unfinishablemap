The Unfinishable Map's dualism entails that phenomenal properties are irreducible to physical description. This creates a problem that goes deeper than the familiar [[problem-of-other-minds|problem of other minds]]: even if we grant that others are conscious, we have no way to determine *which* phenomenal properties they instantiate. The problem of other minds asks whether anyone else is home. The problem of other properties asks what it is like *inside* their home — and argues that the answer is structurally inaccessible.

This matters because it constrains what any science of consciousness can achieve. Physical observation can correlate brain states with behavioural reports, but if [[qualia]] are irreducible, no third-person investigation can establish that your red and my red are the same property. The [[explanatory-gap]] is not merely a gap between physics and experience in general — it is a gap between physics and *each specific quality* of experience.

## From Other Minds to Other Properties

The classical problem of other minds concerns existence: how do I know that the person across the table has conscious experience at all? Responses typically appeal to analogy (they behave like me, so probably feel like me), inference to the best explanation (consciousness explains their behaviour), or constitutive connections between behaviour and mentality.

These responses, even if successful, leave a harder question untouched. Granting that another person is conscious tells us nothing about the character of their experience. The [[inverted-qualia|inverted spectrum hypothesis]] makes this vivid: two people could be functionally identical — same discriminations, same verbal reports, same neural architecture — while their phenomenal colour spaces are systematically inverted. One sees what the other would call red where the other sees what the first would call green. Nothing in their behaviour or brain activity need differ.

The inverted spectrum is usually discussed as a thought experiment against functionalism. But it has a more unsettling implication: if functional role does not fix phenomenal character, then we are systematically cut off from knowing which phenomenal properties others instantiate. This is not a failure of current science. It is a structural feature of the relationship between physical description and phenomenal reality.

## Why Physical Correlation Cannot Close the Gap

Neuroscience correlates brain states with reported experiences. When someone reports seeing red, specific neural populations activate. Could sufficiently detailed brain scanning establish that two people share the same phenomenal property?

No — and the reason is the same one that drives the [[knowledge-argument|knowledge argument]]. Mary knows all the physical facts about colour processing, yet learns something new upon seeing red. The physical facts, however complete, do not entail the phenomenal facts. The same argument applies interpersonally. Knowing every physical detail about another person's visual cortex does not tell you what their experience of red is *like*. You know the functional role, the causal relations, the neural firing patterns. You do not know the phenomenal property that accompanies them.

This is not a problem of technological limitation. A perfect brain scanner that mapped every synapse and every quantum state would still face the explanatory gap. The gap is between categories of fact — physical and phenomenal — not between crude and fine-grained physical descriptions. The [[modal-structure-of-phenomenal-properties|modal independence of phenomenal from physical properties]] provides the formal backbone: phenomenal properties can vary while physical properties remain fixed, and vice versa.

## The Proliferation of Unknowable Differences

The problem extends far beyond colour. Consider:

**Pain.** Two people stub their toes. Both wince, both report pain, both show identical nociceptive activation. Are their pain experiences the same phenomenal property? The behavioural and neural evidence cannot settle this. One person's pain might have a quality utterly different from the other's — a quality for which we have no words because our only access to pain quality is through our own case.

**Emotion.** Grief presents a subtler challenge. Unlike pain, which has a relatively circumscribed functional profile, grief involves an entire constellation — withdrawal, tears, disrupted sleep, loss of motivation — that unfolds over weeks or months. Two people can display the same grief trajectory while differing not just in how it feels but in whether it feels like *one* thing at all. The functional signature underdetermines the [[phenomenal-consciousness|phenomenal]] character at a deeper level than simple inversion.

**Temporal experience.** The flow of time may be the most intimate phenomenal property and the hardest to examine. Everyone reports that the present is vivid, that time passes, that memories feel past. But these reports describe structural features — relations between moments — not the intrinsic quality of temporal experience. If that quality varies between minds, no comparison of temporal judgements can detect it, because temporal judgements track structure, not character.

Each of these cases illustrates the same structural point at a different level. Pain shows that quality can vary beneath identical function. Emotion shows that even complex, extended phenomenal episodes are underdetermined. Temporal experience shows that the most pervasive feature of consciousness — its temporal character — is equally beyond interpersonal comparison. If the Map is right that phenomenal properties are irreducible, the space of unknowable interpersonal differences is vast.

## The Testimony Bottleneck

Language might seem to offer a way around the problem. When someone says "I see red," perhaps the shared meaning of the word "red" guarantees shared experience. But this hope collapses on inspection.

Words for phenomenal properties are learned through public criteria — pointing at objects, associating labels with causes. "Red" means the colour of fire trucks and tomatoes, the thing that activates certain receptors, the property at one end of the visible spectrum. All of these fix the functional role, not the phenomenal character. Two people with systematically inverted spectra would learn to use "red" identically. Their testimony is indistinguishable, but their experiences differ.

The [[consciousness-and-testimony|epistemology of testimony]] hits its limit here. We can trust others' reports about the functional and relational aspects of their experience — they can reliably tell us which colours match, which pains are worse, which emotions accompany which situations. What testimony cannot convey is the intrinsic phenomenal character that accompanies these functional roles. The bottleneck is not dishonesty or imprecision. It is the structure of language itself, which encodes relations and functions rather than intrinsic qualities.

This has consequences for [[consciousness-and-interpersonal-understanding|interpersonal understanding]]. If genuine understanding of another person requires grasping what their experience is like — not just what they do and say — then understanding is structurally limited in the same way that testimony is. We can understand another person's situation, their reasons, their behavioural patterns. We cannot understand the phenomenal texture of their inner life.

## Asymmetry with Self-Knowledge

The problem of other properties acquires its distinctive shape from a contrast with [[introspection|self-knowledge]]. Each person has direct acquaintance with their own phenomenal properties. You know what your red looks like — not through inference, not through description, but through immediate experience. This acquaintance gives you something that no third-person investigation can provide for anyone else's experience.

The asymmetry is epistemological, not metaphysical. Other people's phenomenal properties are perfectly real and determinate. The barrier is access, not existence. This makes the problem of other properties different from mere scepticism. The sceptic worries that external reality might not exist. The problem of other properties grants full external reality — including the reality of other minds — and still finds an unbridgeable gap.

This asymmetry resists dissolution from multiple directions. The functionalist might insist that phenomenal character just *is* functional role — that "same function, different quality" is not a genuine possibility but a confusion. Dennett's heterophenomenology takes this further, arguing that the very distinction between how things "really seem" and how a subject judges them to seem is empty. On these views, the problem of other properties dissolves because there are no intrinsic properties beyond the functional ones we can observe.

The Map rejects this dissolution. The [[knowledge-argument|knowledge argument]] and the [[explanatory-gap]] demonstrate that functional description leaves something out — and what it leaves out is precisely the phenomenal character at issue. Accepting functionalist dissolution requires either denying that Mary learns anything new upon seeing red or claiming that inverted spectra are incoherent. Both options carry a cost the Map's [[substance-property-dualism|dualism]] refuses to pay: abandoning qualia realism. If phenomenal properties are real and irreducible, then unknowable interpersonal differences are genuine, not merely verbal.

A different challenge comes from contemplative traditions. If first-person access to phenomenal properties is itself less transparent than assumed — if careful introspective attention reveals that phenomenal states are less determinate than naive self-report suggests — then the asymmetry may be weaker than it appears. This is a genuine concern, but it cuts both ways: if our own phenomenal states are partially opaque to us, the interpersonal problem only deepens, because even the one form of access we have turns out to be incomplete.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The Map's commitment to [[interactionist-dualism]] makes the problem of other properties acute. If phenomenal properties were reducible to functional roles, the problem would dissolve — same function, same property. But the Map holds that consciousness is irreducible, that qualia are real features of the world beyond physical description. This irreducibility is precisely what generates the epistemic barrier.

The Map's second tenet — [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|minimal quantum interaction]] — adds a further dimension. If consciousness operates at the quantum level by biasing indeterminate outcomes, then the specific phenomenal properties accompanying a given brain state might depend on the particular consciousness-matter interface in that individual. Two brains with identical quantum states could, in principle, be paired with different phenomenal properties if the non-physical side of the interaction differs. The interface is personal.

This connects to the Map's broader recognition that some things may be structurally beyond knowledge. The [[other-minds-void]] and the [[intersubjective-void]] both explore territories where epistemic access fails not through ignorance but through the architecture of reality. The problem of other properties belongs in this family — it marks a boundary that no amount of scientific or philosophical progress can cross, precisely because the irreducibility of phenomenal properties is not a temporary limitation but a permanent feature of a world that contains more than matter.

Yet this epistemic barrier need not be cause for despair. It reveals something important about the kind of universe we inhabit: one where each conscious perspective is genuinely its own, irreplaceable not just sentimentally but metaphysically. The privacy of phenomenal properties is the cost of their reality.
