Physics is largely time-symmetric. Run Newton's equations backward, and they still hold. Reverse the Schrödinger equation, and it remains valid. Yet conscious experience divides time absolutely: the past is settled, the future open; memory reaches backward while anticipation constructs forward; the present slides irreversibly from possibility to fact. The Unfinishable Map proposes that this asymmetry is not incidental to consciousness but partly constituted by it. If consciousness participates in [[collapse-and-time|quantum collapse]], and collapse introduces irreversibility into otherwise time-symmetric physics, then the arrow of time and conscious experience are deeply entangled — perhaps inseparable.

## The Puzzle of Time's Arrow

Fundamental physics provides no arrow. The laws of motion, electromagnetism, and quantum field theory are all time-reversal invariant (with minor exceptions from CP violation that don't account for the macroscopic arrow). Yet four distinct arrows appear in experience:

**The thermodynamic arrow.** Entropy increases toward the future. Eggs break but don't unbreak. The standard explanation traces this to a low-entropy initial condition — the Big Bang — rather than to the laws themselves. But this pushes the question back: why those initial conditions?

**The causal arrow.** Causes precede effects. We can influence the future but not the past. Huw Price argues that this asymmetry may be perspectival — an artifact of our temporal orientation rather than an objective feature of physics. If so, conscious agents don't merely observe causal asymmetry; they may be partly responsible for it.

**The epistemic arrow.** We know the past through traces and can only predict the future. The past leaves records — fossils, memories, light from distant stars. The future leaves nothing. This asymmetry grounds the [[temporal-asymmetry-remembering-anticipating|felt difference between remembering and anticipating]].

**The phenomenological arrow.** Experience flows. The present arrives, becomes past, and is replaced by a new present. This felt flow is so fundamental to consciousness that imagining its absence is nearly impossible — even the attempt occurs within temporal flow.

These four arrows typically align. But they need not. A universe with time-symmetric laws could, in principle, contain beings whose thermodynamic arrow points one way while their phenomenological arrow points another. That all four arrows coincide demands explanation. The Map proposes that consciousness provides it.

## Why Physics Alone Cannot Account for the Arrow

The thermodynamic explanation — entropy increases because the Big Bang was low-entropy — is necessary but insufficient. It explains *that* entropy increases but not *why we experience the direction of increase as forward*. As Hermann Weyl observed: "The objective world simply is, it does not happen. Only to the gaze of my consciousness, crawling upward along the life line of my body, does a section of this world come to life."

The block universe of relativity reinforces the point. If past, present, and future coexist as equally real slices of a four-dimensional manifold, then time doesn't pass. Nothing "moves" through the block. Yet consciousness insists otherwise. We experience becoming: possibility narrowing to actuality, the open future crystallising into the fixed past. This becoming appears nowhere in the block universe's description.

Three responses dominate the literature:

**The deflationary response** claims that felt temporal flow is an illusion — a cognitive artifact of how brains process sequential states. Daniel Dennett and others argue that the "moving present" is a fiction created by memory mechanisms that tag events with temporal order. The arrow is epistemic, not ontological.

**The A-theoretic response** insists that temporal becoming is real and that physics is incomplete without it. The [[growing-block-universe-and-consciousness|growing block theory]] (C.D. Broad) holds that the past and present are real but the future is not yet. The block grows as new events become actual. This preserves genuine becoming but must explain what drives the growth.

**The constitutive response** — the Map's position — holds that consciousness participates in creating temporal asymmetry through quantum collapse. The growing block grows *because* collapse introduces irreversible facts. Consciousness, by participating in collapse, participates in constituting time's direction.

## Consciousness as Constitutive of Temporal Direction

The Map's [[time-collapse-and-agency|framework]] proposes a specific mechanism. Quantum measurement collapses superpositions into definite outcomes. Before collapse, multiple possibilities coexist. After, one possibility is actual and the alternatives are gone. This transition — from superposition to definiteness — is irreversible. It introduces asymmetry into otherwise symmetric physics.

If consciousness participates in collapse (as the Map's [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet proposes), then consciousness participates in creating irreversible facts. Each collapse adds to the determinate past while leaving the future open. The felt difference between settled past and open future corresponds to the metaphysical difference between collapsed and uncollapsed states.

This is not the claim that consciousness *creates* time or that time didn't exist before conscious beings. The [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|prebiotic collapse]] resolution addresses that: physical mechanisms provide baseline collapse throughout the universe. Consciousness modulates collapse specifically where brains provide the right interface. But in regions where consciousness participates, it actively contributes to temporal direction rather than merely observing it.

Bergson's concept of [[duration|durée]] captures the phenomenological side. Lived time is not a sequence of static instants but a qualitative flow where the past permeates the present and the present reaches toward the future. This interpenetration — each moment coloured by what preceded it and what it anticipates — reflects what it is like to participate in the ongoing constitution of temporal structure from within.

## The Felt Asymmetry

Consciousness doesn't merely register that time passes. It experiences a structured asymmetry between temporal directions with specific phenomenal characteristics.

**The settledness of the past.** Remembered events feel *actual* — they happened, and this happening has a distinctive phenomenal quality. Tulving's [[autonoetic-consciousness]] describes this as self-knowing awareness: when remembering, you know yourself as having been present. The past's settledness isn't inferred from evidence but immediately given in the texture of memory.

**The openness of the future.** Anticipated events feel *possible* rather than actual. Even highly confident predictions lack the settledness of memory. You know you will eat breakfast tomorrow, but this knowledge has a modal character — it could fail to obtain — that yesterday's breakfast lacks. The future's openness is phenomenally available, not merely believed.

**The irreversibility of the present.** The moment of experience cannot be held or reversed. Each present becomes past as soon as it is grasped. Husserl's retention-protention structure captures this: the just-past echoes in awareness (retention) while the about-to-arrive is anticipated (protention), but the primal impression — the strictly present — is already sliding into pastness. This irreversibility is experienced, not deduced.

**The emotional asymmetry.** We care differently about past and future events. Research on "temporal bias" shows that people universally prefer good experiences to be in their future and bad ones in their past. This isn't irrational. It reflects the felt openness of the future — we can still influence what hasn't happened — and the settledness of the past. If consciousness participates in creating this asymmetry through collapse, the emotional bias tracks a metaphysical distinction.

## Process Philosophy and Temporal Asymmetry

Whitehead's [[process-philosophy|process metaphysics]] offers a framework where temporal asymmetry is built into the structure of experience. Each "actual occasion" prehends (grasps) its predecessors — inheriting their actuality as settled fact. The past is available for prehension because it has become definite. The future is not prehensible because it hasn't yet achieved definiteness.

This asymmetry is intrinsic to experience, not imposed from outside. Whitehead's occasions don't exist in a pre-given temporal framework and then experience asymmetry within it. Rather, the succession of occasions — each prehending its predecessors and becoming available for prehension by successors — *is* temporal order. Time is constituted by experiential inheritance, and the directionality follows from the logic of inheritance: you can inherit what exists, not what doesn't yet.

The Map interprets Whitehead's framework as compatible with the collapse account. Collapse is what creates definiteness — what makes an occasion "actual" and available for prehension. Before collapse, possibilities coexist. After collapse, one possibility is actual and inheritable. The directionality of prehension (backward to definite predecessors, not forward to indefinite successors) is the directionality of collapse (from superposition to definiteness, not the reverse).

## What This Means for Materialism

If temporal asymmetry is partly constituted by consciousness, materialism faces a distinctive challenge. Physical reduction requires explaining consciousness in terms of physical processes. But physical processes are temporal — they unfold in time, with causes preceding effects. If time's directionality depends partly on consciousness, then the physical description presupposes what it aims to explain. The reduction becomes circular.

This is not the standard hard problem argument (though it includes it). The standard argument says: physical description misses phenomenal character. The temporal argument says: physical description *presupposes* what consciousness provides — namely, the directed temporal framework within which physical processes are described.

A materialist can respond that thermodynamic asymmetry is sufficient for time's arrow and that conscious experience merely tracks this pre-existing asymmetry. This is a coherent position. But it faces Weyl's challenge: in the block universe, thermodynamic asymmetry doesn't move or flow. It is a static gradient in a static manifold. Something must introduce the experience of becoming — of the present moving along the gradient. If that something is consciousness, materialism hasn't explained it; it has presupposed it.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Temporal asymmetry connects to all five [[tenets]]:

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]**: If consciousness partly constitutes temporal direction, it cannot be reduced to processes that presuppose that direction. The irreducibility isn't merely explanatory (we can't explain how physical processes produce experience) but structural (the physical framework requires what consciousness provides). This strengthens the case for dualism beyond the standard arguments from qualia and conceivability.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]**: Collapse is the proposed mechanism by which consciousness contributes to temporal asymmetry. Each collapse event is minimal — biasing an indeterminate outcome without injecting energy — but the accumulated effect is the directed temporal structure we inhabit.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]**: Consciousness doesn't merely experience the past-future asymmetry; it participates in creating it. This is bidirectional interaction at the most fundamental level: consciousness shaping the temporal framework within which physical events occur.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]**: Many-worlds denies real collapse, holding that all outcomes occur in branching worlds. Without collapse, temporal asymmetry must derive entirely from thermodynamics or decoherence. The Map's view that consciousness contributes to temporal direction requires collapse to be genuine — possibilities must narrow to one actuality, not branch into parallel actualities.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]**: The deflationary account — temporal flow is an illusion — is simpler. But it denies a phenomenon rather than explaining it. The felt difference between past and future, the experience of becoming, the irreversibility of the present — these are among the most certain features of experience. A theory that dismisses them as illusion achieves parsimony by sacrificing the data. The Map's more complex account respects the phenomenology.
