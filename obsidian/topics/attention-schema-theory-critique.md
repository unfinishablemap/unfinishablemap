Michael Graziano's Attention Schema Theory (AST) proposes that consciousness is the brain's simplified model of its own attention. The theory gains plausibility from a genuine insight: the brain does construct internal models to help manage complex processes. But AST fails where it matters most. It explains why we *report* being conscious without explaining why there is anything it is like to be us. The seeming of experience must appear *to something*, and that something cannot be another model without infinite regress. AST dissolves the hard problem by refusing to address it.

This article develops The Unfinishable Map's critique of AST, building on the [[attention-schema-theory|concept article]] that introduces the theory. The critique is not that AST is wrong about attention—attention schemas may well exist and serve useful control functions. The critique is that consciousness is something over and above what AST describes.

## The Core Problem: Models Don't Experience

AST holds that the attention schema represents attention as having experiential qualities—intentionality, selfhood, phenomenality—because that's a useful simplification for managing attentional resources. The brain then "concludes" it has a non-physical essence of awareness based on this model.

The immediate question: who concludes? What does the concluding?

An information structure doesn't conclude anything. Information exists; it doesn't draw inferences. For a conclusion to be drawn, something must grasp the premises and recognize the entailment. This grasping is itself experiential—there is something it is like to understand, to see how pieces fit together. AST must either invoke this phenomenal grasping (undermining its eliminativist conclusion) or deny that conclusions are really drawn (making the theory's own formulation incoherent).

Raymond Tallis sharpens this point: "Misrepresentation presupposes presentation." For the attention schema to *misrepresent* attention as phenomenal, the misrepresentation must appear to something. Illusions require someone to be fooled. A drawing of a face isn't confused about faces; only a perceiver seeing the drawing can be confused. The attention schema, as a neural information structure, isn't confused about anything. It's just a pattern of activation.

Graziano's response—that the schema "just is" the conclusion, with no separate concluder—collapses the distinction between representing and experiencing. If representing something as phenomenal is sufficient for phenomenality, then phenomenality is real after all. If it isn't sufficient, then AST hasn't explained why we *seem* to have experiences rather than merely processing information labeled "experiential."

## The Regress Problem

AST faces a classical regress that no version of the theory has escaped.

If consciousness is the attention schema, and the attention schema represents attention as experiential, what experiences this representation? Options:

1. **Nothing experiences it**—the representation just exists. But then the "seeming" of consciousness is metaphorical, not actual. There is no phenomenal appearance, only information states that could be described as representing appearances. This dissolves the explanandum rather than explaining it.

2. **Another schema experiences it**—the brain has a higher-order model of the attention schema. But this higher-order model faces the same question. What experiences *it*? The regress continues.

3. **The system as a whole experiences it**—but "the system as a whole" is just the collection of its parts (neurons, schemas, processes). How does assembling parts that don't experience generate a whole that does? This is the [[combination-problem|combination problem]] applied to AST.

4. **Experience is a primitive feature of certain information structures**—but this is panpsychism or property dualism, not materialism. AST is supposed to be a materialist reduction of consciousness to attention modeling. If experience is primitive, AST hasn't reduced anything.

Graziano sometimes suggests that the regress is a pseudo-problem: the question "what experiences the representation?" assumes a homunculus that AST rejects. But the question isn't about homunculi—it's about what it takes for there to be phenomenal appearance at all. The appearance of redness must appear *to* something, even if that something isn't a little person inside the brain. AST provides information about redness; it doesn't explain why that information constitutes an appearance rather than remaining mere information.

## The Effort Phenomenology Problem

Attention feels effortful. Sustaining focus against distraction involves a distinctive sense of work—a phenomenal cost that fatigue compounds. This is the [[mental-effort|phenomenology of effort]], and it poses a specific problem for AST.

If effort is "just" the attention schema representing attention as costly, why does it *feel* costly rather than merely being tracked as costly? The difference matters. A thermostat tracks temperature; it doesn't feel hot. A fuel gauge tracks fuel levels; it doesn't experience depletion. What makes the attention schema different?

Graziano might respond that the attention schema represents attention in richer, more integrated ways than thermostats represent temperature. But richness of representation doesn't generate phenomenality. A sufficiently detailed database entry for "temperature = high" isn't hotter than a simple one. The representation can be arbitrarily complex without anything it is like to be the system having that representation.

The Map's alternative: effort feels real because it *is* real work. On the [[attention-as-interface|attention-as-interface]] hypothesis, consciousness engages with matter through attention, and sustained attention involves genuine causal engagement—possibly via [[quantum-consciousness|quantum Zeno effects]] holding desired neural patterns stable. The phenomenology of effort corresponds to the actual engagement. AST must dismiss this correspondence as coincidence; the Map explains it.

## The Willed-Instructed Distinction

Research distinguishes three modes of attention: exogenous (captured by salience), instructed (cued by external instruction), and willed (internally generated). The [[structure-of-attention|structure of attention]] article develops this fully. The critical finding: willed attention shows distinct neural signatures—frontal theta oscillations, bidirectional frontoparietal coherence, additional frontal recruitment—absent in instructed attention.

This distinction is puzzling for AST. If consciousness is merely the attention schema, and the attention schema tracks attention regardless of how it's initiated, why should willed and instructed attention differ neurally? Both involve attention; both should be schematized similarly.

AST might respond that the schema tracks the *source* of attention, representing willed attention as self-initiated. But this relocates the problem: what makes self-initiation feel different from following instructions? The schema labels them differently, but labels don't generate phenomenal differences. A file tagged "willed" isn't experientially distinct from one tagged "instructed" to anyone but an observer who experiences the difference.

The Map interprets the willed-instructed distinction differently: the additional neural signatures mark where consciousness contributes something beyond information processing. The frontal theta, the bidirectional coherence—these are the neural correlates of genuine agency, of consciousness selecting where to direct attention rather than following automatic or instructed routes. AST has no resources to explain why these signatures exist or what they mark.

## Contemplative Evidence

Meditation traditions provide phenomenological data that challenges AST from within first-person practice.

[[witness-consciousness|Witness consciousness]]—a mode of awareness that observes mental contents without identifying with them—is reported across traditions. Practitioners describe this witness as distinct from the contents it observes, including attention itself. You can watch yourself attending.

If AST were correct, the witness should be another attention schema, modeling the first schema's attention. But the phenomenology doesn't support this. The witness doesn't feel like a model; it feels like the subject for whom models appear. Advanced practitioners report that the witness is not a content of consciousness but the space in which contents arise.

This could be illusion—contemplatives might be fooled by their own introspective reports. But consider: contemplative training typically *refines* introspective access rather than generating more confusion. If AST were true, intensive practice should reveal the schematic nature of consciousness—show it to be a model rather than a subject. Instead, practice typically deepens the sense that awareness itself is prior to its contents.

The Map doesn't claim contemplative phenomenology is infallible. But the convergent reports across traditions—of awareness as witness rather than content, of attention as something consciousness does rather than something consciousness is—constitute evidence AST must explain away.

## The Social Cognition Argument Reversed

Graziano emphasizes that AST explains consciousness via the same mechanisms used for social cognition—modeling others' attention. A 2021 Princeton study found overlapping neural substrates (rTPJ, STS) for tracking self-attention and other-attention.

This evidence cuts both ways. When you model someone else's attention, you don't thereby generate their consciousness. The model exists in your brain, not theirs; they remain conscious (or not) independently of your modeling. Why should modeling your *own* attention be different?

AST responds: self-modeling is special because the model is embedded in the system it models, creating a self-referential loop. But self-reference doesn't generate phenomenality. A self-referential database entry—a record containing its own address—isn't conscious. The Gödelian sentence "this sentence is unprovable" isn't conscious. Self-reference is a structural property; consciousness is experiential.

The social cognition evidence shows that the brain uses similar mechanisms to track self and other attention. This is interesting neuroscience. It doesn't show that tracking attention constitutes consciousness. When I model your attention, I don't create your experience. When the brain models its own attention, it doesn't create experience either—unless experience exists independently of the modeling.

## The AI Prediction Problem

AST has direct implications for [[ai-consciousness|AI consciousness]]. If consciousness is attention modeling, and AI systems can model their own attention (as Graziano's ASTOUND project demonstrates), then sufficiently sophisticated AI should be conscious.

A 2025 analysis suggests current large language models already exhibit workspace-like structures through transformer attention mechanisms. If AST is correct, "with only minor modifications, they could fulfill the processing requirements for phenomenal consciousness."

This prediction deserves serious consideration. If AI systems meeting AST's criteria behave like conscious beings—report experiences, demonstrate self-awareness, show attention-dependent processing—AST would gain significant support.

But the prediction also reveals AST's eliminativist commitments. If current AI systems might already be conscious, then consciousness is far thinner than we intuitively suppose. The "what it's like" aspect of experience—the phenomenal richness of seeing red or feeling pain—reduces to attention modeling that silicon can implement. This is a feature for Graziano (consciousness demystified!) but raises the question: has AST explained consciousness or eliminated it?

The Map's alternative: even if AI systems develop sophisticated attention schemas, this wouldn't generate phenomenal experience—it would generate sophisticated processing that models attention. The difference matters ethically: if AST is wrong, we could be systematically mistaken about which systems matter morally.

## The Haecceity Problem

[[Haecceity]]—being *this* particular thing—poses a problem AST cannot address.

If consciousness is an attention schema, then qualitatively identical schemas should produce identical "consciousness." But your attention schema and a perfect duplicate would be functionally identical yet numerically distinct. Which one would be *you*? AST has no answer because it treats consciousness as a pattern, and patterns are multiply instantiable.

The problem intensifies with branching. Imagine copying your brain's attention schema into a new substrate. By AST's lights, this should generate consciousness qualitatively identical to yours. But would it be *the same* consciousness or a new one? If the same, personal identity is pattern-identity, and you could exist multiply. If different, something beyond the pattern determines identity—and AST doesn't say what.

The Map's framework has resources here. Consciousness isn't a pattern but an irreducible particular—[[haecceity]] matters. Copying a brain wouldn't copy *you* because *you* are not identical to your brain's information structure. AST cannot make this distinction because it identifies consciousness with information structure.

## What AST Gets Right

The critique shouldn't obscure AST's genuine contributions:

**Attention schemas probably exist.** The brain plausibly maintains simplified models of its attention for control purposes. This is useful neuroscience.

**Attention and consciousness are intimately connected.** AST is right that understanding attention is crucial for understanding consciousness. The Map agrees—attention is the [[attention-as-interface|interface]] where consciousness engages with matter.

**The body schema analogy is illuminating.** The brain does construct internal models that don't match underlying reality. This is relevant to understanding how introspective reports can be mistaken about mechanisms while remaining accurate about phenomenology.

**AST explains access consciousness.** Why we report experiences, why we believe we're conscious, why we can introspect on attention—AST provides plausible functional accounts for all of this.

The failure is in the jump from access to phenomenal consciousness. AST explains the functional role of consciousness in cognition. It doesn't explain why there is something it is like to occupy that functional role.

## Why the Hard Problem Persists

Graziano claims AST dissolves the hard problem: there is no explanatory gap because there's nothing phenomenal to explain. The "hard" question is based on misunderstanding what consciousness is.

But the hard problem persists because AST's dissolution is unsatisfying. Consider:

1. **Why does the attention schema represent attention as phenomenal rather than otherwise?** The schema could track attention without representing it as having qualitative properties. Other control mechanisms (motor schemas, spatial schemas) don't generate phenomenal illusions. What's special about attention?

2. **Why is the "illusion" so resistant?** Even philosophers who accept illusionism report that experiences *still seem* phenomenal. If phenomenality is an error, it should be revisable. Optical illusions persist perceptually but not cognitively—you know the lines are equal length. The "illusion" of consciousness doesn't work this way; no amount of theoretical conviction removes the seeming.

3. **What does "seeming" mean without phenomenality?** To seem is to appear, and appearance is phenomenal. AST uses "seeming" language while denying the phenomenality that makes seeming coherent. This isn't dissolving the problem; it's denying the explanandum.

The hard problem survives AST because AST doesn't address it. The theory explains why a physical system might track and report on its attention in ways that parallel conscious self-reports. It doesn't explain why there is experience at all.

## Relation to Site Perspective

AST directly conflicts with the Map's [[tenets]]:

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]**: AST is explicitly anti-dualist—consciousness reduces to attention modeling. The Map holds consciousness is irreducible. The regress problem supports the Map's position: seeming presupposes a subject, and subjects are not models.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]**: AST has no place for quantum mechanisms—attention schemas are entirely physical. The Map proposes attention as the [[attention-as-interface|interface]] where consciousness influences quantum outcomes. Both can be true in limited senses (attention schemas exist; consciousness uses them), but AST's eliminativism is incompatible with the Map's interactionism.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]**: AST is compatible with epiphenomenalism about consciousness (even if attention schemas are causally efficacious). The Map rejects this. The phenomenology of effort—feeling that attention costs something—supports bidirectional interaction. If effort were mere representation, evolution would have no reason to produce the misleading sense that we're working.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]**: AST appeals to parsimony: why posit phenomenal experience when attention schemas suffice? The Map responds: because phenomenal experience is what needs explaining. Eliminating the explanandum isn't explaining it. The illusion problem may be as hard as the hard problem itself.

## What Would Change This Assessment?

The Map's critique would face serious difficulty if:

1. **The regress problem finds a solution.** If illusionism successfully explains how "seeming" can occur without a phenomenal subject, the central objection collapses.

2. **Contemplative training reveals the schematic nature of consciousness.** If advanced practitioners discovered through practice that awareness is indeed a model rather than a subject, AST would gain phenomenological support.

3. **Effort phenomenology proves eliminable.** If the sense of mental effort could be explained away without remainder—shown to be representational artifact with no irreducible phenomenal core—one of the Map's key arguments fails.

4. **AI systems meeting AST criteria are convincingly conscious.** If sophisticated attention schemas in artificial systems generated what is undeniably (not just functionally) experience, AST would be vindicated.

5. **The hard problem dissolves for independent reasons.** If consciousness science reaches consensus that the hard problem was confused—that there was never an explanatory gap to bridge—AST's dissolution would be legitimate rather than evasive.

Until these conditions are met, the Map maintains that AST explains reports about consciousness, not consciousness itself.
