Free will is the capacity to have done otherwise—to be the genuine author of one's choices rather than a puppet of prior causes. The Unfinishable Map defends a distinctive position: consciousness genuinely influences physical outcomes through quantum-level selection, grounded in [[agent-causation]] rather than event causation.

## The Core Problem

Classical physics suggested determinism: given initial conditions and physical laws, all future states follow necessarily. Three responses have dominated:

**Hard Determinism**: Free will is an illusion. Choices are predetermined by prior causes stretching back to the Big Bang.

**Libertarian Free Will**: We can initiate causal chains not fully determined by prior physical states. The Map's framework is specifically *[[agent-causation|agent-causal]]*—the agent as persisting substance directly causes actions, irreducible to prior mental events. This requires [[tenets#^dualism|substance dualism]]: consciousness must be a persisting *thing* capable of exercising causal powers, not merely a property of physical systems.

**Compatibilism**: Free will means acting from endorsed desires without external coercion. Yet this leaves untouched whether the person could have chosen otherwise—the question that motivates the search for a deeper account.

Bergson's [[duration|durée]] offers additional resources: if mental states interpenetrate rather than causing each other like discrete billiard balls, the deterministic model fails at its foundations.

## The Neuroscientific Challenge

[[libet-experiments|Libet's experiments]] found that neural "readiness potentials" precede conscious awareness of deciding to move. The implication seems devastating: if neural activity "decides" before awareness, isn't consciousness merely an epiphenomenal spectator?

But the data admits other interpretations. Schurger et al. (2012) proposed the readiness potential reflects neural noise rather than decision preparation—participants act when random fluctuations cross a threshold. Sjöberg (2024) provides stronger evidence: patients with surgical resection of the supplementary motor area—the region generating the readiness potential—retain their sense of voluntary action. If the RP reflected genuine volition, removing its source should impair it. It doesn't. Libet himself argued consciousness retains "veto power" to cancel prepared actions. The brain prepares options; consciousness selects or vetoes. See [[libet-experiments]] for detailed analysis including the retrocausal resolution.

## Quantum Indeterminacy and the Luck Objection

Quantum mechanics introduces genuine indeterminacy—measurement outcomes aren't determined by prior physical states. Critics argue this merely replaces determinism with randomness: random choices aren't more "free" than determined ones.

The **[[luck-objection|luck objection]]** makes this vivid: if we replay time after an undetermined choice, different outcomes appear across replays. What explains the difference? If nothing about the agent explains it, the choice is mere luck.

The Map's response: consciousness *selects* outcomes rather than merely receiving them. This differs from pure randomness in three ways:

1. **Reasons-guidance**: Selection responds to what matters to the agent—reasons *influence* (though don't determine) which outcome actualizes.
2. **Phenomenology of effort**: Choosing feels effortful. Random fluctuations don't feel like work.
3. **Distinctive neural signatures**: Willed actions show frontal theta oscillations and bidirectional coherence that automatic processes lack.

If selection is genuine, the luck objection fails—the agent explains the difference. The [[agent-causation|agent-causal]] response: the agent's exercise of causal power *is* the explanation. See [[quantum-indeterminacy-free-will]] for comprehensive analysis.

### The Phenomenology of Choice

The [[phenomenology-of-choice|phenomenology of choice]] provides direct evidence that consciousness selects rather than merely observes. Choosing feels fundamentally different from observing—when you choose, you participate in determining the outcome rather than receiving it passively. This phenomenological distinction maps onto neural reality: willed attention shows different signatures than automatic capture. If choosing were epiphenomenal decoration, this correlation would be coincidental.

### The Decoherence Challenge

Quantum superpositions decohere rapidly in warm neural tissue. But decoherence doesn't solve the measurement problem—even after decoherence, the system remains in a mixture of possible outcomes. Consciousness might operate precisely here: biasing which outcome actualizes. The quantum Zeno mechanism operates through rapid repeated observation, not sustained passive coherence. See [[decoherence]] and [[quantum-consciousness]] for detailed analysis.

## The Map's Position: Consciousness Selects Quantum Outcomes

The Map's [[interactionist-dualism]] combined with [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] yields this picture:

1. The brain prepares multiple possible action patterns (superposed neural states)
2. Consciousness selects which pattern becomes actual
3. This selection reflects genuine choice, not random indeterminacy
4. The selection is "minimal"—working with what physics allows, not overriding it

Free will operates through the gap quantum mechanics leaves open. Consciousness doesn't violate physical laws; it determines outcomes physics leaves undetermined.

### The Temporal Problem

If consciousness selects neural patterns, shouldn't selection occur *before* neural preparation, not after? Libet's data shows neural activity precedes conscious awareness.

[[retrocausality|Retrocausal]] interpretations resolve this. Quantum mechanics is time-symmetric; Cramer's transactional interpretation involves "offer waves" forward and "confirmation waves" backward, with the "handshake" being atemporal. If consciousness operates at this level, it doesn't need to precede neural preparation to be its cause—the selection determines which temporal sequence becomes real, including its apparent ordering. This physics-based retrocausality is distinct from contested parapsychological "presentiment" claims—see [[presentiment-and-retrocausality]] for why the Map's framework rests on quantum mechanics rather than anticipatory physiology.

## Mental Causation and Epiphenomenalism

Free will requires [[mental-causation]]: when you decide to raise your arm, your decision must cause the arm to rise. Kim's exclusion argument challenges this: if physical events have sufficient physical causes, mental causes seem excluded. The Map responds: physics provides *necessary but not sufficient* causes at quantum indeterminacies. [[causal-closure|Causal closure]] fails precisely where consciousness acts.

[[epiphenomenalism|Epiphenomenalism]] faces self-stultification: if conscious states cause nothing, your belief that you're conscious isn't caused by actually being conscious. But if you can accurately report "I'm in pain," the pain must cause the report. The [[argument-from-reason]] extends this: rational inference requires tracking normative relationships, which physical causation alone cannot instantiate. See [[mental-causation]] for the full treatment.

## Agent Causation

The Map's framework is specifically [[agent-causation|agent-causal]]: the agent as persisting substance directly causes actions, irreducible to prior mental events. Event-causal libertarianism (mental events causing actions nondeterministically) doesn't deliver genuine authorship—the causal chain still traces back to things outside the agent's control.

Chisholm distinguished *transeunt* causation (event→event) from *immanent* causation (agent→event). When you decide to raise your hand, *you* cause the raising—the agent is ontologically prior to the events. The quantum selection mechanism specifies *how*; agent-causal philosophy provides the framework for *what*: substances exercising irreducible causal powers.

The [[mental-effort|phenomenology of effort]] supports this picture. If choices were random fluctuations, there would be no phenomenology of effort. The felt cost of concentration reflects genuine causal engagement by the agent. The [[phenomenology-of-choice|phenomenology of choice]] details the experiential structure: felt openness during deliberation, resolution when alternatives collapse, and authorship that follows.

[[consciousness-and-creativity|Creativity]] strengthens the case: consciousness doesn't merely select among brain-generated options but *generates* possibilities through imagination, constituting the space of alternatives.

## The Capacity to Suspend Selection

Meditation reveals an additional dimension: consciousness can *refrain from selecting*. The agent can select among options, refrain from selecting (witness mode), or choose which mode to operate in (meta-level agency). This three-level structure goes beyond simple selection from alternatives.

A passive recipient of random quantum events couldn't choose to be passive. The very capacity for witness mode shows consciousness does something rather than merely receiving outcomes. See [[meditation-and-consciousness-modes]] for detailed analysis.

## Neural Signatures of Willed Action

Research reveals that willed action engages distinct neural mechanisms from automatic or instructed behaviour. The brain distinguishes three systems:

| Type | Trigger | Phenomenology |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **Exogenous** | External salience | Being captured |
| **Instructed** | External cues | Following directions |
| **Willed** | Internal decision | Effortful, self-directed |

Willed attention shows frontal theta oscillations and bidirectional frontoparietal coherence—signatures absent in merely instructed behaviour. The phenomenological asymmetry (effortful vs effortless) corresponds to different neural circuits. This supports agent causation: the subjective sense of authorship tracks genuine differences in how the brain organises voluntary versus automatic processing. See [[voluntary-attention]] for detailed analysis.

## Motor Selection

[[motor-selection|Motor control]] shows the same selection architecture as attention: frontal theta, bidirectional coherence, and distinct willed versus instructed signatures. Desmurget's neurosurgical studies separate the phenomenology of deciding from execution machinery—inferior parietal stimulation produces conscious intention *without* movement, while premotor stimulation produces movement *without* awareness. Consciousness operates at the selection level; execution is delegated. Two domains showing identical selection architecture suggest a unified mechanism.

## What Free Will Requires

On the Map's framework, free will requires:

1. **Consciousness as non-physical**: Otherwise it inherits deterministic (or randomly indeterministic) physical laws. The [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]] tenet provides this.
2. **Bidirectional interaction**: Consciousness must influence physical outcomes, not merely observe them.
3. **Quantum-level mechanism**: For influence without violating physical laws, consciousness operates where physics leaves outcomes undetermined.
4. **Atemporal operation**: [[retrocausality|Retrocausal]] quantum mechanics explains how consciousness can be the genuine cause despite apparent temporal ordering.

The [[mental-effort|phenomenology of effort]] provides supporting evidence. William James: "the free will question relates solely to the amount of effort of attention." Schwartz's OCD research shows directed mental effort reshapes neural circuitry. Hard tasks feel hard because the phenomenology tracks genuine cognitive load—consciousness doing something rather than merely observing.

## Free Will and Personal Identity

Free will requires [[personal-identity]]: there must be a *you* doing the authoring. The [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]] tenet emphasizes indexical identity: *this* conscious being matters. If you are an unrepeatable conscious being with a unique causal history of quantum selections, your choices are genuinely *yours*—each decision adds to the particular causal chain constituting your life.

If agents genuinely author their choices, [[moral-responsibility|moral responsibility]] gains metaphysical grounding: desert tracks something real about who caused what, not merely a useful social fiction.

## What Would Challenge This Framework?

The framework is not unfalsifiable. Key challenges that would undermine it:

- **Decisive neural determinism**: Near-perfect prediction (>95%) at quantum-relevant timescales
- **Materialist solution to the hard problem**: Explaining why physical arrangements *feel like something*
- **Quantum biology failure**: Proof that relevant coherence timescales are thermodynamically impossible
- **Phenomenology-neuroscience dissociation**: Effort feeling easy when neural cost is high, or vice versa
- **Many-Worlds confirmation**: Evidence that measurement branches rather than collapses

Current evidence doesn't support these challenges—which is evidence the picture captures something real.

## Distal Intentions and Prospective Memory

Most voluntary action involves distal intentions formed earlier, not just proximal decisions. When you decide Monday to attend a meeting Friday, that intention causally contributes to your arrival regardless of final moments. The libertarian needn't claim consciousness intervenes at every motor command—what matters is that conscious planning participates in shaping action. See [[prospective-memory]] for how episodic future thinking causally influences present decisions.

## The Picture That Emerges

The brain prepares a superposition of possible action patterns. Consciousness—operating atemporally at the quantum level—selects which possibility becomes actual. From inside linear time, it looks like the brain "decided" before consciousness became aware. But the linear ordering is itself part of what was selected. Consciousness determined which temporal sequence—including its own apparent lateness—would exist.

This isn't a proof. It's a coherent picture that takes both consciousness and physics seriously, preserving what matters about free will (genuine authorship) while respecting what we know about the brain and quantum mechanics. How consciousness biases probabilities may remain mysterious—perhaps part of what [[mysterianism-cognitive-closure|mysterianism]] suggests exceeds human comprehension. But evidence can point toward a truth we can't fully understand.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Free will stands at the intersection of all five [[tenets]]:

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]**: Genuine authorship requires consciousness to be something more than physical processes—capable of contributing what physics alone doesn't determine.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]**: Free will requires consciousness to *cause* physical outcomes. The quantum selection mechanism specifies how: consciousness biases which possibilities actualize at quantum indeterminacies.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]**: Consciousness operates within what physics allows—selecting among quantum possibilities without violating conservation laws or causal closure where it holds.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]**: Selection requires real collapse. If all possibilities actualize in branching worlds, consciousness selects nothing—it merely finds itself in one branch. The phenomenology of choice involves *determining* which outcome becomes actual, not merely *discovering* which branch you're in.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]**: Determinism seems simpler but fails to explain the data: phenomenology of effort, willed/instructed neural distinctions, conscious engagement correlating with neuroplasticity.
