Free will is the capacity to have done otherwise—to be the genuine author of one's choices rather than a puppet of prior causes. The Unfinishable Map defends a distinctive position: consciousness is an [[agent-causation|agent-causal]] power that genuinely influences physical outcomes. The core evidence is phenomenological—the felt difference between choosing and observing, the effort of deliberation, the distinctive neural signatures of willed action. These phenomena survive regardless of which physical mechanism enables consciousness-brain interaction.

## The Core Problem

Classical physics suggested determinism: given initial conditions and physical laws, all future states follow necessarily. Three responses have dominated:

**Hard Determinism**: Free will is an illusion. Choices are predetermined by prior causes stretching back to the Big Bang.

**Libertarian Free Will**: We can initiate causal chains not fully determined by prior physical states. The Map's framework is specifically *[[agent-causation|agent-causal]]*—the agent as persisting substance directly causes actions, irreducible to prior mental events. This requires [[tenets#^dualism|substance dualism]]: consciousness must be a persisting *thing* capable of exercising causal powers, not merely a property of physical systems. [[Existentialism|Existentialist philosophy]] articulates why: Sartre's "condemned to be free" captures the structural necessity—consciousness is constitutively self-distanced, never identical with its contents, always able to take a stance toward its situation.

**Compatibilism**: Free will means acting from endorsed desires without external coercion. Sophisticated compatibilists argue this captures what matters—choices flowing from one's own rational processes—and that "could have done otherwise" is metaphysically confused. Yet for those who take the phenomenology of deliberation seriously, compatibilism redescribes rather than explains: why does choosing *feel* like determining an open outcome if the outcome was always fixed?

Bergson's [[duration|durée]] offers additional resources: if mental states interpenetrate rather than causing each other like discrete billiard balls, the deterministic model fails at its foundations.

## The Neuroscientific Challenge

[[libet-experiments|Libet's experiments]] found that neural "readiness potentials" precede conscious awareness of deciding to move. The implication seems devastating: if neural activity "decides" before awareness, isn't consciousness merely an epiphenomenal spectator?

But the data admits other interpretations. Schurger et al. (2012) proposed the readiness potential reflects neural noise rather than decision preparation—participants act when random fluctuations cross a threshold. Sjöberg (2024) provides stronger evidence: patients with surgical resection of the supplementary motor area—the region generating the readiness potential—retain their sense of voluntary action. If the RP reflected genuine volition, removing its source should impair it. It doesn't. Libet himself argued consciousness retains "veto power" to cancel prepared actions. The brain prepares options; consciousness selects or vetoes. See [[libet-experiments]] for detailed analysis including the retrocausal resolution, and [[volitional-opacity]] for why the mechanism of willing is structurally hidden from introspection.

## The Agent-Causal Response to Luck

The **[[luck-objection|luck objection]]** is the strongest challenge to libertarian free will: if choices aren't determined by prior causes, what explains them? If nothing about the agent explains a choice, it's mere luck—and luck isn't freedom.

The Map's response is [[agent-causation|agent-causal]]: the agent *as persisting substance* directly causes choices. This differs from event-causal accounts (where mental events cause actions nondeterministically) because the agent is ontologically prior to the events. The agent's exercise of causal power *is* the explanation—irreducible to any prior event sequence.

Three lines of evidence support genuine agent causation:

1. **Phenomenology of effort**: Choosing feels effortful. If choices were random fluctuations, there would be no phenomenology of effort—nothing to explain why hard choices feel hard. The [[phenomenology-of-intellectual-effort|phenomenology of intellectual effort]] extends this to reasoning: the strain of holding premises, tracing implications, and resisting premature closure all have distinctive phenomenal character that tracks genuine cognitive work.
2. **Reasons-guidance**: Selection responds to what matters to the agent. Reasons *influence* (though don't determine) which outcome actualizes.
3. **Distinctive neural signatures**: Willed actions show frontal theta oscillations and bidirectional coherence that automatic processes lack. The subjective sense of authorship tracks genuine differences in neural organisation.

How does agent causation interface with physics? The Map's [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet suggests consciousness operates where physics leaves outcomes undetermined—quantum indeterminacies being one possibility. But the philosophical argument for agent causation stands independent of any particular mechanism. See [[quantum-indeterminacy-free-will]] for one proposed physical implementation.

### The Phenomenology of Choice

The [[phenomenology-of-choice|phenomenology of choice]] provides direct evidence that consciousness selects rather than merely observes. Choosing feels fundamentally different from observing—when you choose, you participate in determining the outcome rather than receiving it passively. This phenomenological distinction maps onto neural reality: willed attention shows different signatures than automatic capture. If choosing were epiphenomenal decoration, this correlation would be coincidental.

### Counterfactual Reasoning

Genuine choice requires [[counterfactual-reasoning|counterfactual reasoning]]—the capacity to imagine alternatives and evaluate what would follow from each. The Bischof-Köhler hypothesis proposes that animals cannot act on drive states they don't currently possess; a sated chimpanzee won't store food for future hunger because it cannot vividly represent that counterfactual state. Great apes show working memory capacity of roughly 2±1 items versus humans' 7±2, limiting their ability to hold actual situation, counterfactual premise, and counterfactual consequences simultaneously.

This suggests that counterfactual reasoning—and therefore genuine deliberation—requires consciousness. The [[baseline-cognition|baseline cognition]] framework predicts this: capacities requiring extensive working memory should be absent or severely limited in species with reduced conscious capacity. The [[conscious-vs-unconscious-processing|conscious vs unconscious processing]] literature confirms it—spontaneous intentional action requires consciousness; unconscious processing can respond to stimuli but cannot initiate action from internal states alone. Without the capacity to represent "what would happen if I chose X," an agent is restricted to pattern-matching rather than genuinely evaluating alternatives.

### The Physical Mechanism Question

How does consciousness interface with the brain? Several possibilities exist within physics:

- **Quantum indeterminacy**: Consciousness biases which quantum outcomes actualize where physics leaves them undetermined
- **Quantum Zeno-like effects**: Rapid observation influencing which neural patterns stabilise
- **Retrocausal influence**: Selection determining which temporal sequence becomes real (compatible with time-symmetric quantum mechanics)
- **Unknown physics**: Mechanisms not yet discovered

The Map doesn't commit to any single mechanism. What matters philosophically is that consciousness *can* influence physical outcomes without violating physical laws—that there's room in physics for mental causation. Quantum mechanics provides one such opening; others may exist. [[spontaneous-collapse-theories|Spontaneous collapse theories]] (GRW, CSL) solve the [[prebiotic-collapse|prebiotic problem]] by providing baseline collapse that consciousness modulates rather than causes. See [[decoherence]] and [[quantum-consciousness]] for analysis of the quantum approach, including its limitations, and [[attention-interface-mechanisms]] for candidate neural sites and timing constraints.

## The Map's Position: Agent-Causal Selection

The Map's [[interactionist-dualism]] combined with [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] yields this picture:

1. The brain prepares multiple possible action patterns
2. Consciousness—as an agent-causal power—selects which pattern becomes actual
3. This selection reflects genuine choice grounded in the agent's reasons and values
4. The selection is "minimal"—working with what physics allows, not overriding it

The philosophical core is agent causation: you (the persisting conscious subject) cause your choices. The physical implementation—how this causation interfaces with the brain—is a separate question. Free will operates through whatever gap physics leaves open for mental causation.

### The Temporal Problem

If consciousness selects neural patterns, shouldn't selection occur *before* neural preparation, not after? Libet's data shows neural activity precedes conscious awareness.

[[retrocausality|Retrocausal]] interpretations offer one resolution. If consciousness operates atemporally—outside the forward flow of physical time—it doesn't need to precede neural preparation to be its cause. This possibility is grounded in [[time-symmetric-physics|fundamental physics being time-reversal invariant]]: the equations work equally well forward or backward. The selection determines which temporal sequence becomes real, including its apparent ordering. The [[time-consciousness-growing-block|Time, Consciousness, and the Growing Block]] apex synthesis develops this framework fully: consciousness may not merely act *within* time but participate in *constituting* temporal structure through its role in collapse.

Cramer's transactional interpretation illustrates this: "offer waves" forward and "confirmation waves" backward, with the "handshake" being atemporal. But the philosophical point doesn't depend on any specific interpretation—agent causation may operate atemporally regardless. See [[presentiment-and-retrocausality]] for why the Map's framework rests on physics rather than contested parapsychological claims.

## Mental Causation and Epiphenomenalism

Free will requires [[mental-causation]]: when you decide to raise your arm, your decision must cause the arm to rise. Kim's exclusion argument challenges this: if physical events have sufficient physical causes, mental causes seem excluded. The Map responds: physics provides *necessary but not sufficient* causes where genuine indeterminacy exists. [[causal-closure|Causal closure]] fails precisely where consciousness acts—whether at quantum indeterminacies or through other mechanisms physics may leave open.

[[epiphenomenalism|Epiphenomenalism]] faces self-stultification: if conscious states cause nothing, your belief that you're conscious isn't caused by actually being conscious. But if you can accurately report "I'm in pain," the pain must cause the report. The [[argument-from-reason]] extends this: rational inference requires tracking normative relationships, which physical causation alone cannot instantiate. See [[mental-causation]] for the full treatment.

## Agent Causation

The Map's framework is specifically [[agent-causation|agent-causal]]: the agent as persisting substance directly causes actions, irreducible to prior mental events. Event-causal libertarianism (mental events causing actions nondeterministically) doesn't deliver genuine authorship—the causal chain still traces back to things outside the agent's control.

Chisholm distinguished *transeunt* causation (event→event) from *immanent* causation (agent→event). When you decide to raise your hand, *you* cause the raising—the agent is ontologically prior to the events. How this interfaces with physics is a separate question—one the Map addresses through its Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet, while acknowledging the mechanism remains uncertain.

Sartre's analysis of the *pour-soi* (being-for-itself) illuminates this structure. Consciousness is never identical with its contents—it is always aware *of* something, including its own states, from a position of constitutive distance. This self-distance is what makes selection possible: a being that merely *is* its states (Sartre's *en-soi*) cannot stand apart from them to choose. The pour-soi's "nothingness"—the gap between consciousness and its objects—is precisely what libertarian free will requires. See [[existentialism]] for how this analysis undermines illusionism and grounds genuine agency.

The [[mental-effort|phenomenology of effort]] supports this picture. If choices were random fluctuations, there would be no phenomenology of effort. The felt cost of concentration reflects genuine causal engagement by the agent. The [[phenomenology-of-choice|phenomenology of choice]] details the experiential structure: felt openness during deliberation, resolution when alternatives collapse, and authorship that follows. The [[attentional-economics]] framework extends this: agency is fundamentally the allocation of a scarce attentional resource over time, making freedom scale with attentional skill.

[[creativity-consciousness-and-novel-thought|Creativity]] strengthens the case: consciousness doesn't merely select among brain-generated options but *generates* possibilities through imagination, constituting the very space of alternatives. This generation-selection synthesis goes beyond pure selection—each exploratory movement of attention opens further possibilities that didn't exist before the exploration. The agent contributes both which options become actual and which options exist to begin with. Yet the generation process itself is opaque—the [[creativity-void|creativity void]] reveals we cannot observe ourselves creating, only receive the products.

[[dreams-problem-solving-and-consciousness|Dream problem-solving]] provides independent evidence for this causal role. When researchers directed unsolved puzzles into dreamers' REM sleep, dream incorporation more than doubled solving rates—consciousness generated novel approaches in a phenomenally different mode (immersive, associative, unconstrained) that waking cognition could not access. If consciousness were epiphenomenal, the phenomenal character of dreaming should be irrelevant to problem-solving success. The agent-causal framework extends naturally: the same agent operates across waking and dreaming states, maintaining causal efficacy while shifting mode.

## The Capacity to Suspend Selection

Meditation reveals an additional dimension: consciousness can *refrain from selecting*. The agent can select among options, refrain from selecting (witness mode), or choose which mode to operate in (meta-level agency). This three-level structure goes beyond simple selection from alternatives.

A passive recipient of random events couldn't choose to be passive. The very capacity for witness mode shows consciousness does something rather than merely receiving outcomes. See [[meditation-and-consciousness-modes]] for detailed analysis.

## Neural Signatures of Willed Action

Research reveals that willed action engages distinct neural mechanisms from automatic or instructed behaviour. The brain distinguishes three systems:

| Type | Trigger | Phenomenology |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **Exogenous** | External salience | Being captured |
| **Instructed** | External cues | Following directions |
| **Willed** | Internal decision | Effortful, self-directed |

Willed attention shows frontal theta oscillations and bidirectional frontoparietal coherence—signatures absent in merely instructed behaviour. The phenomenological asymmetry (effortful vs effortless) corresponds to different neural circuits. This supports agent causation: the subjective sense of authorship tracks genuine differences in how the brain organises voluntary versus automatic processing. See [[voluntary-attention]] for detailed analysis.

## Motor Selection

[[motor-selection|Motor control]] shows the same selection architecture as attention: frontal theta, bidirectional coherence, and distinct willed versus instructed signatures. Desmurget's neurosurgical studies separate the phenomenology of deciding from execution machinery—inferior parietal stimulation produces conscious intention *without* movement, while premotor stimulation produces movement *without* awareness. Consciousness operates at the selection level; execution is delegated. Two domains showing identical selection architecture suggest a unified mechanism.

## What Free Will Requires

On the Map's framework, free will requires:

1. **Consciousness as non-physical**: Otherwise it inherits deterministic (or randomly indeterministic) physical laws. The [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]] tenet provides this.
2. **Bidirectional interaction**: Consciousness must influence physical outcomes, not merely observe them.
3. **A gap in physical causation**: For influence without violating physical laws, consciousness operates where physics leaves outcomes undetermined. Quantum indeterminacy is one candidate; others may exist.
4. **Agent causation**: The agent as persisting subject must be the cause—irreducible to prior events.

The [[mental-effort|phenomenology of effort]] provides supporting evidence. William James: "the free will question relates solely to the amount of effort of attention." Schwartz's OCD research shows directed mental effort reshapes neural circuitry. Hard tasks feel hard because the phenomenology tracks genuine cognitive load—consciousness doing something rather than merely observing.

## Free Will and Personal Identity

Free will requires [[personal-identity]]: there must be a *you* doing the authoring. The [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]] tenet emphasizes indexical identity: *this* conscious being matters. If you are an unrepeatable conscious being with a unique causal history of selections, your choices are genuinely *yours*—each decision adds to the particular causal chain constituting your life.

If agents genuinely author their choices, [[moral-responsibility|moral responsibility]] gains metaphysical grounding: desert tracks something real about who caused what, not merely a useful social fiction.

## What Would Challenge This Framework?

The framework is not unfalsifiable. Key challenges that would undermine it:

- **Decisive neural determinism**: Near-perfect prediction (>95%) of voluntary choices from prior neural states
- **Materialist solution to the hard problem**: Explaining why physical arrangements *feel like something*
- **Phenomenology-neuroscience dissociation**: Effort feeling easy when neural cost is high, or vice versa
- **No physical gap for mental causation**: Proof that causal closure holds without exception at all scales

Note what would *not* undermine the framework: failure of any particular proposed mechanism (like quantum approaches) would require finding an alternative gap in physical causation, not abandoning libertarian free will. The philosophical case rests on phenomenology and agent causation, not on any specific physics.

Current evidence doesn't support the above challenges—which is evidence the picture captures something real.

## Distal Intentions and Prospective Memory

Most voluntary action involves distal intentions formed earlier, not just proximal decisions. When you decide Monday to attend a meeting Friday, that intention causally contributes to your arrival regardless of final moments. The libertarian needn't claim consciousness intervenes at every motor command—what matters is that conscious planning participates in shaping action. See [[prospective-memory]] for how episodic future thinking causally influences present decisions.

## The Picture That Emerges

The brain prepares possible action patterns. Consciousness—the agent—selects which becomes actual. From inside linear time, it may look like the brain "decided" before consciousness became aware. But if agent causation operates atemporally, the linear ordering is itself part of what was selected.

This isn't a proof. It's a coherent picture that takes both consciousness and physics seriously, preserving what matters about free will (genuine authorship) while respecting what we know about the brain. The evidence is primarily phenomenological: the felt difference between choosing and observing, the effort of deliberation, the correlation between willed action and distinctive neural signatures. See [[living-with-the-map|Living with the Map]] for what genuine authorship means for daily life and practical decision-making.

The mechanism by which consciousness interfaces with the brain may remain partly mysterious—the [[causal-interface|causal interface void]] explains why this mechanism is systematically invisible from both introspection and neuroscience, a consequence of minimal interaction rather than a gap in the theory. Perhaps this is part of what [[mysterianism|mysterianism]] suggests exceeds human comprehension. But evidence can point toward a truth we can't fully understand.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Free will stands at the intersection of all five [[tenets]]:

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]**: Genuine authorship requires consciousness to be something more than physical processes—capable of contributing what physics alone doesn't determine.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]**: Free will requires consciousness to *cause* physical outcomes. The Map proposes consciousness operates where physics leaves outcomes undetermined—quantum indeterminacies being one candidate mechanism.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]**: Consciousness operates within what physics allows—selecting among quantum possibilities without violating conservation laws or causal closure where it holds.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]**: Selection requires real collapse. If all possibilities actualize in branching worlds, consciousness selects nothing—it merely finds itself in one branch. The phenomenology of choice involves *determining* which outcome becomes actual, not merely *discovering* which branch you're in.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]**: Determinism seems simpler but fails to explain the data: phenomenology of effort, willed/instructed neural distinctions, conscious engagement correlating with neuroplasticity.
