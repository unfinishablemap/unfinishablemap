The Unfinishable Map's dualist framework gains unexpected support from research on consciousness in simple organisms. If consciousness were merely emergent from physical complexity, we should expect a clear gradient from non-conscious matter to conscious beings. Instead, the evidence presents a puzzle: organisms with radically different architectures—302 neurons in a nematode, decentralised nerve nets in hydra, no neurons at all in slime molds—display behaviours that resist easy classification. The distribution problem—why consciousness appears where it does—proves equally mysterious whether we ask about humans or worms. For dualism, this is exactly what we would expect: if consciousness interfaces with physical systems rather than emerging from them, the question "where is the threshold?" may have no principled answer at all.

## The 2024 New York Declaration

In April 2024, over 500 scientists and philosophers signed the New York Declaration on Animal Consciousness, significantly expanding the 2012 Cambridge Declaration. Where Cambridge affirmed consciousness in mammals, birds, and cephalopods, New York extends to "a realistic possibility of conscious experience" in all vertebrates and many invertebrates, including insects, crustaceans, and other arthropods. Signatories include David Chalmers, Christof Koch, Peter Godfrey-Smith, Lars Chittka, and Anil Seth.

The declaration's precautionary stance is notable: "If there's a realistic possibility of conscious experience in an animal, it is irresponsible to ignore that possibility." This represents a shift from requiring proof of consciousness to acknowledging that uncertainty itself carries moral weight. The Map endorses this epistemic humility—consistent with the [[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]] tenet.

## Three Model Organisms

### C. elegans: The Conscious Nematode?

*Caenorhabditis elegans* is the most completely mapped organism in neuroscience: 302 neurons, 8000 chemical synapses, 890 gap junctions—every connection catalogued. A 2023 paper, "The Conscious Nematode" (Becerra et al.), documents striking parallels with vertebrate consciousness:

- Habituation, sensitisation, and associative learning
- Transgenerational memory transmission
- An endogenous opioid system structurally related to mammalian pain pathways
- Response to anaesthetics (isoflurane, ketamine) resembling vertebrate patterns
- Positive Phi (integrated information) values in simplified models

Yet the evidence is equivocal. C. elegans fails trace-conditioning paradigms—a key marker for unlimited associative learning. Its exploratory behaviour resembles a "biased random walk" rather than goal-directed navigation. The paper's central question remains unanswered: "Is there something that feels like to be a worm? Or are worms blind machines?"

### Hydra: Decentralised Experience?

Hydra possesses approximately 900 neurons in a distributed nerve net—no brain, no ganglia, no centralisation. Multiple non-overlapping neural networks control different behaviours: somersaulting, feeding, prey capture. Hydra demonstrates habituation and sensitisation but shows no published evidence of associative learning.

The remarkable finding: nerve-free Hydra can survive indefinitely when force-fed, but lose prey detection and feeding behaviour. The nervous system enables specific capacities rather than creating a general experiential substrate. This challenges assumptions that consciousness requires centralised integration—or equally, that neurons are necessary for all intelligent behaviour.

### Slime Molds: Cognition Without Neurons

*Physarum polycephalum* presents the most conceptually challenging case. This single-celled organism lacks neurons entirely, yet:

- Solves mazes (finding shortest paths to food sources)
- Optimises network routes (recreating Tokyo rail network topology)
- Exhibits habituation (distinguishing harmful from benign substances)
- Stores memory traces in extracellular slime

The question is what this demonstrates. Is this cognition? Is this consciousness? Or is it merely biochemistry that mimics cognitive outcomes without any experiential dimension? The Map's framework suggests distinguishing between *cognition* (information processing achieving adaptive outcomes) and *consciousness* (phenomenal experience). Slime molds may possess the former without the latter—or the line may be impossible to draw.

## The Distribution Problem

The fundamental question raised by simple organism research is the *distribution problem*: why does consciousness appear where it does? Four main positions compete:

**Gradualism** proposes that consciousness increases continuously with neural complexity. But this faces the hard problem at every scale: why does *any* level of complexity produce experience? And how can phenomenal properties come in degrees?

**Threshold emergence** (as in IIT or Global Workspace Theory) holds that consciousness appears suddenly when organisational criteria are met. But this creates an arbitrary boundary problem: why should consciousness appear at precisely this threshold and not another?

**Panpsychist continuity** dissolves the distribution problem by holding that proto-consciousness is fundamental. Experience doesn't emerge; it was always present, merely organised differently. But this faces the [[phenomenal-unity|combination problem]]: how do micro-experiences combine into unified human consciousness?

**Interface dualism**—the Map's position—suggests that the distribution problem may be unanswerable because it asks the wrong question. Consciousness doesn't emerge from physical systems; it interfaces with them. Where that interface occurs depends on features of the physical system that provide the right conditions for coupling. There may be no principled threshold because consciousness isn't a property physical systems generate but a domain physical systems can connect with.

## The Unlimited Associative Learning Framework

Ginsburg and Jablonka (2019) proposed Unlimited Associative Learning (UAL) as an empirical criterion for consciousness. UAL requires:

- Association of compound stimuli across multiple modalities
- Complex motor combinations
- Unlimited associative capacity (open-ended learning)
- Supporting capacities: global broadcasting, selective attention, evaluative system, agency, self-other distinction

On this framework, consciousness evolved during the Cambrian (~540 million years ago) and is present in most vertebrates, cephalopods, and some arthropods (bees, flies). Critically, C. elegans, Hydra, and slime molds all fail UAL criteria.

For the Map, UAL is valuable not as a consciousness-emergence criterion but as an interface-identification tool. It tells us where consciousness reliably *couples with* physical systems, not where it *emerges from* them. The hard problem remains untouched: UAL cannot explain why meeting these functional criteria produces felt experience.

## The Illusionist Challenge

[[illusionism|Illusionists]] argue that simple organism research supports their position: if we cannot determine whether a worm is conscious, perhaps consciousness is not the robust property we imagine. What we call "consciousness" might be a cognitive construct—a way organisms model their own processing—that admits of degrees and borderline cases.

This challenge requires careful engagement with Keith Frankish's sophisticated illusionist framework. Frankish proposes that "quasi-phenomenal properties"—non-phenomenal physical states that introspection *misrepresents* as phenomenal—explain our conviction of phenomenal consciousness. On this view, we're not directly aware of qualia; we have functional states that our cognitive systems model as having qualitative character.

**The scaling problem for illusionism.** If consciousness is an introspective illusion generated by sophisticated meta-representational machinery, the minimal consciousness literature poses a dilemma. A 302-neuron system like *C. elegans* seems an implausible candidate for generating the elaborate misrepresentations illusionism requires. Either the worm lacks the illusion entirely (raising the question of where the illusion threshold lies—the same question as for consciousness itself), or the illusion can be generated by remarkably minimal systems (raising the question of why evolution would invest in illusion-generation at such low complexity).

**The regress persists.** Raymond Tallis's objection—"misrepresentation presupposes presentation"—applies forcefully to simple organisms. For *C. elegans* to be "under the illusion" of consciousness, something in that 302-neuron system must experience the seeming-to-be-conscious. But the experiencing is precisely what illusionism denies. The regress problem is especially vivid here: where, in a completely mapped minimal nervous system, is the meta-representational machinery generating the illusion, and what is experiencing it?

**The zombie reformulation.** Consider a [[philosophical-zombies|philosophical zombie]] *C. elegans*—physically identical to a real worm but with no phenomenal experience. On the illusionist view, there is no difference: all worms are "zombies" in this sense, possessing only quasi-phenomenal properties. But this makes the illusionist position stark. Either nothing has genuine phenomenal experience (radical eliminativism) or the illusion itself requires explaining—and in minimal organisms, the explanatory resources seem too impoverished to support sophisticated illusion-generation.

The difficulty in detecting consciousness in simple organisms reflects our epistemic limitations, not consciousness's metaphysical vagueness. The question "Is there something it is like to be a worm?" has a fact of the matter even if we cannot access it.

## Contemplative Evidence

[[witness-consciousness|Contemplative traditions]] offer indirect evidence relevant to simple organism consciousness through practices that strip experience to minimal constituents.

### Phenomenology of Minimal Awareness

Advanced meditators report states where cognitive content diminishes radically while awareness persists. In Theravāda Buddhism, the progressive jhāna (absorption) states systematically reduce phenomenal content: first jhāna retains directed thought (*vitakka*) and sustained attention (*vicāra*); by fourth jhāna, even pleasant feeling has been refined to equanimity. The formless attainments (*arūpa-samāpatti*) go further—infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness—progressively emptying experience of determinate content.

These states suggest consciousness can exist with far less cognitive elaboration than ordinary waking awareness requires. If human consciousness can persist through such radical simplification, the assumption that cognitive simplicity rules out consciousness in other organisms weakens.

### The Vijñāna/Prajñā Distinction

Buddhist analysis distinguishes *vijñāna* (basic awareness, consciousness as knowing) from *prajñā* (wisdom, discriminative understanding). The Abhidharma traditions analyse consciousness (*citta*) as momentary events accompanied by mental factors (*cetasika*). Crucially, basic vijñāna—the bare "there is awareness"—is treated as more fundamental than the elaborate cognitive processing that accompanies it.

Applied to minimal consciousness: the question for *C. elegans* is not whether it possesses sophisticated prajñā (discriminative wisdom) but whether basic vijñāna—the knowing function itself—is present. A 302-neuron system lacks complex conceptual elaboration. But it might possess the minimal "there is awareness" that constitutes consciousness at its most basic.

### Cessation and Its Implications

Buddhist traditions describe *nirodha-samāpatti* (cessation attainment) where mental activity ceases entirely yet something persists. The Theravāda debates about whether consciousness continues through cessation mirror contemporary debates about minimal consciousness: does awareness require content, or can bare witnessing exist without objects?

Neither observation proves anything about worms or Hydra. But they challenge assumptions about what consciousness requires. If awareness can persist when cognitive content approaches zero in humans, cognitive simplicity may not rule out consciousness in other organisms.

## Process Philosophy Perspective

Whitehead's process philosophy offers a framework compatible with the Map's approach. Every actual occasion—the fundamental units of reality in process thought—has both physical and experiential poles. Complexity determines not whether experience exists but how it is organised.

On this view, the question "Is C. elegans conscious?" may misconstrue the situation. The organism consists of countless actual occasions, each with its own micro-experience. What we call "consciousness" is the integrated, high-level pattern these occasions form. The distribution problem dissolves: experience is everywhere, but unified consciousness emerges only where physical organisation supports it.

This aligns with the [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet. If consciousness interfaces with physical systems at the quantum level, the relevant question is not "Does this organism produce consciousness?" but "Does this organism's physical structure provide conditions for consciousness to interface with it?"

## What Would Challenge This View?

The Map's position would face difficulty if:

1. **Clear threshold identified**: If a sharp complexity boundary were found where consciousness definitively begins, emergence would become more plausible than interface.

2. **Neural correlates prove sufficient**: If specific neural activity patterns were shown to be not just correlated with but constitutive of consciousness, the interface model would be undermined.

3. **Illusionism vindicated**: If consciousness were demonstrated to be a cognitive construct without genuine phenomenal properties, the distribution problem would dissolve along with the hard problem.

4. **Simple organism consciousness confirmed**: Ironically, strong evidence *for* consciousness in C. elegans would complicate the Map's position by suggesting consciousness emerges at surprisingly low complexity thresholds.

5. **Panpsychism required**: If investigation revealed experience in systems like slime molds lacking any plausible interface mechanism, more radical revision of the framework would be needed.

## Relation to Site Perspective

**Dualism**: Simple organism research supports dualism by showing the hard problem is scale-independent. If we cannot explain how human neural activity produces experience, we cannot explain it for nematodes either. The explanatory gap exists at every complexity level—exactly what dualism predicts if consciousness is irreducible to physical processes.

**Minimal Quantum Interaction**: The presence of neurons (and microtubules) in all organisms from C. elegans upward provides substrate for quantum-level interface mechanisms. Slime mold cognition without neurons challenges this picture but may simply show that cognition and consciousness can dissociate—information processing without experience.

**Bidirectional Interaction**: The UAL framework requires consciousness to be adaptive—organisms with UAL use consciousness to guide flexible behaviour. This supports the Map's rejection of [[epiphenomenalism]]: if consciousness were epiphenomenal, its correlation with flexible learning would be inexplicable.

**No Many Worlds**: The Many-Worlds Interpretation dissolves rather than addresses the minimal consciousness question. In MWI, every quantum event spawns branches for each possible outcome—including the quantum events underlying neural activity in simple organisms. There would be branches where *C. elegans* exhibits consciousness-indicating behaviour and branches where it doesn't, all equally real. The question "is this worm conscious?" loses determinacy because "this worm" fragments across branches.

The Map rejects MWI partly because it undermines the [[haecceity]]—the irreducible "thisness"—that makes questions about individual consciousness coherent. If consciousness involves indexical identity (there is something it is like to be *this* particular experiencer), MWI's multiplication of observers creates an irresolvable problem: which branch's version of you is the "real" you? The phenomenology of experience includes the sense of being a single, determinate subject. MWI offers no resources to explain this phenomenological singularity—decoherence selects preferred bases but doesn't explain why experience has a singular perspective. The New York Declaration's "realistic possibility" of invertebrate consciousness presupposes that individual organisms are determinately conscious or not. Real collapse preserves this determinacy; MWI erodes it.

**Occam's Razor Has Limits**: The New York Declaration embodies this tenet. Requiring certainty before moral consideration of animal consciousness would be simpler than the precautionary approach adopted. But simplicity does not determine truth. The declaration's signatories recognise that our uncertainty about consciousness in simple organisms reflects our limitations, not reality's vagueness.
