Every moment of experience falls somewhere on an axis between doing and undergoing. Lifting your arm feels different from having it lifted. Directing attention to a problem feels different from being startled by a noise. Choosing your words feels different from hearing someone else speak. This phenomenological contrast—between agency and passivity—is among the most basic features of conscious life, yet it resists explanation by any account that treats consciousness as causally inert. The Unfinishable Map's framework, in which consciousness genuinely selects among physical possibilities, predicts exactly this contrast: agency feels different from passivity because agency *is* different—it involves conscious causal contribution that passivity lacks.

## The Two Poles

### Agency: The Phenomenology of Doing

At the active pole, experience has a distinctive character. When you deliberate and choose, direct attention voluntarily, or initiate a physical movement, several phenomenal features present themselves:

- **Effort**: Active states feel like work. Sustaining focus on a difficult text, resisting distraction, or holding a decision open all involve phenomenal cost. The [[mental-effort|phenomenology of effort]] tracks real cognitive engagement—hard tasks feel hard because consciousness is doing more, not because the brain generates an arbitrary difficulty signal.

- **Authorship**: Actions feel *mine* in a way observations do not. The [[phenomenology-of-choice|sense of agency]] after a decision—"I chose this"—is a distinctive phenomenal quality absent from passively received outcomes.

- **Directedness**: Agentic experience has a forward-facing temporal structure. You are oriented toward a goal, shaping what comes next. The future feels open, the present feels like a hinge.

- **Counterfactual awareness**: During active choice, alternatives feel like live possibilities. You could have done otherwise. This sense of open alternatives disappears once the decision is made and retrospectively in passive experience.

### Passivity: The Phenomenology of Undergoing

At the passive pole, experience has a different character entirely:

- **Receptivity**: Sensory experience arrives unbidden. The redness of a sunset, the crack of thunder, the smell of coffee—these happen *to* you. No effort is involved in receiving them.

- **Givenness**: Passive experience presents itself as already determined. The world is a certain way and you register it. There is no sense that you could have perceived otherwise.

- **No authorship**: When a memory surfaces involuntarily or an emotion sweeps through you, the sense of ownership is diminished or absent. These are things that happen in you, not things you do.

- **Temporal receptivity**: The passive pole is present-oriented rather than future-directed. You are receiving what is, not shaping what will be.

## The Spectrum Between

The poles are idealised. Most experience falls somewhere between pure agency and pure passivity, and the intermediate cases are philosophically revealing.

### Habitual Action

Typing these words, an experienced writer barely notices the finger movements. Each keystroke was once deliberate—early typing required conscious selection of each key. Through practice, the action shifted from the agentic pole toward passivity. It still feels like *doing* something (unlike pure perception), but the effort and authorship have diminished. The [[implicit-memory|automatisation process]] gradually withdraws conscious contribution while preserving behavioural output.

The [[choking-phenomenon-mental-causation|choking phenomenon]] reveals what happens when consciousness re-engages with an automatised skill. A pianist performing from muscle memory suddenly attends to her fingers and stumbles. The return of agency disrupts the passivity that skilled performance requires. This is strong evidence for the Map's framework: if consciousness were causally inert, its re-engagement with a motor routine could not disrupt it.

### Flow States

Flow—total absorption in a challenging activity—is phenomenologically paradoxical. The agent is highly engaged and performing at peak capacity, yet the experience feels effortless. There is doing without the feeling of doing. The usual markers of agency (effort, deliberate control) are absent, yet the activity is clearly not passive—it is responsive, adaptive, skilled.

Flow suggests the agency-passivity axis is not a single dimension but involves at least two: *causal contribution* (whether consciousness is shaping outcomes) and *phenomenal effort* (whether the contribution feels like work). In flow, causal contribution may remain high while phenomenal effort drops. The [[voluntary-attention|attention interface]] operates smoothly, without the friction that generates effort phenomenology.

### Dreams

Dreaming inverts normal phenomenology in instructive ways. In ordinary dreams, events happen to the dreamer—bizarre scenarios unfold without the dreamer questioning or directing them. Agency is minimal. Yet the dreamer *is* the protagonist, generating the entire scenario from their own mind. The production is active; the experience is passive. This dissociation between generation and experience of agency reveals that authorship phenomenology does not automatically accompany causal production.

Lucid dreams restore the agency pole. The dreamer recognises they are dreaming and begins directing the dream. The transition from ordinary to lucid dreaming is phenomenologically vivid: passivity gives way to agency within the same experiential context, demonstrating that the contrast is real and not merely conceptual.

### Hypnosis and Involuntary Movement

Under hypnosis, subjects report that their arm rises "by itself." The motor output is present, but the sense of agency is absent. Conversely, patients with certain neurological conditions may experience a strong sense of willing a movement that never occurs (the Desmurget dissociation discussed under [[motor-selection|motor selection]]). These dissociations show that agency phenomenology can come apart from the physical movements it normally accompanies—exactly what dualism predicts. If the sense of agency were simply the brain's readout of its own motor commands, it could not be separated from them so cleanly.

### Ownership Without Agency

Anarchic hand syndrome presents a further dissociation: patients recognise a hand as *theirs* (ownership) while denying that its actions are *theirs* (agency). The hand reaches for objects, manipulates tools, even interferes with the other hand—all without the patient's sense of authorship. Ownership and agency, normally bundled together, are phenomenologically and neurologically separable.

This matters because it reveals that the sense of agency is not simply body-ownership plus motor output. Something additional—the Map would say: genuine conscious selection—must be present for full agentic phenomenology.

## What the Contrast Reveals

### Against Epiphenomenalism

If consciousness were [[epiphenomenalism|epiphenomenal]]—causally inert, merely along for the ride—the agency-passivity distinction should not exist. An epiphenomenal consciousness would be purely passive in every case. The fact that experience systematically distinguishes doing from undergoing, and that this distinction correlates with measurable neural differences ([[voluntary-attention|frontal theta]], bidirectional coherence), suggests consciousness tracks its own causal contribution.

The epiphenomenalist can respond that the *appearance* of agency is itself generated by neural processes, with no actual conscious contribution. But this makes the correlation between felt difficulty and actual task complexity a cosmic coincidence. Why would a causally inert consciousness happen to represent exactly those situations where neural processing is genuinely demanding as "effortful"?

### Against Illusionism

The [[illusionism|illusionist]] holds that the phenomenal contrast between agency and passivity is a functional distinction the brain represents, not a genuine difference in conscious contribution. But the contrast survives careful introspective scrutiny. Contemplative traditions, which refine phenomenological discrimination through sustained practice, report that the agency-passivity distinction becomes *sharper* with training, not less. Meditators distinguish ever finer gradations of agency and passivity—subtle intentions, micro-decisions about attention, passive reception during open awareness. If the contrast were illusory, extended scrutiny should erode it.

### For the Selection Framework

The agency-passivity axis maps naturally onto the Map's [[attention-as-interface|selection framework]]. At the agentic pole, consciousness actively selects among options the brain presents—biasing quantum indeterminacies through the [[mental-effort|quantum Zeno mechanism]]. At the passive pole, consciousness observes without selecting, allowing neural processes to unfold according to their own dynamics. The spectrum between reflects degrees of conscious engagement with the physical interface.

The [[witness-consciousness|witness mode]] in meditation demonstrates that consciousness can deliberately adopt the passive pole—observing without intervening. This is not unconsciousness but consciousness choosing not to choose. The capacity to move along the agency-passivity axis at will is itself an exercise of agency at a higher level.

## Disorders of the Axis

Pathological cases illuminate the structure:

- **Schizophrenia (thought insertion)**: Patients report thoughts that feel alien—present in consciousness but not authored by the self. The content is experienced passively despite originating internally. Agency phenomenology has been stripped from what should be an active process.

- **Depersonalisation**: Actions feel automatic, as if performed by someone else. The entire experiential field shifts toward passivity. Patients describe watching themselves act without feeling like the actor.

- **Utilisation behaviour**: Patients with frontal damage act on every object they encounter—seeing scissors, they cut; seeing a pen, they write. The stimuli drive action directly, bypassing the agentic deliberation that would normally intervene. Passivity in the face of affordances replaces active selection.

Each disorder strips away a component normally bundled with agency, confirming that the phenomenology of doing involves multiple separable elements: authorship, effort, control, and ownership. The fact that these come apart under pathological conditions suggests they are genuine features of experience rather than a unified illusion.

## Relation to Site Perspective

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]**: The agency-passivity contrast resists reduction to neural terms. Third-person descriptions of brain activity during willed vs. automatic action capture statistical differences in activation patterns, but they do not capture what it is like to be the agent rather than the patient of experience. The phenomenal difference between choosing and observing is as vivid as the difference between colour and silence—and equally irreducible to physical description.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]**: The existence of a felt agentic pole—and the neural correlates that distinguish it from passivity—supports the tenet that consciousness causally contributes to physical outcomes. The agency-passivity spectrum represents varying degrees of conscious causal engagement with the brain.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]**: The spectrum from full agency through flow to passivity may correspond to degrees of consciousness's influence on quantum outcomes—from intensive selection (deliberate choice) through fluent selection (flow) to minimal or absent selection (passive observation).

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]**: Agency phenomenology presupposes singular actualisation. When you choose, one option becomes real. Many-worlds would make every choice a branching without genuine selection—but the phenomenology of agency is precisely the experience of *making one outcome actual* while others become counterfactual.
