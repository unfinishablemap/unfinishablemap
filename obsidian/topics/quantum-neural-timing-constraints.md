Quantum consciousness theories face a timing problem. Neural decisions operate at hundreds of milliseconds; Max Tegmark calculated quantum decoherence at femtoseconds—a gap of twelve orders of magnitude. If quantum superpositions collapse 10¹² times faster than neurons make decisions, quantum effects cannot influence neural outcomes. Yet this critique depends on specific assumptions that subsequent research has challenged, and different proposed mechanisms have different timing requirements. The question is which physical mechanisms remain viable given what we know about both quantum and neural timescales—and whether The Unfinishable Map's preferred framework, post-decoherence selection, operates at a different level of analysis where timing constraints do not apply.

## The Timing Hierarchy

Understanding the debate requires distinguishing timescales that differ by many orders of magnitude:

| Level | Timescale | Process | Source |
|-------|-----------|---------|--------|
| Tegmark decoherence | 10⁻¹³ s (0.1 fs) | Ion superposition collapse | Tegmark 2000 |
| Revised microtubule | 10⁻⁵–10⁻⁴ s (10–100 μs) | Coherence in microtubule interior | Hameroff 2014 |
| Mesoscopic coherent domains | 10⁻³–10⁻² s (1–10 ms) | Network effects (predicted) | Perry 2025 |
| Gamma cycle | ~25 ms (40 Hz) | Neural binding oscillation | Crick & Koch 1990 |
| Point of no return | ~200 ms | Motor action becomes ballistic | Schultze-Kraft 2016 |
| Motor commitment | ~280 ms | Neural decision signature in PMd | Thura & Cisek 2014 |
| Frontal theta (willed attention) | ~500 ms | Theta power increase during willed attention | Bengson 2019 |
| Readiness potential | ~550 ms | Pre-movement neural signal | Libet 1983 |

The bottom four entries—from 200ms to 550ms—represent empirically established neural timing windows. Any mechanism claiming consciousness influences neural outcomes must operate within these constraints. The top four entries represent decoherence estimates ranging from contested to theoretical. The compatibility question depends on which estimate is correct and which mechanism is proposed.

## Tegmark's Original Critique

Tegmark (2000) modelled ion superpositions in neural membranes and calculated decoherence timescales of 10⁻¹³ to 10⁻²⁰ seconds. His conclusion was blunt: quantum effects are "not likely to play a major role in brain function" because superpositions collapse before neurons can respond.

The calculation assumed standard ion channel superpositions in a thermal environment at body temperature. Given the gap between femtoseconds and milliseconds, Tegmark concluded that invoking quantum mechanics for consciousness was "not just highly speculative but actually inconsistent with well-established physics."

## Revised Decoherence Estimates

### Microtubule Interior

Hameroff's group challenged Tegmark's parameters (Hagan et al. 2002). They argued that Tegmark analysed ion channels rather than the Orch OR model's microtubule sites, assumed superposition separations of 24 nanometers when the theory specifies smaller distances, and used inappropriate models for charge interactions.

Corrected calculations yielded decoherence times of 10⁻⁵ to 10⁻⁴ seconds—seven orders of magnitude longer. Laboratory measurements by Bandyopadhyay (2014) found collective oscillations in isolated single microtubules at warm temperatures consistent with coherence lasting approximately 100 microseconds. These were in vitro measurements; whether such coherence persists in the noisy environment of living neural tissue remains undemonstrated.

This narrows the gap from twelve orders of magnitude to roughly three. Yet even 100 microseconds is far shorter than the 200–500ms range spanning the point of no return, motor commitment, and willed attention signatures.

### Mesoscopic Network Effects

Perry (2025) proposed that individual microtubule coherence times underestimate what the brain achieves. Collective quantum effects across microtubule networks create "mesoscopic coherent domains" with predicted coherence times of 1–10 milliseconds—sufficient to influence neural timing precision. This remains a theoretical prediction awaiting experimental verification.

If confirmed, mesoscopic coherence would bring quantum timescales into contact with gamma oscillations (~25ms cycles) and potentially influence the faster end of neural decision-making. Recent demonstrations that the quantum-classical boundary keeps receding—including [[decoherence-and-macroscopic-superposition|hot cat states at 1.8K and nanoparticle interference exceeding 7,000 atoms]]—suggest that categorical dismissal of such network effects may be premature.

## Neural Decision Timing

Multiple lines of evidence identify the temporal windows within which conscious neural decisions occur—from motor commitment at ~280ms to willed attention signatures at ~500ms before action.

### Motor Commitment

Thura and Cisek (2014) identified when neural populations in premotor cortex (PMd) and primary motor cortex (M1) commit to action. Their findings:

- PMd activity for the selected target peaks ~280ms before movement
- M1 activity for unselected targets is suppressed at this point
- The commitment point is when the neural "race" is decided

This 280ms window represents when motor decisions become fixed in neural activity—the signature of volitional commitment visible in population recordings.

### Willed Attention Deployment

Bengson et al. (2019) examined the timing of willed versus instructed attention shifts. Key findings:

- Frontal theta power increases at ~500ms post-cue during willed attention
- Willed attention is neurally distinct from instructed attention
- Bidirectional frontoparietal theta-band coherence accompanies willed deployment

The ~500ms timing for willed attention's frontal theta signature is later than the ~280ms motor commitment point, placing it closer to the readiness potential (~550ms). This suggests willed attention and motor commitment operate at different stages of the decision process rather than reflecting a single mechanism—though the [[attention-motor-quantum-interface|premotor theory of attention]] proposes they share neural resources despite differing timescales.

### Point of No Return

Schultze-Kraft (2016) identified a "point of no return" at ~200ms before EMG onset. Brain-computer interface experiments showed that movements could be vetoed before this point but not after. Once neural activity crosses the 200ms threshold, execution becomes "ballistic"—no longer subject to conscious override.

This defines the veto window: consciousness can influence motor outcomes up to 200ms before execution, but not after. Any quantum mechanism for conscious selection must operate within this temporal constraint.

## Quantum Zeno: A Different Timing Logic

[[stapp-quantum-mind|Stapp's quantum Zeno model]] operates differently from Orch OR and faces different timing constraints. Crucially, Stapp's mechanism uses orthodox quantum mechanics—no new physics is required, unlike Orch OR's appeal to gravitational self-collapse. The quantum Zeno effect occurs when rapid, repeated observation prevents a quantum system from evolving. In Stapp's framework:

1. Neural systems exist in superposition of firing patterns
2. Mental attention acts as "observation" of these states
3. Rapid attention holds desired patterns stable
4. The *rate* of observation corresponds to felt mental effort

This mechanism doesn't require sustained coherence across the full neural decision window (200–500ms). It requires only that observation events occur faster than the relevant decoherence timescale for each observation. If decoherence occurs at microseconds and attention cycles at milliseconds, consciousness would need approximately 1000 observation cycles per decision event.

### The Key Insight

The Zeno mechanism sidesteps the coherence gap by not requiring continuous coherence. Tegmark's critique assumed quantum effects must maintain superposition for neural timescales. Stapp's mechanism proposes instead that consciousness operates through discrete observation events at neural timescales—each observation collapses and "resets" the quantum state, with the accumulated effect biasing which outcome becomes actual.

This is analogous to taking many snapshots rather than filming continuously. The film requires the scene to persist; the snapshots only require it to exist at the moment of capture. Whether this distinction saves the model from decoherence objections remains debated.

## The Schurger Resolution

Aaron Schurger's 2012 reinterpretation of Libet's experiments removes a separate timing concern. Libet found the readiness potential (RP) begins ~550ms before movement, while conscious awareness of intention ("W" time) occurs only ~200ms before. This seemed to show the brain "deciding" before consciousness knows.

Schurger demonstrated that the RP reflects stochastic neural noise accumulating toward a threshold, not unconscious decision. The RP appears in averaged data because noise that happens to cross threshold gets included in the average. Individual trials show noise, not deliberate preparation.

This "takes the sting out of the Libet argument." Consciousness isn't late to a decision already made—it contributes to *when* threshold-crossing becomes action. The 550ms RP timing no longer constrains quantum consciousness theories because the RP doesn't represent decision timing.

## Which Mechanisms Survive?

Different timing requirements apply to different proposals. The first three are scientific hypotheses about physical mechanisms; the fourth—post-decoherence selection—is a metaphysical interpretation that the timing evidence neither supports nor undermines:

### Orch OR (Penrose-Hameroff)

**Requirement**: Quantum coherence in microtubules long enough for gravitational self-collapse.

**Status**: Originally required 25ms (gamma cycle). Revised to potentially 0.1ms (10 MHz oscillations). Still exceeds confirmed coherence times but within theoretical mesoscopic predictions.

### Quantum Zeno (Stapp)

**Requirement**: Observation cycles faster than decoherence; total observation period matching neural decision windows.

**Status**: Compatible with microsecond decoherence if observation rate is ~1 kHz. This is testable: gamma oscillations at 40 Hz are too slow; higher-frequency neural signatures would be required.

### Synaptic Tunneling (Beck-Eccles)

**Requirement**: Quantum tunneling at synapses fast enough to influence vesicle release.

**Status**: Tunneling is inherently fast (~femtoseconds). The model doesn't require coherence—it proposes consciousness biases tunneling probabilities at individual release events. Timing constraints are satisfied but the mechanism was challenged by temperature-dependence experiments.

### Post-Decoherence Selection

**Requirement**: None for coherence maintenance. Consciousness biases outcome selection after decoherence has already selected the measurement basis.

**Status**: Timing-agnostic. If consciousness operates at the moment of definite outcome determination (the [[measurement-problem|measurement problem]]), decoherence timescales are irrelevant—decoherence determines *which basis*, consciousness influences *which outcome*. This is The Unfinishable Map's primary position.

Unlike the three mechanisms above, post-decoherence selection is not a scientific hypothesis about neural timing—it is a metaphysical interpretation of what happens at quantum measurement. Its timing-agnosticism is not a feature that "survives" decoherence objections so much as a consequence of operating at a different level of analysis. The timing debate asks which physical mechanisms can maintain coherence long enough; post-decoherence selection asks what determines outcomes once the physics has run its course. These are different questions, and the empirical timing evidence discussed in this article bears on the first but not the second.

This must be stated clearly: post-decoherence selection cannot be falsified by timing evidence. That is not a subtle trade-off—it is a direct consequence of the model's metaphysical character. Critics are right that a position immune to the field's dominant empirical objection has reduced empirical content. The Map accepts this cost. The value of post-decoherence selection is conceptual: it clarifies what consciousness-matter interaction would require without making claims about when such interaction occurs in neural processing.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The timing constraints clarify the physical landscape but do not directly test the Map's [[tenets]], which operate as metaphysical commitments rather than empirical hypotheses. This distinction matters: the Map should not claim that its framework "survives" timing objections as though it were a competing scientific mechanism. It was never in the arena those objections address.

### Minimal Quantum Interaction

The tenet specifies the smallest possible non-physical influence on quantum outcomes—not large-scale coherent superpositions. Even if Tegmark's femtosecond estimates are correct for neural superpositions, quantum indeterminacy persists throughout the brain at ion channel fluctuations, neurotransmitter release probabilities, and molecular conformational changes. Consciousness need only bias these micro-level indeterminacies at the moment they resolve into definite outcomes. This is a metaphysical claim about what consciousness does, not an empirical prediction about when it does it. The timing evidence reviewed above constrains which physical mechanisms might mediate such interaction, but it does not bear on whether the interaction occurs.

### Bidirectional Interaction

Motor commitment at ~280ms and willed attention theta at ~500ms are neural signatures of decisions—patterns distinguishing willed from automatic processing. If consciousness causally influences these decisions (rather than merely accompanying them), the influence must occur within the 200–500ms window spanning the point of no return through to attention deployment. The post-decoherence selection model satisfies this: consciousness doesn't maintain coherence across these timescales; it biases outcome selection at indeterminacy points distributed throughout the decision process.

### No Many Worlds

Under the Everett interpretation, all outcomes occur in branching worlds. "Selection" becomes meaningless—every possibility is actual somewhere. The timing debate presupposes that some outcomes become actual while others don't. The Map's rejection of many-worlds makes timing compatibility a substantive question rather than a category error.

## Falsification Conditions

The timing compatibility question generates testable predictions. An important caveat: these conditions primarily test the scientific hypotheses reviewed above (Orch OR, Stapp's Zeno model, synaptic tunneling). The Map's preferred position—post-decoherence selection—is a metaphysical framework that timing evidence cannot directly falsify. This asymmetry should be acknowledged rather than obscured.

**For physical mechanism hypotheses:**

1. **Mesoscopic coherence**: Perry's 1–10ms network coherence is theoretical. If experiments reliably fail to detect coherence beyond ~100μs in neural tissue, mechanisms requiring millisecond coherence (including Orch OR) are ruled out.

2. **Observation rate signatures**: If Stapp's mechanism requires ~1 kHz observation cycles, neural signatures at this frequency should correlate with willed attention and motor decisions. The 40 Hz gamma band is too slow; look for higher frequencies. This tests Stapp's quantum Zeno model specifically.

3. **Timing precision of conscious influence**: The veto window closes at 200ms. If experiments showed conscious decisions reliably influencing outcomes inside this window, the mechanism would require operating at sub-200ms timescales.

4. **Temperature dependence**: Quantum effects should increase with cooling. If brain regions showed *reduced* conscious control when cooled (opposite to quantum prediction), the mechanism would be challenged.

**For post-decoherence selection:**

What would challenge the Map's metaphysical position is not timing evidence but evidence bearing on its underlying commitments—such as a resolution of the [[measurement-problem|measurement problem]] that eliminates outcome indeterminacy, or a demonstration that consciousness plays no causal role in any physical process. These are not timing-specific falsification conditions; they are challenges to the dualist and interactionist framework the Map defends across many articles.
