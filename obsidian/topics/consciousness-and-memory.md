The Unfinishable Map treats memory not as a filing system but as consciousness operating across time. Endel Tulving's hierarchy maps three forms of consciousness—anoetic (unreflective), noetic (knowing), and autonoetic (self-knowing)—onto three memory systems: [[implicit-memory|procedural]], [[semantic-memory|semantic]], and [[episodic-memory|episodic]]. The Map extends this framework to include [[working-memory|working memory]] and [[prospective-memory|prospective memory]], which engage consciousness in structurally distinct ways. The resulting picture reveals that memory cannot be understood without consciousness, that consciousness cannot be understood without memory, and that neither can be reduced to information processing alone. The strongest evidence comes from memory consolidation during sleep, where the brain performs computationally sophisticated binding and integration—yet consciousness disengages, producing a dissociation that dualism predicts and materialism struggles to explain.

## The Tulving Hierarchy as Consciousness Map

Tulving's taxonomy of memory systems is, at its core, a taxonomy of conscious modes. Each memory type does not merely *correlate with* a form of awareness—it *constitutes* one.

**[[implicit-memory|Anoetic consciousness]]** accompanies procedural and implicit memory. A skilled pianist does not reflect on finger placement; the body acts with phenomenal fluency that resists articulation. There is something it is like to perform a practised skill—a qualitative smoothness, a felt ease—even without reflective awareness of the process. The Dreyfus model of skill acquisition traces how consciousness withdraws from explicit rule-following as expertise develops, settling into a mode that is unreflective but not absent.

**[[semantic-memory|Noetic consciousness]]** accompanies semantic memory. Knowing that Paris is the capital of France involves a form of awareness—the *feeling of knowing*—distinct from both unreflective skill and vivid personal recall. Tip-of-the-tongue states, where a word hovers at the edge of retrieval, demonstrate that semantic access has its own phenomenology. Understanding itself feels like something, even when no personal episode is being re-experienced.

**[[episodic-memory|Autonoetic consciousness]]** accompanies episodic memory and its future-directed counterpart, [[prospective-memory|episodic future thinking]]. Remembering a childhood afternoon is not retrieving a file; it is re-inhabiting a perspective, with a felt sense of *pastness* that functions as a temporal quale. Imagining a future event may involve a parallel phenomenal orientation—what the Map's [[prospective-memory]] article terms *futuricity*—though whether this constitutes a genuine temporal quale or a cognitive marker remains debated (the [[autonoetic-consciousness]] article argues against a symmetrical futuricity quale). In both directions, the self appears twice: as the present experiencer and as the remembered or anticipated protagonist.

**[[working-memory|Working memory]]** engages consciousness through active holding and manipulation of information in an experienced present. [[prospective-memory|Prospective memory]]—remembering to act in the future—extends autonoetic consciousness forward in time, programming the interface for future re-engagement.

This hierarchy makes a claim: **the complexity of memory scales with the complexity of consciousness involved.** Systems requiring richer phenomenology accomplish more—episodic memory supports [[personal-identity|mental time travel and personal identity]]; semantic memory supports conceptual thought; implicit memory supports fluent action. Consciousness is not bolted onto memory as an afterthought. It is the dimension along which memory systems differ most fundamentally.

## Asymmetries That Resist Reduction

If memory were pure information processing, certain asymmetries would not exist. Their presence points beyond mechanism.

### The Encoding-Consolidation Split

Memory formation divides into a conscious phase (encoding) and an unconscious phase (consolidation). During encoding, attention determines what enters memory—[[working-memory|working memory]] serves as the interface, holding information in an experienced present lasting roughly 100 milliseconds to 5 seconds. Without conscious attention, encoding fails—inattentional blindness prevents encoding of unattended stimuli even in fully awake subjects, and deep anaesthesia blocks new episodic memory formation entirely.

During NREM slow-wave sleep, the hippocampus replays recent experiences through sharp-wave ripples (100–250 Hz) coordinated with thalamocortical sleep spindles (10–16 Hz) and cortical slow oscillations (less than 1 Hz), gradually transferring memory traces to long-term cortical storage. A 2023 *Nature Neuroscience* study (Geva-Sagiv et al.) provided causal evidence for this coordination: augmenting hippocampal-prefrontal synchrony during sleep through closed-loop stimulation enhanced consolidation measurably. Multiple memory traces replay simultaneously—unlike the [[neural-bandwidth-constraints-and-the-interface|serial bottleneck]] of human behavioural throughput, estimated at roughly 10 bits per second (Zheng & Meister 2025). Cross-memory linking strengthens thematic connections. New memories integrate with existing cortical schemas. All of this without the phenomenal unity, temporal ordering, or attentional selection that characterise waking thought.

This split is puzzling on materialist accounts. If consciousness is identical to certain neural processes, why would some stages of a single memory system require it while others do not? A Global Workspace Theory proponent might respond that encoding requires global broadcasting for attentional selection while consolidation uses local hippocampal replay that does not—but this relocates the question: why does global broadcasting produce experience while equally complex local processing does not? The dualist answer: consciousness participates at the point of selection—choosing what matters, what to attend to, what to encode—and withdraws once the selection is made. The brain handles storage; [[conscious-vs-unconscious-processing|consciousness handles significance]].

### The Manipulation-Maintenance Distinction

Working memory reveals a parallel asymmetry. Storage of information can proceed through activity-silent mechanisms—synaptic traces that maintain content without sustained neural firing and without conscious awareness. But *manipulating* stored content—reordering, transforming, combining—requires conscious engagement. Baddeley's episodic buffer, the component that binds information from different modalities into unified representations, remains the most theoretically mysterious component precisely because Baddeley identified conscious awareness as its principal mode of retrieval.

If consciousness were epiphenomenal, this distinction would be inexplicable. Why would an inert by-product be selectively required for one operation but not the other?

### Choking as Causal Evidence

Perhaps the most striking evidence for consciousness's causal role comes from its *interference* with automatised skills. When experts consciously attend to procedures that have become automatic—a phenomenon called "reinvestment"—performance degrades. A golfer who thinks about their swing hits worse. A pianist who attends to finger placement stumbles.

The materialist can reframe this as neural competition—prefrontal explicit-monitoring networks interfering with basal ganglia automaticity—without invoking non-physical causation. But this redescription does not dissolve the puzzle: it is the *conscious* character of the monitoring that makes it disruptive. Unconscious priming of the same motor sequences does not produce choking. If consciousness were epiphenomenal, attending to an automatic skill could not affect its execution. The fact that conscious attention reliably disrupts procedural performance demonstrates that consciousness causally penetrates motor systems—a case the Map examines in detail in [[choking-phenomenon-mental-causation]].

## Why Consciousness Must Withdraw for Consolidation

The standard explanation for why consolidation occurs during sleep invokes neural resource competition: the brain cannot simultaneously process external input and reorganise internal representations. This is true as far as it goes, but it misses the deeper puzzle. Consolidation does not merely require reduced sensory input—it appears to require reduced *consciousness*. Meta-analytic evidence on targeted memory reactivation (TMR) finds that cueing memory during sleep enhances consolidation specifically during NREM stages, with no statistically reliable benefit during REM sleep or wakefulness—though the authors caution that REM and wakefulness studies remain limited in number (Hu et al. 2020; Cellini & Capuozzo 2018).

The Map's [[attention-as-interface|interface hypothesis]] offers an explanation. If consciousness engages with the brain through attention-mediated selection, this selection mechanism imposes a serial bottleneck. Waking consciousness processes approximately one thing at a time, choosing what to attend to and thereby collapsing alternatives. Memory consolidation requires the opposite: parallel processing across many memory traces without selective collapse. The consciousness channel must disengage not because its resources are needed elsewhere, but because its mode of operation—serial selection—is incompatible with the parallel integration consolidation requires.

## Binding Without Unity

The [[binding-problem|binding problem]] asks how distributed neural activity produces unified experience. Memory consolidation during sleep introduces a revealing variation: how can binding operations proceed *without* producing unified experience?

During waking, binding and phenomenal unity co-occur. Seeing a red ball involves binding colour, shape, location, and movement into a unified percept. During sleep consolidation, analogous binding operations occur—linking spatial context to emotional tone, integrating a new memory with existing schemas, relating episodic details to semantic structures—but without generating unified experience.

This reveals that "binding" conflates two distinct phenomena. **Computational binding** is the neural process of linking distributed information into functional wholes. **Phenomenal binding** is the experiential unification of those wholes into something it is like to undergo. Sleep consolidation demonstrates that the first can occur without the second. The brain can integrate information across memory traces, build cross-memory connections, and update schemas—all binding operations—without the unity characteristic of conscious experience.

For the Map, this is exactly what the interface model predicts. Phenomenal unity is not a product of computational binding; it is a product of consciousness engaging with computationally bound representations through the [[attention-as-interface|attention interface]]. When the interface is offline, binding proceeds at the computational level without phenomenal accompaniment.

## Interface Modes Across Sleep Stages

Sleep consolidation suggests the consciousness-brain interface has distinct modes:

**Waking mode**: Serial selection through attention. One stream of experience at a time. High phenomenal unity. Essential for encoding, decision-making, and action in the present.

**NREM mode**: Interface disengaged. Parallel processing across multiple memory traces. No phenomenal unity. Essential for consolidation, schema integration, and synaptic homeostasis.

**REM mode**: Partial interface re-engagement. Vivid phenomenal experience returns, but without metacognitive control. This may serve emotional memory processing—the interface provides enough engagement for affective colouring without the executive oversight that would interfere with emotional integration.

**Lucid REM mode**: Fuller interface engagement within the sleeping brain. Metacognitive awareness returns; the dreamer can exercise intentional control. This demonstrates the interface is not simply switched on or off by sleep architecture—it can be variably engaged, and its engagement can be trained.

The graduated nature of these modes complicates materialist identification of consciousness with any single neural process. Consciousness modulates continuously through states, with different components engaging and disengaging independently. This decomposability suggests that what we call "consciousness" is not one thing but a family of capacities—each with its own relationship to the underlying neural substrate, each capable of independent modulation at the interface.

## The Memory Void and Qualia Persistence

The [[memory-void|memory void]] asks whether past experiences are genuinely recoverable or irrecoverably lost. Evidence overwhelmingly favours the simulationist view: remembering is reconstruction, not retrieval. Each act of recall generates a new experience rather than accessing a stored original. Memories are modified by every retrieval, contaminated by subsequent experience, and shaped by present emotional states.

For dualism, this creates both a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge: if qualia cannot persist as stored traces, what is the relationship between present experience and its physical encoding? Propositional content—the *that* of what happened—survives in neural traces. Phenomenal content—*what it was like*—does not seem to persist as such.

The opportunity: this is exactly what dualism predicts. If qualia are not identical to physical states, there is no reason to expect them to persist when the physical substrate changes. The information is preserved; the experience is not. Materialists must explain why a supposedly physical phenomenon (conscious experience) fails to persist in the way other physical states do. Dualists have a ready answer: phenomenal properties are not the kind of thing that gets stored in synapses.

Proustian moments—involuntary memories triggered by sensory cues that seem to recover the *feel* of past experience—test this boundary. Do they genuinely access past qualia, or do they generate exceptionally vivid simulations? The question may be unanswerable, which places it squarely in the territory of the [[memory-void]] and the [[past-self-void]]: a genuine limit on what consciousness can know about its own history.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Memory provides some of the Map's strongest evidence for its foundational commitments.

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]** is supported by the encoding-consolidation dissociation and the irreducible phenomenology that distinguishes each memory system. Both encoding and consolidation involve binding operations—linking distributed information into functional wholes—yet consciousness is present during encoding and absent during consolidation. The materialist can point to neuromodulatory differences between the two states, but this relocates rather than resolves the question: why should acetylcholine levels determine the presence or absence of experience? Meanwhile, the difference between anoetic, noetic, and autonoetic consciousness is not a difference in information content—it is a difference in *what it is like*. A materialist account must explain why functionally similar retrieval processes feel radically different depending on memory type.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional interaction]]** is demonstrated by the manipulation-maintenance asymmetry, the choking phenomenon, and attention's gating role in encoding. Consciousness selectively participates in memory operations—required for encoding and manipulation, unnecessary for storage and consolidation, and capable of disrupting automatised procedures. The TMR literature confirms this causally: cued reactivation during sleep can enhance specific memories, but the initial attentional selection during waking determines which memories enter the system at all.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal quantum interaction]]** is consistent with the dissociation observed here. If consciousness influences the brain through a minimal interaction mechanism, NREM consolidation represents a state where that influence is withdrawn—the brain processes memories through endogenous replay without any non-physical contribution. Whatever form the interaction takes, sleep consolidation demonstrates that the brain has a fully autonomous processing mode that does not require it.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]** is implicitly at stake whenever the analysis invokes "selection" and "collapsing alternatives." On many-worlds, all alternatives are realised in parallel branches, and the serial/parallel distinction during sleep versus waking would reflect branch structure rather than collapse. The Map's framework requires genuine collapse—consciousness selecting one outcome from among genuinely open possibilities.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor has limits]]** when applied to memory and consciousness. The "simpler" materialist story—that memory is computation and consciousness is epiphenomenal—cannot explain why consciousness is required for some memory operations and not others, why different memory types feel qualitatively different, or why conscious attention can degrade automatic performance. The sheer complexity of consolidation neuroscience—three interleaved oscillatory systems, stage-dependent contributions, variable consciousness states—dissolves the apparent parsimony of "consciousness is just brain activity."
