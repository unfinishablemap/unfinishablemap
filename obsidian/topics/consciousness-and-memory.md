The Unfinishable Map treats memory not as a filing system but as consciousness operating across time. The five major memory systems—[[implicit-memory|implicit]], [[semantic-memory|semantic]], [[episodic-memory|episodic]], [[working-memory|working]], and [[prospective-memory|prospective]]—each involve a distinct mode of conscious experience. This hierarchy, first articulated by Endel Tulving, maps anoetic (unreflective), noetic (knowing), and autonoetic (self-knowing) consciousness onto different memory operations. The mapping is not coincidental. It reveals that memory cannot be understood without consciousness, that consciousness cannot be understood without memory, and that neither can be reduced to information processing alone.

## The Tulving Hierarchy as Consciousness Map

Tulving's taxonomy of memory systems is, at its core, a taxonomy of conscious modes. Each memory type does not merely *correlate with* a form of awareness—it *constitutes* one.

**[[implicit-memory|Anoetic consciousness]]** accompanies procedural and implicit memory. A skilled pianist does not reflect on finger placement; the body acts with phenomenal fluency that resists articulation. This is not unconsciousness. There is something it is like to perform a practised skill—a qualitative smoothness, a felt ease—even without reflective awareness of the process. The Dreyfus model of skill acquisition traces how consciousness withdraws from explicit rule-following as expertise develops, settling into a mode that is unreflective but not absent.

**[[semantic-memory|Noetic consciousness]]** accompanies semantic memory. Knowing that Paris is the capital of France involves a form of awareness—the *feeling of knowing*—distinct from both unreflective skill and vivid personal recall. Tip-of-the-tongue states, where a word hovers at the edge of retrieval, demonstrate that semantic access has its own phenomenology. Understanding itself feels like something, even when no personal episode is being re-experienced.

**[[episodic-memory|Autonoetic consciousness]]** accompanies episodic memory and its future-directed counterpart, [[prospective-memory|episodic future thinking]]. Remembering a childhood afternoon is not retrieving a file; it is re-inhabiting a perspective, with a felt sense of *pastness* that functions as a temporal quale. Imagining a future event involves a parallel *futuricity*—a phenomenal orientation toward what has not yet occurred. In both directions, the self appears twice: as the present experiencer and as the remembered or anticipated protagonist.

This hierarchy is not merely classificatory. It makes a claim: **the complexity of memory scales with the complexity of consciousness involved.** Systems requiring richer phenomenology accomplish more—episodic memory supports mental time travel and personal identity; semantic memory supports conceptual thought and understanding; implicit memory supports fluent action. Consciousness is not bolted onto memory as an afterthought. It is the dimension along which memory systems differ most fundamentally.

## Asymmetries That Resist Reduction

If memory were pure information processing, certain asymmetries would not exist. Their presence points beyond mechanism.

### The Encoding-Consolidation Gap

Memory formation splits into a conscious phase (encoding) and an unconscious phase (consolidation). During encoding, attention determines what enters memory—[[working-memory|working memory]] serves as the interface, holding information in an experienced present lasting roughly 100 milliseconds to 5 seconds. During sleep, the hippocampus replays memories through sharp-wave ripples coordinated with thalamocortical spindles and cortical slow oscillations, transferring information to long-term storage without conscious involvement.

This split is puzzling on materialist accounts. If consciousness is identical to certain neural processes, why would some stages of a single memory system require it while others do not? The dualist answer: consciousness participates at the point of selection—choosing what matters, what to attend to, what to encode—and withdraws once the selection is made. The brain handles storage; consciousness handles significance.

### The Manipulation-Maintenance Distinction

Working memory reveals a parallel asymmetry. Storage of information can proceed through activity-silent mechanisms—synaptic traces that maintain content without sustained neural firing and without conscious awareness. But *manipulating* stored content—reordering, transforming, combining—requires conscious engagement. Baddeley's episodic buffer, the component that binds information from different modalities into coherent experience, remains the most theoretically mysterious component precisely because its function appears inseparable from consciousness itself.

This distinction matters because it identifies *where* consciousness contributes. Not in passive holding, which neural systems manage independently, but in active transformation—the operations that generate novel combinations and enable flexible thought. If consciousness were epiphenomenal, the manipulation-maintenance distinction would be inexplicable. Why would an inert by-product be selectively required for one operation but not the other?

### Choking as Causal Evidence

Perhaps the most striking evidence for consciousness's causal role comes from its *interference* with automatised skills. When experts consciously attend to procedures that have become automatic—a phenomenon called "reinvestment"—performance degrades. A golfer who thinks about their swing hits worse. A pianist who attends to finger placement stumbles.

This is bidirectional interaction in action. If consciousness were epiphenomenal, attending to an automatic skill could not affect its execution. The fact that conscious attention reliably disrupts procedural performance demonstrates that consciousness causally penetrates motor systems. Consciousness is not merely tracking what the body does; it is capable of disrupting what the body does, which means it is part of the causal chain.

## Memory Formation and the Binding Problem

Every act of encoding requires binding—linking disparate sensory features into a unified experience that can later be retrieved as a whole. The hippocampus performs this binding for episodic memory, creating conjunctive representations that link spatial, temporal, and sensory elements. During sleep consolidation, binding operations continue—integrating new memories with existing schemas, linking across memory traces—but without the phenomenal unity that characterises waking experience.

This raises a question the binding problem makes sharp: what produces *unified* experience from distributed neural activity during waking, and why does its absence during sleep not prevent binding operations? The Map's answer appeals to consciousness as the unifying factor. Neural binding produces functional integration; consciousness produces phenomenal unity. Sleep demonstrates that one can occur without the other, which is precisely what dualism predicts—the two are not identical.

The hippocampus binds *features*. Consciousness binds *experience*. These are not the same operation described at different levels—they are distinct processes that normally co-occur during waking life and come apart during sleep. The fact that they can come apart is evidence that phenomenal unity is not reducible to neural binding.

## The Memory Void and Qualia Persistence

The [[memory-void|memory void]] asks whether past experiences are genuinely recoverable or irrecoverably lost. Evidence overwhelmingly favours the simulationist view: remembering is reconstruction, not retrieval. Each act of recall generates a new experience rather than accessing a stored original. Memories are modified by every retrieval, contaminated by subsequent experience, and shaped by present emotional states.

For dualism, this creates both a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge: if qualia cannot persist as stored traces, what is the relationship between present experience and its physical encoding? Propositional content—the *that* of what happened—survives in neural traces. Phenomenal content—*what it was like*—does not seem to persist as such.

The opportunity: this is exactly what dualism predicts. If qualia are not identical to physical states, there is no reason to expect them to persist when the physical substrate changes. The information is preserved; the experience is not. Materialists must explain why a supposedly physical phenomenon (conscious experience) fails to persist in the way other physical states do. Dualists have a ready answer: phenomenal properties are not the kind of thing that gets stored in synapses.

Proustian moments—involuntary memories triggered by sensory cues that seem to recover the *feel* of past experience—test this boundary. Do they genuinely access past qualia, or do they generate exceptionally vivid simulations? The question may be unanswerable, which places it squarely in the territory of the [[memory-void]]: a genuine limit on what consciousness can know about its own history.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Memory provides some of the Map's strongest evidence for its foundational commitments.

**Dualism** finds support in the irreducible phenomenology that distinguishes each memory system. The difference between anoetic, noetic, and autonoetic consciousness is not a difference in information content—it is a difference in *what it is like*. A materialist account must explain why functionally similar retrieval processes feel radically different depending on memory type. The dualist has a natural explanation: different modes of consciousness are different phenomenal realities, not different computational routines.

**Bidirectional interaction** is demonstrated by the manipulation-maintenance asymmetry and the choking phenomenon. Consciousness selectively participates in memory operations—required for encoding and manipulation, unnecessary for storage and consolidation, and capable of disrupting automatised procedures. This pattern of selective engagement and causal efficacy is precisely what the Map's interface model predicts.

**Occam's Razor has limits** when applied to memory and consciousness. The "simpler" materialist story—that memory is computation and consciousness is epiphenomenal—cannot explain why consciousness is required for some memory operations and not others, why different memory types feel qualitatively different, or why conscious attention can degrade automatic performance. The apparently more complex dualist account is more explanatory.

The Tulving hierarchy, read through the Map's lens, suggests that consciousness is not a single capacity that memory sometimes uses. It is a graded phenomenon with distinct modes, each enabling different cognitive achievements. Memory systems are not merely *accompanied by* different kinds of consciousness—they are *constituted by* them. Remove the phenomenology and you do not have the same memory system operating in the dark. You have a different system entirely.
