Four serious proposals compete to explain how consciousness interfaces with quantum mechanics: Penrose-Hameroff's Orchestrated Objective Reduction, Stapp's quantum Zeno model, Fisher's nuclear spin hypothesis, and spontaneous collapse hybrids (notably McQueen's CSL-IIT). Each claims to solve the same puzzle — how a non-physical mind influences physical outcomes without violating conservation laws — but they locate the interface at different scales, invoke different physics, and carry different empirical and philosophical commitments. The Unfinishable Map does not commit to any single mechanism, but evaluating them against shared criteria reveals which approaches best fit the Map's [[tenets]] and which face the steepest obstacles.

## Evaluation Criteria

Five criteria structure this comparison:

1. **Decoherence vulnerability** — Does the mechanism require sustained quantum coherence in warm neural tissue, or can it operate through discrete events that sidestep the timing gap?
2. **Phenomenological fit** — Does the mechanism's structure match what consciousness actually feels like: effortful attention, unified experience, the willed/automatic distinction?
3. **Tenet alignment** — How well does the mechanism satisfy all five of the Map's commitments, particularly [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]?
4. **Empirical status** — What experimental evidence supports (or constrains) the proposal as of 2025?
5. **Falsifiability** — Does the mechanism generate predictions that could distinguish it from competitors?

## Orch OR: Gravitational Collapse in Microtubules

Penrose and Hameroff propose that tubulin proteins in microtubules sustain quantum superpositions that collapse when gravitational self-energy reaches a threshold (t = ħ/E_G). Each collapse event constitutes a discrete moment of conscious experience. The "orchestration" comes from entanglement across microtubule networks, coordinated by synaptic inputs and gap junctions.

**Decoherence vulnerability: High.** Orch OR requires sustained superposition across many tubulin dimers until gravitational threshold is reached. Even revised coherence estimates (10⁻⁵ seconds per Hagan et al. 2002) leave a three-order-of-magnitude gap below neural decision timescales (~300ms). The mechanism cannot sidestep this by invoking discrete events — it fundamentally requires continuous quantum computation.

**Phenomenological fit: Partial.** Orch OR maps each collapse to a "moment of consciousness," which loosely matches the temporal grain of experience. But it struggles to explain why attention feels effortful — gravitational collapse is automatic once threshold is reached, leaving no obvious role for felt effort. The mechanism explains *that* consciousness occurs but not *why* it has the phenomenological character it does.

**Tenet alignment: Mixed.** Orch OR supports [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]] (consciousness irreducible to classical computation, via Penrose's Gödelian argument) and [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] (collapse as causal mechanism). It supports [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]] (objective collapse). However, it sits uneasily with [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]. The tenet requires the *smallest possible* non-physical influence — but Orch OR demands macroscopic quantum coherence across microtubule networks. Penrose's suggestion that each OR event carries proto-conscious experience implies a form of panpsychism the Map does not endorse.

**Empirical status: Growing but contested.** The 2024 epothilone B study (microtubule-stabilizing drug delays anaesthesia) and room-temperature tryptophan superradiance provide circumstantial support. Wiest et al. (2025) report a 613 THz quantum oscillation signature abolished by anaesthetics. These findings establish microtubule relevance to consciousness but do not confirm the specific Orch OR mechanism — microtubules might matter for classical or other quantum reasons.

**Falsifiability: Moderate.** Orch OR predicts measurable quantum coherence in microtubules at specific timescales and gravitational collapse at specific mass thresholds. Germanium detector experiments (2022) have already ruled out the simplest Diósi-Penrose model. The parameter space is shrinking — a virtue for falsifiability, but a warning for the theory.

## Stapp's Quantum Zeno Model: Attention as Observation

Henry Stapp proposes that consciousness operates through orthodox quantum mechanics. Multiple neural firing patterns exist in superposition; mental effort acts as repeated quantum observation, exploiting the Zeno effect to hold desired patterns stable. No new physics is required — the mechanism uses standard von Neumann quantum mechanics with the observer-system boundary placed within the brain.

**Decoherence vulnerability: Low.** This is the Zeno model's decisive advantage. It requires only discrete observation events, not sustained coherence. Each observation is effectively instantaneous; the accumulated effect of ~1000 observations over a 300ms window biases which neural pattern actualises. Decoherence between observations doesn't invalidate the mechanism — it simply resets the state, and the next observation re-engages. The 2024 demonstration that biological systems use the quantum Zeno effect (cryptochrome radical pairs, Atkins et al.) provides direct precedent.

**Phenomenological fit: Strong.** The model predicts exactly what attention feels like: sustained effort, continuous re-engagement, fatigue from prolonged concentration. William James observed that "sustained voluntary attention is a repetition of successive efforts" — precisely the phenomenology the Zeno mechanism predicts. The willed/automatic distinction maps naturally: willed attention requires conscious observation (high Zeno rate), while automatic processes proceed without it. Schwartz's neuroplasticity findings — OCD patients reshaping brain circuits through directed mental effort — provide empirical support for the phenomenological prediction.

**Tenet alignment: Strong.** Stapp's model satisfies all five tenets. It requires a non-physical observer ([[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]). It operates at quantum indeterminacies without energy injection ([[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]). It enables downward causation ([[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]). It requires genuine collapse, not branching ([[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]). And its departure from materialist neuroscience illustrates that simplicity can mislead ([[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]).

**Empirical status: Indirect but converging.** No experiment has directly demonstrated the Zeno mechanism in neural tissue. However, supporting evidence accumulates from multiple directions: biological Zeno precedent (cryptochrome), neural signatures distinguishing willed from instructed attention (frontal theta, bidirectional frontoparietal coherence), and neuroplasticity from directed effort. The Monte Carlo critique (2024) questions whether Zeno remains robust beyond brain decoherence timescales unless consciousness acts globally — an open question.

**Falsifiability: Strong.** The model predicts: willed and instructed attention should show distinct neural signatures (confirmed); effort phenomenology should track cognitive difficulty (confirmed); neuroplasticity should require conscious engagement (supported but not definitive). If the willed/instructed distinction proved artifactual, or if neuroplasticity occurred equally under anaesthesia, the model would face serious difficulty.

## Fisher's Nuclear Spin Hypothesis: Posner Molecule Entanglement

Matthew Fisher proposes that phosphorus-31 nuclear spins in Posner molecules (Ca₉(PO₄)₆) serve as biological qubits. Enzymatic reactions during ATP hydrolysis create entangled phosphate pairs; these incorporate into Posner molecules that protect nuclear spin coherence for potentially hours; when Posner molecules enter neurons and release calcium, entangled states influence neural firing.

**Decoherence vulnerability: Very low.** Nuclear spins couple extremely weakly to thermal environments. Fisher estimates coherence times of ~10⁵ seconds (over a day). Even conservative estimates (Player and Hore suggest ~37 minutes) vastly exceed neural decision timescales. This mechanism faces the *opposite* problem from Orch OR: coherence may be too easy, raising the question of why these quantum effects aren't observed everywhere.

**Phenomenological fit: Weak.** Fisher's mechanism operates on timescales of minutes to hours — far longer than the millisecond-to-second grain of conscious experience. It provides no obvious account of why attention feels effortful, why consciousness has temporal unity at the scale it does, or why the willed/automatic distinction exists. The mechanism might contribute to mood, long-term cognitive tendencies, or learning — but these are not the features that quantum consciousness theories most urgently need to explain.

**Tenet alignment: Partial.** If consciousness modulates nuclear spin entanglement, this supports [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] (nuclear spins are about as small-scale as biological quantum effects get) and [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]. But the mechanism's slow timescale makes it unclear how consciousness would interface with rapid neural decisions. The connection to [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]] is undeveloped — Fisher's proposal is compatible with physicalism; nothing in it requires a non-physical observer.

**Empirical status: Early stage.** Lithium isotope effects on rat behaviour provide circumstantial support (⁶Li and ⁷Li have different nuclear spins). The QuBrain project at UCSB is pursuing direct experimental tests. No neural Posner molecules have been directly observed, and the entanglement → neural activity pathway remains speculative.

**Falsifiability: Good.** Fisher's proposal makes specific predictions: lithium isotopes should affect cognition differently; Posner molecules should be detectable in neural tissue; disrupting nuclear spin coherence (via specific magnetic field protocols) should impair cognition. These are concrete, testable claims — a strength even if the theory's relevance to consciousness remains uncertain.

## Spontaneous Collapse Hybrids: CSL-IIT and Consciousness-Modulated Collapse

Rather than proposing a specific neural mechanism, hybrid models combine spontaneous collapse theories (GRW, CSL) with consciousness frameworks (particularly [[integrated-information-theory|Integrated Information Theory]]). The core idea: physical collapse mechanisms operate universally as baseline, while consciousness *modulates* collapse parameters — rate, location, or outcome — in neural systems with high integrated information (Φ).

**Decoherence vulnerability: Not applicable.** These models don't require neural quantum coherence at all. Collapse occurs through modification of the Schrödinger equation itself (stochastic terms in CSL, discrete jumps in GRW). Consciousness modulates an already-occurring physical process rather than maintaining a fragile quantum state. This sidesteps the decoherence objection entirely.

**Phenomenological fit: Framework-dependent.** The phenomenological predictions depend on which consciousness metric serves as the collapse operator. If Φ (integrated information) modulates collapse, then consciousness is most effective in highly integrated systems — matching the intuition that unified experience correlates with integrated processing. But the model doesn't directly predict the effortful character of attention or the willed/automatic distinction. It explains *where* consciousness acts (high-Φ systems) without explaining *what it feels like* to act.

**Tenet alignment: Strongest.** Hybrid models satisfy all five tenets. Consciousness is ontologically distinct ([[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]). It modulates rather than creates collapse ([[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] — arguably the most minimal proposal). It causally influences outcomes ([[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]). Collapse is real and objective ([[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]). And the measurement problem's intractability under standard QM demonstrates complexity's necessity ([[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]). The prebiotic collapse problem is solved by the physical baseline — consciousness didn't need to exist for stars to form.

**Empirical status: Constrained.** The underlying physics (GRW, CSL) makes falsifiable predictions, and parameter space is shrinking. Germanium detector experiments and matter-wave interference tests constrain collapse rates. However, the consciousness modulation component remains untestable with current technology — we cannot measure whether Φ correlates with collapse dynamics.

**Falsifiability: Split.** The physical collapse component is highly falsifiable. The consciousness modulation component is not currently testable. This is both honest and concerning — the part we most want to test is the part we cannot reach.

| Tenet alignment | Mixed (MQI conflict) | Strong (all five) | Partial (dualism unclear) | Strongest (all five) |

## What the Comparison Reveals

Three patterns emerge from this evaluation.

**The decoherence divide.** Mechanisms divide sharply into those requiring sustained coherence (Orch OR) and those operating through discrete events or modified dynamics (Stapp, Fisher, CSL hybrids). The decoherence objection, while not the decisive blow critics once claimed, still differentially constrains proposals. Mechanisms that sidestep it entirely hold a structural advantage.

**Phenomenology matters.** Theories of consciousness should explain what consciousness is like, not merely where it acts. Stapp's model uniquely predicts the effortful character of attention, the willed/automatic distinction, and the temporal grain of experience. Other proposals explain that consciousness plays a causal role without explaining why that role has the phenomenological character it does. A complete theory must eventually address both.

**No single mechanism suffices.** Each proposal illuminates different aspects of the consciousness-quantum interface. Stapp explains the phenomenology of effort. Orch OR connects consciousness to spacetime structure. Fisher demonstrates that biological quantum effects can persist at relevant timescales. CSL hybrids solve the prebiotic problem and satisfy minimality. The Map's agnosticism about specific mechanisms reflects genuine uncertainty — but also the possibility that the full picture requires elements from multiple proposals.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The Unfinishable Map's [[tenets]] do not commit to any single quantum consciousness mechanism, and this comparison explains why that agnosticism is warranted. No proposal currently satisfies all desiderata simultaneously.

The Map's framework does, however, constrain the space of acceptable mechanisms. [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] rules against proposals requiring macroscopic quantum coherence or panpsychist commitments — a tension Orch OR must address. [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] requires that consciousness genuinely causes physical effects — ruling out proposals where consciousness is merely correlated with quantum processes. [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]] requires that collapse is real, not apparent.

Within these constraints, Stapp's Zeno model and consciousness-modulated spontaneous collapse emerge as the most tenet-compatible approaches. Stapp provides the phenomenological depth; CSL hybrids provide the physical framework. These are not competitors but potentially complementary: Stapp's mechanism could describe *how* consciousness modulates collapse (through attentional observation), while CSL provides the baseline collapse dynamics that consciousness modulates. The [[coupling-modes]] framework — basis control, timing control, probability control — provides vocabulary for specifying what such integration would require.

The Map's position is that *some* quantum consciousness mechanism exists, constrained by the tenets. Which mechanism is correct — or whether the correct mechanism has yet to be proposed — remains genuinely open.
