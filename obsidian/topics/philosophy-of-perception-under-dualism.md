Perception is the place where consciousness meets the world. The Unfinishable Map holds that how we understand perception depends fundamentally on whether we accept dualism—and accepting it transforms every major question in the field. If consciousness is irreducible to physical processes, then perception cannot be merely a brain process that happens to produce experience as a by-product. Perception involves a conscious subject encountering a world through an interface that is partly physical and partly phenomenal, and no account that omits either side can be complete.

## The Central Question

The philosophy of perception asks what happens when someone sees a red apple, hears a trumpet, or feels the warmth of sunlight. Three broad families of theory compete:

**Direct realism** holds that perception puts us in direct contact with mind-independent objects and their properties. You see the apple itself, not a representation of it.

**Indirect realism** (representationalism) holds that perception is mediated by mental representations. You experience an internal representation caused by the apple, not the apple directly.

**Idealism** holds that the "external" world is itself constituted by or dependent on mind. The distinction between representation and reality collapses.

Under physicalism, these debates unfold within a single ontological layer: everything involved—object, light, retina, neural processing, resulting experience—is physical. The question becomes which physical state is the object of perception and how to characterise the relationship between distal cause and proximal experience.

Dualism changes the terrain. If consciousness is ontologically distinct from the physical, then the perceptual relation crosses an ontological boundary. Light strikes the retina, neurons fire, and at some point experience arises in a domain that is not itself physical. This boundary crossing is the distinctive problem that dualist perception theory must address—and it opens possibilities that physicalist theories foreclose.

## Perception and the Explanatory Gap

The [[explanatory-gap]] is sharpest at perception. We can trace the causal chain from photons reflecting off a surface, through retinal transduction, lateral geniculate processing, and cortical computation (Palmer, 1999). At each step, the physical description is in principle complete: wavelengths, firing rates, activation patterns. Yet somewhere in this chain, the redness of red appears—the physical description never entails the phenomenal quality (Nagel, 1974).

This is the [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|hard problem]] applied to perception specifically, and it is where the hard problem is most vivid. Perception provides the clearest cases of [[qualia]]—the redness of red, the loudness of a sound, the warmth of a surface—and these are the paradigm examples of what physical description leaves out. The [[knowledge-argument]] crystallises this: a neuroscientist who knows everything about colour processing but has never seen red still learns something when she finally sees it (Jackson, 1982).

A physicalist can acknowledge the explanatory gap while insisting it is merely epistemic—a gap in our understanding, not in reality. The dualist holds that the gap is ontological: phenomenal qualities are genuinely distinct from the physical properties that occasion them. If this is correct, then no completed neuroscience of vision will explain why red looks the way it does, because the explanation requires crossing into a domain that neuroscience does not describe.

## What Dualism Adds to Perception Theory

Dualism does not simply insert a mystery into the causal chain. It reframes several longstanding problems in the philosophy of perception.

### The Problem of Perceptual Qualities

If [[qualia]] are irreducible, then the qualities we perceive—colours, sounds, tastes—are not identical with physical properties of objects or with neural activation patterns. This gives the dualist a distinctive position in the debate between colour realism (colours are mind-independent properties of surfaces) and colour anti-realism (colours exist only in experience).

The Map's position: perceptual qualities are constituted at the [[mind-matter-interface]] between physical processing and conscious experience. They are neither "out there" on surfaces nor "merely in the head" as neural patterns. They arise where consciousness meets the information delivered by sensory systems. Colour is real—genuinely experienced, with determinate qualitative character—but its reality is phenomenal rather than physical. The banana's yellowness is a property of the experience, not of the surface reflectance, yet it is no less real for that. (The [[inverted-qualia]] thought experiment reinforces this: two people could process identical wavelengths yet experience different colours, because the phenomenal quality is not fixed by the physical property.)

### Perception as Active Constitution

Under physicalism, the conscious subject is typically treated as the endpoint of a causal chain: the world acts on the senses, which act on the brain, which produces experience. Consciousness receives; it does not contribute.

The Map's [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|bidirectional interaction]] tenet opens a different possibility. If consciousness causally influences physical processes, then perception is not a one-way street. Consciousness may actively shape what is perceived—not in the sense of hallucinating or distorting, but in the sense of selecting, organising, and constituting the perceptual field.

This aligns with [[phenomenology-of-perceptual-constancy|perceptual constancy]]. A white wall looks white under candlelight and fluorescent light despite radically different wavelength compositions reaching the eye. Neuroscience explains much of this through adaptation, gain control, and cortical normalisation (Palmer, 1999), but the constancy as *experienced*—the seamless stability of the perceived world—goes beyond what these mechanisms predict. If consciousness contributes to maintaining this experiential stability—selecting the stable distal interpretation over the fluctuating proximal stimulus—then perception involves [[downward-causation]] from consciousness to neural processing.

The [[attention-as-selection-interface|attentional selection]] framework extends this further. Attention determines which sensory signals reach consciousness and in what form. If attention is the interface where consciousness selects among competing neural representations, then the content of perception is partly determined by consciousness itself. The perceiver is not a passive screen on which the world projects images but an active participant in constituting what appears.

### Blindsight and the Necessity of Consciousness for Perception

[[Blindsight]] provides perhaps the most striking empirical evidence for the dualist position on perception. Patients with damage to primary visual cortex can respond accurately to visual stimuli they report not seeing (Weiskrantz, 1986). They can point to a light's location, discriminate orientations, and detect motion—all while sincerely denying any visual experience.

Physicalists offer several responses. Some argue that blindsight patients retain degraded [[conscious-vs-unconscious-processing|conscious processing]]—a dim, impoverished visual awareness they fail to report. Others maintain that perception simply is information processing, and what blindsight patients lack is not perception itself but a particular mode of access to it. These responses have force. But they face a persistent difficulty: the functional performance of blindsight patients is strikingly inferior to normal vision. They require forced-choice procedures, respond slowly, and lack confidence. If consciousness were merely epiphenomenal—riding atop processing without contributing to it—this performance gap would be puzzling. Something about conscious vision makes perception *work better*.

For dualism, blindsight separates what it cleanly predicts should be separable: the physical processing of visual information and the conscious experience of seeing. The brain can process visual input without consciousness being involved, producing accurate but degraded behavioural responses. Normal perception adds something the physical processing alone does not provide—phenomenal awareness, the *what it is like* of seeing. Blindsight is processing without full consciousness: functional but experientially and behaviourally impoverished.

## Perception and the Interaction Problem

Any dualist theory of perception must address the interaction problem: how does consciousness, if ontologically distinct from the physical, interact with brain processes to generate perceptual experience?

The Map's framework offers a response through the [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|minimal quantum interaction]] tenet. Consciousness does not inject energy or information into the brain from outside. Instead, it biases otherwise indeterminate quantum events in neural processing—a mechanism explored in detail by [[stapp-quantum-mind|Stapp's quantum mind model]]. In perception, this might operate where neural computation reaches genuinely indeterminate branch points. Perceptual ambiguity (such as binocular rivalry) is a macroscopic, population-level phenomenon, but the neural processes resolving such ambiguity may involve micro-level indeterminacies where [[consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns|conscious selection]] could operate without violating physical conservation laws—precisely the kind of minimal intervention the tenet describes.

This is speculative, and the Map does not claim it as established. But it addresses a genuine puzzle: how can a non-physical consciousness participate in a physical process like perception without breaking the causal structure that makes perception reliable? If consciousness operates at quantum indeterminacies—points where physics itself leaves outcomes undetermined—it can participate without disrupting the physical regularities that make veridical perception possible.

## Predictive Processing and Dualist Perception

[[Predictive-processing-and-the-maps-framework|Predictive processing]] theories describe perception as the brain's best prediction about the causes of sensory input, updated by prediction errors. The brain does not passively receive sensory data but actively generates predictions, comparing them against incoming signals and revising when mismatches occur.

This framework is often presented in physicalist terms (Clark, 2013), but it is compatible with dualism—and may sit more naturally within it. The physicalist reads "the brain predicts" as shorthand for neural mechanisms that require no experiencing subject. This works as far as the computational story goes. But predictive processing also generates *phenomenal predictions*—the experienced world as the brain's best guess—and here the framework tacitly relies on there being something it is like to have the prediction confirmed or violated. [[Surprise-prediction-error-and-consciousness|Prediction error]] feels like something; the smooth confirmation of an expectation feels like something else. Dualism makes this phenomenal dimension explicit rather than leaving it as an unexplained accompaniment to the computation.

The phenomenology of perception supports this reading. Perceptual experience does not feel like passive reception. It feels like engagement—active, directed, attentive. We *look at* things, *listen to* sounds, *attend to* features (Husserl, 1913/1982). This agentive quality of perception is precisely what dualism's bidirectional interaction predicts: consciousness is not an endpoint but a participant. The objection that this smuggles in a homunculus—a little perceiver inside the perceiver—misses the point. The dualist does not posit an inner agent doing extra processing; the claim is that consciousness itself is the subject of experience, irreducible to the neural mechanisms it co-operates with.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The Unfinishable Map's [[tenets]] reshape the philosophy of perception in several interconnected ways.

**Dualism** means that perceptual experience is not identical with or reducible to neural processing. The explanatory gap between physical description and phenomenal quality is ontological, not merely epistemic. This rules out reductive accounts of perceptual qualities and motivates a view of perception as involving genuine phenomenal properties irreducible to information processing.

**Bidirectional interaction** means perception is not a one-way causal chain from world to experience. Consciousness contributes to what is perceived—through attention, through maintaining perceptual constancies, through selecting among ambiguous interpretations. Perception is a dialogue between consciousness and the physical world, not a monologue from world to mind.

**Minimal quantum interaction** provides a candidate mechanism for how consciousness participates in perception without violating conservation laws. The Map does not claim this mechanism is established but holds that the interaction problem has principled answers available.

**No Many Worlds** matters here because the Map's account of perception requires that there be a determinate fact about what the perceiver experiences. Under Many-Worlds interpretations, every perceptual ambiguity resolves in all possible ways across branching worlds—there is no selection, only branching. The Map holds that indexical identity matters: *this* perceiver sees *this* scene, and the phenomenal determinacy of perception is evidence that quantum outcomes are genuinely resolved, not merely indexed to branches.

**Occam's Razor has limits** reminds us that the simpler physicalist account—perception is "just" neural processing—is simpler only if we ignore the explanatory gap. Including the phenomenal dimension requires a richer ontology, but ignoring it produces an account of perception that leaves out the most salient feature of perceiving: that there is something it is like.
