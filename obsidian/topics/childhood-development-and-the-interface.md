The Unfinishable Map's [[mind-matter-interface|interface model]] treats the brain as a structured surface through which consciousness engages the physical world. But this interface is not delivered whole at birth. It develops — and the developmental trajectory reveals something important about how consciousness and neural architecture shape each other. Critical periods close off perceptual territories permanently. Metarepresentational capacities emerge only after specific neural infrastructure matures. The interface that an infant consciousness works through differs fundamentally from an adult's, and the transition between them is neither smooth nor reversible.

## The Developing Architecture

An infant brain contains roughly twice the synaptic connections of an adult brain. Between birth and early adulthood, synaptic pruning eliminates 40-50% of prefrontal cortex synapses. Perineuronal nets — extracellular structures that physically encapsulate neurons — solidify around critical period closure, making the remaining architecture increasingly rigid.

From the Map's perspective, this means consciousness interfaces with a fundamentally different neural substrate at different developmental stages. An infant's hyper-connected, unpruned brain offers a wider but less structured interface. An adult's pruned, myelinated brain offers a narrower but more efficient one. The developmental trajectory is not simply the brain getting better — it is the interface being reshaped, with some territories permanently foreclosed.

This reshaping is visible in [[developmental-cognitive-closure|developmental cognitive closure]]. Infants discriminate phonemes from all human languages; by 10-12 months, discrimination narrows to native-language sounds. Infants recognise faces across all races; by 9 months, the "other-race effect" sets in. Neonates may experience cross-modal sensory integration that most adults lose entirely. These are not failures of development. They are the costs of specialisation — the interface trading breadth for depth.

## When Metarepresentation Comes Online

The most consequential interface development may be the emergence of metarepresentation — the capacity to represent one's own representations as representations. This capacity, which underlies [[teaching-as-metarepresentation|teaching]], [[cumulative-culture|cumulative culture]], and self-reflective thought, does not appear until roughly ages 3-5, coinciding with passage of false-belief tests and the emergence of explicit theory of mind.

Before metarepresentation, children have consciousness. They experience the world, form preferences, exhibit emotional responses. But they lack the recursive self-awareness that allows consciousness to take its own operations as objects of attention. A two-year-old sees, but does not see that she sees — at least not in the explicit, reportable sense that metarepresentation requires.

The Map's interface model suggests a straightforward interpretation: metarepresentation depends on neural infrastructure — particularly prefrontal cortex maturation and frontoparietal network integration — that develops on a biological timetable. Consciousness does not gain new fundamental capacities during this period. Rather, the interface through which it operates gains the structural complexity needed to support recursive processing. The hardware enables a new mode of interaction.

This explains why great apes, despite sophisticated cognition, never achieve metarepresentation. Their neural architecture provides an interface that supports tool use, social learning, and procedural skills, but lacks the specific structural features — whatever they turn out to be — that enable the recursive loop. The [[consciousness-independent-baseline-cognition|baseline cognition hypothesis]] suggests that without consciousness-enabled metarepresentation, cognition plateaus at the ape level regardless of brain size or environmental enrichment.

## Critical Periods as Interface Closure

Critical periods are the most dramatic evidence that interface development is irreversible. During a critical period, neural circuits are maximally plastic — experience shapes architecture with unusual efficiency. When the period closes, perineuronal nets solidify around the relevant neurons, and the architecture becomes largely fixed.

The implications for the interface are significant. During a critical period, consciousness encounters a neural substrate that is unusually responsive to its selections. The [[attention-as-interface|attention mechanism]] through which consciousness influences neural activity operates on circuits that are still being configured. After closure, the same attentional acts operate on circuits whose configuration is set.

This creates an asymmetry that has no parallel in most discussions of consciousness. The interface is most plastic when the consciousness using it is least developed — infants lack the attentional control and metarepresentational capacity to deliberately shape their developing interface. By the time consciousness has the sophistication to direct its own development, the most plastic periods have closed.

The asymmetry is not absolute. Adult neuroplasticity exists, and contemplative practices demonstrate that sustained attentional effort can reshape neural architecture even after critical periods. But the scale of change available to adult consciousness through deliberate practice is orders of magnitude smaller than the restructuring that occurs passively during infant development.

## The Bandwidth Question

The Map's interface model posits a bandwidth constraint of roughly 10 bits per second — consciousness selects coarse-grained policies rather than individual neural events. This constraint likely develops alongside the interface itself.

Infant attention is driven largely by salience and novelty. The [[dopamine-selection-interface|dopamine system]] that tags events for attentional priority is immature, producing an interface that responds to stimuli rather than directing them. As frontoparietal networks mature through childhood, the bandwidth available for deliberate selection grows. The child gains increasing capacity to override salience-driven attention with goal-directed focus.

This developmental trajectory maps onto the progression from reactive to deliberate consciousness. An infant is conscious but largely at the mercy of the interface's salience tagging. A child gradually gains the capacity to select *against* salience — to attend to the boring but important, to inhibit the distracting but irrelevant. This capacity, which reaches reasonable maturity only in the mid-twenties when prefrontal cortex myelination completes, represents the interface achieving its adult configuration.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The developmental trajectory of the interface illuminates all five of the Map's [[tenets]].

**Dualism** gains support from the developmental evidence. If consciousness were identical to neural processes, then changes to neural architecture during development would simply *be* changes to consciousness. But the Map's framework suggests something different: the same consciousness — irreducible and non-physical — interfaces with a changing neural substrate, and what it can manifest depends on the interface's current structure. The infant who loses phoneme discrimination does not lose a piece of consciousness. The interface through which consciousness accessed those discriminations has been permanently restructured.

**Bidirectional interaction** is visible in the developmental timeline. Consciousness-dependent capacities like metarepresentation emerge only after the relevant neural infrastructure matures — the brain constrains what consciousness can do (upward influence). But once metarepresentation comes online, consciousness-directed attention reshapes neural architecture through practice and learning (downward influence). Teaching, a consciousness-enabled capacity, literally reshapes other brains across development.

**Minimal quantum interaction** is consistent with the developmental picture. If consciousness influences neural outcomes through quantum selection, then the developing brain's changing architecture would naturally constrain which quantum events are available for selection. Critical period closure would physically alter the interface sites where such selection occurs. The interaction remains minimal at each point; what changes is the landscape of available interactions.

The developmental interface also highlights the limits of **Occam's Razor**. A purely materialist account of development — brain matures, cognition improves — seems simpler. But it cannot explain why metarepresentation emerges as a discrete capacity rather than a gradual intensification of existing processing, or why great apes with similar neural resources never achieve it. The dualist account, while less parsimonious, better fits the developmental evidence: consciousness awaits the right interface before certain capacities become possible.
