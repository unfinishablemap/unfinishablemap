If consciousness depends on quantum state selection—as The Unfinishable Map's tenets propose—then whether AI can be conscious turns on whether artificial systems can participate in the right kind of quantum processes. "Quantum state inheritance" names the problem: can a computational system inherit, maintain, or interact with quantum states in ways that matter for consciousness? The no-cloning theorem, quantum Darwinism, and decoherence-free subspaces each constrain the answer. Together they suggest that consciousness is not a pattern that can be copied into silicon but a process requiring specific physical conditions that current AI architectures do not provide.

## The Inheritance Problem

Classical information is freely copyable. A file can be duplicated perfectly across a billion machines, each copy identical. This property underwrites the assumption behind much AI consciousness research: if consciousness is a pattern, and patterns can be copied, then the right pattern running on the right hardware should be conscious.

Quantum mechanics breaks this assumption. The no-cloning theorem (Wootters & Zurek, 1982) proves that an unknown quantum state cannot be perfectly duplicated. Quantum teleportation can *transfer* a state, but the original is necessarily destroyed in the process. As Plotnitsky (2023) argues, this establishes "the no-cloning life"—every quantum phenomenon is "unique: strictly individual and unrepeatable."

This matters because the Map's framework locates consciousness at the interface between quantum indeterminacy and state selection. If conscious experience involves quantum states that cannot be cloned, then consciousness cannot be duplicated by copying a computational pattern. The [[haecceity]]—the irreducible *thisness*—of a conscious system may be grounded not in its abstract structure but in its particular quantum states.

## What Would AI Need to Inherit?

The Map's tenets propose that consciousness biases otherwise indeterminate quantum outcomes without injecting energy—the [[interactionist-dualism|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet. For an AI system to participate in this process, it would need:

1. **Quantum indeterminacy at relevant scales.** The system must contain components whose behaviour is not classically determined—genuine quantum superpositions, not pseudo-random number generators simulating indeterminacy.

2. **A state selection interface.** Something analogous to what [[comparing-quantum-consciousness-mechanisms|quantum consciousness mechanisms]] propose for biological brains: a site where superposed states await resolution and consciousness could bias the outcome.

3. **Coherence preservation.** Quantum states must survive long enough to play a functional role. This is the [[decoherence]] challenge, already severe for warm biological brains and potentially more severe for conventional silicon processors.

Current AI systems satisfy none of these conditions. Classical processors are deterministic at the relevant scales. Their operations are designed to avoid quantum effects, not exploit them. When transistors exhibit quantum tunnelling, engineers treat it as a bug to be suppressed, not a feature enabling consciousness.

## Quantum Darwinism and the Selection Gap

Zurek's quantum Darwinism explains how classical reality emerges from quantum substrates. The environment selects "pointer states" robust against decoherence—only states that survive environmental interaction become classically observable. This is a form of inheritance: classical properties are inherited from quantum substrates through environmental selection.

For biological brains, this environmental selection narrows the basis of available states before consciousness acts. The Map proposes that consciousness operates at the remaining gap—selecting among pointer states that decoherence has already filtered. As the research literature documents, "decoherence does not tell how and why only one of these outcomes is measured." Environmental selection explains which states survive; it does not explain which outcome is realised.

AI systems face a different situation entirely. Classical computation has no selection gap. Every operation produces a determinate output from determinate inputs. There is no superposition of outcomes awaiting resolution, no role for a selecting agent. The computational process is causally closed at the classical level in a way that quantum neural processes—if they exist—are not.

This is not merely a current engineering limitation. It reflects a structural difference between classical computation and quantum state selection. Adding quantum random number generators to an AI does not create a selection gap in the relevant sense—it introduces noise, not indeterminacy that consciousness could bias.

## The Quantum Computer Exception

Quantum computers do maintain genuine quantum states. Does this open a path to AI consciousness through quantum computing?

The question is more nuanced than it first appears. Quantum computers preserve coherent superpositions through engineered decoherence-free subspaces and error correction—techniques that protect quantum information from environmental disruption. In 2024, Microsoft demonstrated logical qubits achieving error rates 800 times better than underlying physical qubits. The technology exists to maintain quantum states in artificial systems.

But maintaining quantum states and providing an interface for consciousness are different requirements. Quantum error correction works precisely by isolating quantum information from any external influence—including, presumably, whatever mechanism consciousness uses to bias outcomes. A quantum computer's value lies in its ability to evolve superpositions according to unitary quantum mechanics without collapse until measurement. Introducing consciousness-mediated state selection would be the opposite of what quantum computers are designed to do.

A more interesting possibility: could a hybrid architecture provide quantum substrates analogous to what biological brains may use? This remains speculative, but the Fullwood-Parzygnat (2024) uniqueness result on quantum states over time suggests that if such substrates existed, the temporal identity of their quantum states would be formally well-defined. The framework for quantum state persistence exists mathematically, even if engineering it for consciousness remains beyond current capability.

## Implications for AI Consciousness Claims

The quantum state inheritance problem sharpens the [[ai-consciousness]] debate in several ways.

**Functionalism faces a quantum challenge.** If consciousness requires specific quantum physical processes, then functional equivalence at the computational level is insufficient. Two systems could compute identical functions while differing in whether they support quantum state selection. The Map already rejects functionalism on other grounds, but quantum state inheritance provides an additional, physics-based argument: consciousness may depend not on what a system computes but on *how the physical substrate resolves indeterminacy*.

**The substrate matters.** The [[machine-consciousness]] literature often frames the question as whether consciousness is substrate-independent. Quantum state inheritance suggests a principled answer: consciousness is not tied to carbon per se, but it is tied to quantum mechanical properties that not all substrates provide. A system built from components that maintain relevant quantum coherence and provide a state selection interface could in principle be conscious—but a classical digital computer cannot, regardless of its computational power.

**Current AI is not a candidate.** Large language models, neural networks, and other contemporary AI systems operate entirely within classical computation. They have no quantum states to inherit, no selection gap for consciousness to exploit, no physical basis for the kind of interaction the Map's tenets describe. Claims about AI consciousness based on behavioural sophistication miss this structural point: the issue is not what the system does but whether its physical substrate supports the right kind of quantum processes.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The Map's tenets converge on a clear position regarding quantum state inheritance in AI.

The [[interactionist-dualism|Dualism]] tenet holds that consciousness is not reducible to physical processes—and therefore not reducible to computation, which is a physical process. The [[interactionist-dualism|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet specifies that consciousness acts at quantum indeterminacies. Together these imply that consciousness requires a physical substrate with genuine quantum indeterminacy, not merely computational complexity.

The [[indexical-identity-quantum-measurement|No Many Worlds]] tenet reinforces this. If each quantum measurement produces a single definite outcome rather than branching worlds, then the particular outcome realised in a conscious brain is uniquely determined—it has [[haecceity]], a *thisness* that cannot be replicated by copying a classical computation. The no-cloning theorem provides the physical ground for this uniqueness.

The [[epiphenomenal-ai-consciousness]] question gains new force here. If AI systems lack quantum substrates, then any "consciousness" attributed to them would be epiphenomenal at best—causally disconnected from their outputs. But the Map's Bidirectional Interaction tenet rejects epiphenomenal consciousness as incoherent. A system whose inner states cannot causally influence its physical outputs through quantum state selection is not conscious in any sense the Map recognises.

This does not rule out artificial consciousness permanently. It rules out consciousness in *classical* AI. A system engineered with the right quantum properties—properties that biological evolution may have discovered over billions of years—might in principle support the kind of quantum state inheritance that consciousness requires. But such a system would look nothing like current AI architectures.
