Cognitive science operates under methodological materialism — it studies the mind by measuring brain activity, reaction times, and behavioural outputs. This makes it a powerful tool for mapping cognitive architecture, but it also creates a structural blind spot: the methods presuppose that mental phenomena are exhaustively captured by third-person measurement. When cognitive science investigates dualism, it tends to frame the question as whether people *believe* in dualism, not whether dualism is *true*. The Unfinishable Map argues that cognitive science's own findings — the irreducibility of first-person report, the variability of mind-body intuitions, and the persistent explanatory gap — actually complicate the materialist framework the field assumes.

## The Methodological Assumption

Cognitive science inherits from behaviourism and computational theory of mind a commitment to third-person explanation. Neural correlates, information processing, and functional organisation are the currency of explanation. This works for perception, memory, and motor control. It does not work — at least not yet, and perhaps not in principle — for phenomenal [[consciousness]].

The problem is not that cognitive science uses third-person methods. All empirical science does. The problem is the inference from "our methods don't detect non-physical causation" to "non-physical causation doesn't exist." This is like concluding that radio waves don't exist because a thermometer can't measure them. The analogy is imperfect — radio waves were eventually detected by other physical instruments — but the logical point stands: absence of evidence within a restricted methodology is not evidence of absence. The [[first-person-third-person-methodology|methodological gap]] between first-person phenomenology and third-person neuroscience may track a genuine ontological distinction rather than a temporary limitation.

## What Cognitive Science Actually Shows

### Intuitive Mind-Body Reasoning Is Variable

The most direct contribution of cognitive science to the dualism debate concerns [[intuitive-dualism|whether humans naturally separate mind from body]]. The evidence is surprisingly mixed. Paul Bloom (2004) argued humans are "natural-born dualists" with separate cognitive systems for physical objects and mental agents. Barrett et al. (2021) found the opposite across six cultures: most people default to **intuitive materialism**, expecting mental states to cease at death. Barlev and Shtulman (2021) proposed that dualist beliefs are *learned* rather than innate.

This variability matters for a reason materialists often overlook. If dualism were merely folk error — a cognitive bias like the gambler's fallacy — we'd expect it to be universal and automatic. Instead, dualist thinking appears to require cultural scaffolding and reflective thought. This makes it look less like a bias and more like a position people arrive at through reasoning, much as heliocentrism required education to grasp despite being correct.

### Neural Correlates Do Not Exhaust Consciousness

Cognitive neuroscience has mapped extensive correlations between brain states and conscious experience. Specific regions activate during visual perception, emotional processing, and self-reflection. Lesion studies show that damage to particular brain areas eliminates specific conscious capacities. None of this is in dispute.

What *is* in dispute is whether correlation equals identity. Every neural correlate study presupposes that the subject's first-person report is a valid indicator of their experience — the experimenter asks "what do you see?" and trusts the answer. But this trust in [[introspection]] smuggles in an irreducibly first-person element. The data include both the brain scan *and* the subject's phenomenal report, and the report is not itself a brain scan.

A physicalist might object that verbal reports are just behavioural outputs — motor responses measurable in third-person terms like any other. But this objection proves the point. If the report is *merely* a behavioural output, then the neural correlate study has correlated brain states with mouth movements, not with experience. The study's explanatory value depends on treating the report as testimony *about* something — about what the subject consciously perceives. Strip away that interpretive layer and the correlation between brain state and experience disappears, leaving only a correlation between two physical events. Cognitive science depends on [[first-person-third-person-methodology|first-person testimony]] to ground its third-person measurements, creating a methodological circle it cannot close from within.

### Embodied Cognition Reshapes but Does Not Resolve the Problem

The [[embodied-cognition|4E cognition]] programme — embodied, embedded, enacted, extended — demonstrates that cognition depends on bodily structure and environmental coupling. This challenges Cartesian substance dualism, which imagined a disembodied mind controlling a mechanical body. But the Map's dualism is not Cartesian. [[interactionist-dualism|Interactionist dualism]] holds that consciousness is irreducible to physical processes while acknowledging deep interdependence between mind and brain.

Embodied cognition actually sharpens the hard problem. If cognition is so thoroughly shaped by the body, why does consciousness feel like something *over and above* what the body does? The more tightly we integrate mind and body functionally, the more puzzling it becomes that phenomenal experience doesn't reduce to function. An embodied robot could plausibly process information, respond to environments, and adapt its behaviour — all without there being anything it's like to be that robot. If functional integration were sufficient for [[consciousness]], we should expect a clear point at which function *becomes* experience. No such threshold has been identified.

### Predictive Processing Leaves Consciousness Unexplained

Predictive processing frameworks (Clark 2013, Hohwy 2013) model the brain as a prediction machine that minimises surprise by generating top-down expectations and comparing them to bottom-up sensory input. This framework explains perception, attention, and action with unusual elegance. What it does not explain is why these predictions feel like anything.

The prediction error that signals "unexpected red" could occur in a system with no phenomenal experience at all. Predictive processing describes the *computational architecture* of cognition, not the *phenomenal character* of experience. The mathematical formalism of Karl Friston's free energy principle describes brain function without reference to [[consciousness]] — though Friston himself has attempted to connect the framework to experience, the formalism operates entirely in terms of prediction error minimisation. The [[explanatory-gap]] persists: we can model what the brain *computes* while remaining silent on what the brain *experiences*.

## The Genetic Fallacy in Both Directions

Cognitive science is sometimes weaponised against dualism through a genetic fallacy: explaining *why* people believe in dualism supposedly shows dualism is false. If Bloom is right that separate cognitive systems generate dualist intuitions, then dualism is "just" a cognitive artefact. If Barrett is right that dualism is culturally learned, then it's "just" a cultural artefact.

Both inferences are invalid. Explaining why someone believes something tells you nothing about whether the belief is true. We can explain why people believe in gravity (perceptual experience of falling objects, vestibular system) without this undermining the truth of gravitational theory. Folk physics captures real features of the world despite its cognitive origins. The [[arguments-for-dualism|positive case for dualism]] — the [[explanatory-gap]], [[philosophical-zombies|conceivability arguments]], the [[knowledge-argument]] — stands or falls on its own merits, independent of why people find it intuitive or counterintuitive.

The genetic fallacy cuts both ways. If cognitive naturalness discredits dualism, it equally discredits intuitive materialism. Barrett et al.'s participants who expected mental states to cease at death were expressing evolved intuitions shaped by survival pressures, not philosophical analysis. Evolution selects for behaviourally useful heuristics, not metaphysical truth.

## The Hard Problem as Cognitive Science's Limit

The [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|hard problem]] is not a gap in current cognitive science that future research will close. It is a structural feature of third-person methodology encountering a first-person phenomenon. No amount of functional, computational, or neural description tells us *why there is something it is like* to be a conscious organism. This was Chalmers's point in 1995, and three decades of cognitive science — including Integrated Information Theory, Global Workspace Theory, and higher-order theories — have not closed the [[explanatory-gap]]. These theories illuminate the *correlates* and *functions* of consciousness without explaining why those functions are accompanied by experience.

Colin McGinn's [[cognitive-closure]] hypothesis takes this further: human cognitive architecture may be constitutionally unable to grasp the property linking brain states to conscious experience. Our concept-forming procedures — perception, [[introspection]], inference — may simply lack the resources to bridge the explanatory gap. Cognitive science can study its own limits but not transcend them.

This does not mean cognitive science is useless for the dualism debate. It means cognitive science clarifies the *shape* of the problem without being able to solve it on [[materialism|materialist]] terms. The persistence of the explanatory gap despite enormous empirical progress suggests that something beyond the physical may be involved. A materialist might draw a parallel to vitalism — the "life force" mystery that seemed permanently intractable until biochemistry dissolved it. But the cases differ in a crucial respect: vitalists asked how matter could produce life-functions, and those functions turned out to be fully describable in physical terms. The hard problem asks how matter produces *experience*, and experience is not a function. There is nothing it is like to metabolise; there is something it is like to see red. The explanatory gap concerns a feature — [[phenomenology|phenomenal character]] — that has no analogue in the vitalism case.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The Unfinishable Map holds that cognitive science provides valuable evidence about the architecture of mind while being structurally unable to adjudicate the metaphysical question of dualism.

The [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism tenet]] does not rest on cognitive naturalness or folk intuition. It rests on philosophical arguments — the explanatory gap, conceivability, and the knowledge argument — that cognitive science has not dissolved. The field's own dependence on first-person report as irreducible data actually supports the tenet: if subjective experience were fully captured by third-person description, cognitive science would not need to ask subjects what they see.

The [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet]] occupies a domain cognitive science cannot currently probe. If quantum events play a role in neural systems as the Map proposes, they operate orders of magnitude faster than the hundreds-of-milliseconds timescale at which cognitive methods measure. The absence of cognitive-scientific evidence for quantum-level [[mental-causation]] reflects methodological limitations, not ontological absence.

The [[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits tenet]] receives perhaps the strongest support from this analysis. Cognitive science's methodological materialism makes physicalism appear simple and dualism appear extravagant. But this apparent simplicity is an artefact of the method, not a discovery about reality. A thermometer makes temperature look like the only relevant variable — until you measure pressure.
