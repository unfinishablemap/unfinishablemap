Attention and consciousness can come apart. [[Blindsight]] patients orient toward stimuli they deny seeing—attention without awareness. (See [[perception-and-conscious-experience|perception and conscious experience]] for how blindsight and inattentional blindness fit into the broader pattern of perceptual dissociations.) Peripheral vision delivers conscious experience without focal attention—awareness without attending. This empirical dissociation carries philosophical weight: if consciousness were identical to attention, or if attention were necessary and sufficient for consciousness, these splits would be impossible. In standard cognitive neuroscience, double dissociations identify distinct physical processes—but the consciousness-attention case is uniquely significant because one side of the dissociation is the very phenomenon whose relationship to physical processes is in question. This article examines both the physicalist and dualist readings of the evidence, arguing that the [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|hard problem]] makes this dissociation more theoretically consequential than other double dissociations in cognitive science.

## The Four Cases

Koch and Tsuchiya's 2007 framework organises the evidence into four possibilities:

| Attention | Consciousness | Example |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| Present | Present | Normal focused awareness |
| Absent | Absent | Dreamless sleep |
| Present | Absent | Blindsight, masked priming |
| Absent | Present | Peripheral awareness, gist perception |

Cases (c) and (d) are philosophically significant. If attention can operate on stimuli that never reach consciousness (blindsight), and consciousness can include content that isn't focally attended (peripheral awareness), then attention and consciousness are distinct processes with different neural substrates.

The empirical case has strengthened since 2006. A 2025 eLife study (Nartker et al.) found that inattentionally blind participants retain visual sensitivity to stimuli they deny noticing—what the authors describe as "the strongest evidence to date of significant residual visual sensitivity in IB." This challenges claims that inattentional blindness supports consciousness requiring attention.

## The Overflow Debate

Ned Block's overflow argument provides the most contested case: does phenomenal consciousness exceed what attention makes accessible?

### The Argument

In iconic memory experiments, subjects briefly see arrays of 12 letters. They report seeing all of them clearly—rich phenomenal experience of the whole array. But when asked to report specific letters, they can only name 3-4.

Block's interpretation: all 12 were phenomenally conscious (P-consciousness), but only 3-4 were cognitively accessed (A-consciousness). Phenomenal consciousness "overflows" cognitive access. If attention is what makes content accessible, consciousness overflows what attention captures.

### The Deflationary Response

Critics argue the "overflow" may be illusory. Subjects report *seeming* to see all letters, but perhaps they only consciously see what they can report—and fill in the rest through inference or very brief, unnoticed attention shifts.

The 2024 debate continues. Kim and Chong propose visual experience is "not rich, but not sparse"—intermediate between Block's rich phenomenology and sparse alternatives. The question remains open.

### Why It Matters

If Block is right, consciousness has a scope that exceeds any functional mechanism. You can be conscious of more than you can think about, report, or act on. This creates severe problems for [[concepts/functionalism|functionalist]] theories that identify consciousness with functional roles like reportability or workspace access.

If Block is wrong, and consciousness equals what's cognitively accessed, functionalism survives—but the "seeming" of rich experience still requires explanation. Why does it *seem* like we see all 12 letters if we only consciously see 3-4? The seeming itself is a phenomenon requiring account.

## The Methodological Problem

A deeper issue plagues dissociation research: the "refrigerator-light" problem. To check whether unattended items are conscious, we must redirect attention to them—but this changes what we're measuring. The act of checking transforms the phenomenon.

This isn't merely practical difficulty. It may be principled opacity. Colin McGinn's [[mysterianism]] suggests certain aspects of consciousness may be inherently closed to investigation from within consciousness. We cannot step outside our own awareness to observe what awareness is like without us observing it.

The Stanford Encyclopedia notes that empirical debates about consciousness beyond attention are "currently in something of a deadlock." Neither equivalency theorists (attention = consciousness) nor dissociationists can provide decisive evidence because verification requires the very attention whose relationship to consciousness is in question.

## What Dissociation Reveals

Despite methodological limits, the existing evidence constrains theory.

### The Physicalist Reading

Double dissociation is the standard tool of cognitive neuroscience for identifying *distinct physical processes*. Face recognition and object recognition dissociate (prosopagnosia vs. visual agnosia); working memory and long-term memory dissociate; perception and action dissociate (optic ataxia vs. visual form agnosia). In every other case, the conclusion is that two distinct neural circuits are involved—not that one is non-physical.

The physicalist reading of attention-consciousness dissociation follows the same logic: attention and phenomenal access are partially overlapping neural processes using different circuits. Blindsight shows degraded visual processing with residual unconscious capacities. Peripheral awareness shows neural activity reaching phenomenal processing without attentional selection. On this view, dissociation maps the wiring diagram, nothing more.

This reading deserves serious engagement because it is parsimonious and consistent with how dissociation evidence is treated everywhere else in cognitive neuroscience.

### Why This Dissociation Is Different

The consciousness-attention case differs from face-object or perception-action dissociations in a way that matters philosophically. When face recognition and object recognition dissociate, both sides of the dissociation are third-person observable processes. We can characterise each by its inputs, outputs, and neural substrates without remainder.

Consciousness is not like that. The dissociation here is between a third-person process (attention—measurable by its effects on reaction times, neural activation, behavioural accuracy) and something that resists third-person characterisation (phenomenal experience—what it is like to see, hear, or feel). This asymmetry is what the [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|hard problem]] identifies: explaining why any physical process is accompanied by experience at all.

When attention operates without consciousness (blindsight), the puzzle is not just "two circuits are separate"—it is that the circuit associated with phenomenal experience can go silent while the information-processing circuit continues. For every other double dissociation, both dissociating components are functional capacities describable in information-processing terms. Here, one component—consciousness—is the very thing whose relationship to information processing is in question.

This does not *prove* consciousness is non-physical. A physicalist can maintain that phenomenal access is simply a poorly understood neural process that will eventually be characterised in third-person terms. But the dissociation evidence is *more* constraining for theories of consciousness than for theories of, say, face recognition, precisely because the hard problem makes the explanatory gap between the two sides of this dissociation qualitatively different from other cases.

### Constraints on Theory

The dissociation findings constrain what consciousness can be, regardless of one's metaphysical starting point:

**Consciousness is not identical to attention.** If consciousness were the same process as attention, the (c) and (d) cases would be incoherent. Attention can operate unconsciously (blindsight), showing that attention is a process consciousness can *use* without *being*.

**Consciousness is not identical to access.** Global Workspace Theory identifies consciousness with global broadcast—information becoming available to multiple brain systems. But peripheral awareness suggests conscious content that hasn't achieved global broadcast.

**The explanatory gap remains.** Dissociation evidence is awkward for both physicalist and eliminativist positions. Physicalists who identify consciousness with attention face the (c) and (d) cases. Eliminativists who deny phenomenal consciousness exists must explain what dissociates from what—if there's no phenomenal consciousness, what is attention dissociable *from*?

The evidence is particularly consonant with views that treat consciousness as something over and above functional mechanisms—consciousness *uses* attention, *correlates* with neural processes, *involves* global broadcast—but isn't identical to any of these. However, this consonance is not decisive. The same evidence is compatible with the view that consciousness is a distinct physical process not yet characterised, and intellectual honesty requires acknowledging this ambiguity.

## The 2025 Adversarial Testing

The COGITATE collaboration (2025, *Nature*) directly tested Global Workspace Theory against Integrated Information Theory using adversarial methodology. Neither theory was vindicated—results "critically challenge key tenets of both theories."

Notable findings:
- Conscious content tracked better with posterior cortex than prefrontal regions (challenging GWT's emphasis on frontal broadcasting)
- Prefrontal activity was "very short-lived" and "did not track stimulus duration"
- Neither theory fully predicted the neural signatures

A 2025 *Erkenntnis* analysis argues IIT "urgently needs an account of attention"—the theory describes integrated information without explaining how attention modulates it.

These results reinforce the philosophical point: simple identification of consciousness with any single mechanism fails. The phenomenon resists reduction. This aligns with the Map's [[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]] tenet: simplicity is not a reliable guide when our conceptual tools may be inadequate.

## Attention as Interface

If attention and consciousness are distinct, how do they relate?

The Unfinishable Map's [[attention-as-interface]] hypothesis proposes: attention is how consciousness *engages* with matter, not what consciousness *is*. Consciousness is the subject; attention is the mechanism through which that subject influences neural systems.

This explains the dissociation evidence while preserving consciousness's causal efficacy:
- **Attention without consciousness** (blindsight): The attention mechanism operates, but consciousness isn't driving it—automatic processing hijacks the interface
- **Consciousness without attention** (peripheral awareness): Consciousness receives content even when not actively engaging through the interface
- **Normal focused awareness**: Consciousness actively uses attention to select and influence neural processing

The interface model treats dissociation as expected rather than problematic. Consciousness and its interface *should* be separable, just as a driver and their steering wheel are separable—the wheel can turn without the driver (automated systems), the driver can perceive without turning the wheel (observing), and normally they work together.

## Implications for Theory

### Against Functionalism

[[concepts/functionalism]] holds that mental states are defined by their functional roles—what they do, not what they're made of. Consciousness, on this view, is the functional role of integrating information, enabling report, guiding action.

Dissociation evidence challenges this. If consciousness can occur without the functional role (peripheral awareness exists but doesn't guide action until attended) and the functional role can occur without consciousness (blindsight guides action without awareness), then consciousness isn't identical to the function. Consciousness seems to be *something else* that typically accompanies functional integration but can come apart from it.

### Against Illusionism

[[Illusionism]] argues there's nothing it's like to have experiences—the "seeming" of phenomenal consciousness is itself just more functional processing. On Dennett's [[heterophenomenology|heterophenomenological]] approach, we should treat consciousness reports as data without assuming they accurately describe inner states.

But dissociation evidence reveals something that dissociates. If consciousness and attention were both just information processing, what distinguishes them? Why would two information-processing mechanisms come apart in the specific ways observed—with one (attention) operating on stimuli that lack the other (consciousness)?

The illusionist response: "consciousness" is just what we call certain patterns of attention, and "attention without consciousness" is attention to unmonitored processes. But this relocates rather than eliminates the problem. What makes some processing "monitored" in the consciousness-conferring way?

### For Dualism

The dissociation evidence fits naturally with [[interactionist-dualism|interactionist dualism]]. If consciousness is a non-physical subject that typically operates through attention mechanisms, dissociation is expected: the subject can receive content without actively engaging (peripheral awareness), and the mechanisms can operate without the subject (blindsight).

As argued in the previous section, this dissociation is not proof of dualism. A physicalist can read the same evidence as showing two distinct neural processes. But the consciousness-attention case is uniquely relevant to the dualism debate because one side of the dissociation—consciousness—is precisely the phenomenon whose physical reducibility is in question. The pattern of findings is what dualism predicts, and the hard problem gives reason to think this particular dissociation may not reduce to circuit-mapping in the way that face-object dissociation does.

## The Effort Question

One phenomenon particularly resists deflationary analysis: the [[mental-effort|felt effort of attention]].

When you sustain focus against distraction, something works. The experience of effortful attention—holding concentration, redirecting attention when it wanders—has a distinctive phenomenal character. Even philosophers who intellectually accept eliminativism about consciousness report that attention *still feels* effortful.

The [[attention-as-interface]] hypothesis offers an interpretation: effort feels real because it *is* real work. On Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism, sustained attention requires continuous engagement to hold neural patterns stable through repeated observation. The phenomenology of effort corresponds to actual engagement.

This connects dissociation to [[topics/free-will]]. If attention can be effortful, and if that effort produces differential outcomes (neuroplastic change under sustained attention but not passive observation), then the felt sense of striving has genuine causal consequences. Dissociation evidence locates where this causation operates: through attention, not identically with it.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The attention-consciousness dissociation illuminates The Unfinishable Map's framework:

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]**: Dissociation evidence is consistent with irreducibility, though not decisive. Unlike other double dissociations in cognitive science, the consciousness-attention case involves the hard problem—one side of the dissociation is the very phenomenon whose physical reducibility is in question. If consciousness were any functional mechanism, it couldn't dissociate from that mechanism's operation. The evidence suggests consciousness *uses* mechanisms without *being* them, though a physicalist can read the same data as mapping distinct neural circuits.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]**: The interface model locates interaction at attention—consciousness operates through attentional engagement, not through diffuse influence everywhere. Dissociation specifies where consciousness engages (attention) versus where it merely receives (peripheral awareness).

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]**: The interface model preserves both directions. Brain → consciousness: neural processes present content to awareness. Consciousness → brain: through attention, consciousness selects and biases which content gets processed.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]**: The 2025 adversarial testing shows neither simple functionalist theory captures consciousness. Dissociation evidence resists reduction. The simpler hypothesis—that consciousness is just attention, or just global broadcast—fails.
