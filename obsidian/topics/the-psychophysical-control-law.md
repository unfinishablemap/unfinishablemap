The Unfinishable Map commits to [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|bidirectional interaction]]—consciousness causally influences the physical world through quantum selection. But commitment is not specification. A psychophysical control law would state *precisely* how phenomenal states map to physical selection outputs: which aspects of experience serve as inputs, which physical parameters change as a result, and what functional form connects them. Without such a law, "consciousness selects" remains a promissory note. This article examines what a psychophysical control law would need to look like, why specifying one is so difficult, and where candidate formulations stand.

## What a Control Law Must Specify

A control law in engineering states the relationship between sensed error (difference between desired and actual state) and the corrective output the controller produces. A thermostat's control law is trivial: if temperature < setpoint, heat on; else off. An aircraft autopilot's is complex: combining proportional, integral, and derivative responses across multiple axes simultaneously.

The [[control-theoretic-will|control-theoretic framing]] of consciousness identifies the will as a controller governing neural dynamics through a ~10 bits/second channel. To make this more than metaphor, three elements need specification:

**Input variables**: What the controller senses. In the Map's framework, phenomenal experience provides the sensor channel—qualia, felt states, the what-it-is-like of current neural activity. But which phenomenal dimensions feed into the control law? The intensity of attention, the felt quality of effort, the valence of experience, the structure of intention—these are candidates, but the control law must specify which ones function as error signals.

**Output variables**: What the controller modulates. The [[coupling-modes]] taxonomy identifies three candidates: basis control (selecting which quantum observable gets measured), timing control (determining when collapse occurs), and probability control (reweighting outcome likelihoods). Each implies a different control law.

**The mapping function**: How inputs determine outputs. Does doubling phenomenal effort double the physical effect? Is there a threshold below which consciousness has no influence? Are there saturation limits? Does the relationship vary across brain regions, developmental stages, or states of consciousness?

## The Specification Gap

The psychophysical control law remains unspecified—not just in the Map's framework but in every serious interactionist dualist proposal. This gap has both mundane and deep explanations.

### Scientific Immaturity

Physics took two millennia from Aristotle to Newton before arriving at F=ma. Consciousness science is young. The gap may simply reflect insufficient knowledge about the physical side of the interface. When neuroscience better characterizes the quantum-relevant processes in neural tissue—if such processes exist at measurable scale—the coupling parameters may become empirically accessible.

### Conceptual Asymmetry

We lack a measurement theory for phenomenal states comparable to what physics provides for physical quantities. Physical variables have defined units, standardised instruments, and intersubjective verification. Phenomenal variables—how much attention, how intense the effort—have none of these. A control law connecting unmeasured inputs to specifiable outputs cannot be fully formalised until both sides admit quantification.

This is not merely a practical problem. The [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|hard problem]] concerns precisely this asymmetry: phenomenal properties resist the third-person characterisation that science requires. A psychophysical control law must bridge first-person phenomenology and third-person physics—the same bridge that the hard problem claims cannot be built from the physical side alone.

### The T-Shirt Problem

Jonathan Schaffer's "t-shirt problem" names a deeper concern. Good fundamental laws fit on a t-shirt: F=ma, E=mc², S=k ln W. Psychophysical laws may resist this compression. The correlations between phenomenal states and physical states might be real but irreducibly complex—no elegant formula capturing them because the mapping reflects evolutionary contingency rather than fundamental simplicity.

Chalmers resists this conclusion: "It would be odd if the universe had fundamental laws connecting complex functional organizations to conscious experiences. Rather, one would expect it to be a consequence of simpler, more fundamental psychophysical laws." The Map shares this hope while acknowledging it remains unfulfilled.

## Candidate Formulations

Five candidate mechanisms exist for psychophysical coupling (detailed in [[psychophysical-laws]]). Here the question is not which mechanism operates but what control law *form* each implies.

### Stapp's Attention-Rate Law

Henry Stapp's proposal implies the most developed control law:

**Form**: The rate of quantum observations on a neural pattern is proportional to the intensity of conscious attention directed at that pattern.

In control-theoretic notation: *observation frequency = f(attention intensity)*, where f is monotonically increasing. The quantum Zeno effect then converts observation rate into pattern stability—higher observation frequency means lower probability of the pattern transitioning to an alternative.

This gives a recognisable control structure: a **proportional controller** where the control output (observation rate) scales with the input (attention intensity). The gain parameter—how much observation rate changes per unit of attention—would be the fundamental psychophysical constant in Stapp's framework.

**Strengths**: Specific enough to generate predictions. Effort phenomenology tracks what the law says should happen: harder tasks require more intense attention, which the law translates into higher observation rates needed to maintain stability against stronger competing patterns. OCD (Schwartz et al. 1996) provides a suggestive case: patients using mindful attention to redirect neural activity from compulsive circuits produced measurable metabolic changes in the caudate nucleus—though this is also compatible with purely physicalist neuroplasticity.

**Limitations**: The Zeno mechanism faces the [[decoherence]] timescale challenge. And the law's proportionality assumption is just that—an assumption. The true relationship might be nonlinear, threshold-dependent, or state-dependent. Without being able to independently measure both attention intensity and observation rate, the proportionality claim cannot be tested.

### Eccles' Intention-Probability Law

John Eccles' framework implies a different form:

**Form**: The probability of vesicle release at a synapse is shifted by the intensity of conscious intention directed at the corresponding action.

This is a **probability-reweighting controller**: consciousness does not determine outcomes but tilts probabilities. The control output is a bias term added to the quantum tunnelling probability that governs neurotransmitter release.

**Strengths**: Probability reweighting is minimal—consistent with the [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet. The form is testable in principle: measure vesicle release probabilities during intended versus unintended actions.

**Limitations**: The [[pairing-problem|pairing problem]] undermines the framework before the control law becomes relevant. And intention is a coarser phenomenal variable than attention—it is unclear how intention maps to specific synapses among millions.

### Policy-Selection Law

The Map's [[consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns#Policy-Level Selection|policy-level framework]] implies a discrete rather than continuous control law:

**Form**: Consciousness selects among a finite set of action policies that the brain has prepared. Selection is discrete (choose one), not continuous (modulate a parameter).

In control terms, this is a **switching controller**—the simplest possible control law, requiring only enough bandwidth to specify which option (typically from a small set). With the ~10 bits/second constraint, consciousness could select among up to 1024 options per second, though realistic decisions involve far fewer.

**Strengths**: Minimal bandwidth requirements. Consistent with Libet-style findings: the brain prepares options, consciousness selects or vetoes. Avoids the specification problem at the micro-level—the law governs policy choice, not neural-level quantum events.

**Limitations**: Pushes the hard question backward. *How* does selecting a policy translate into physical neural changes? If "consciousness selects policy A" means "consciousness biases quantum events in the neural ensemble representing A," the micro-level control law is still needed. Policy selection may describe the phenomenology of willing without specifying the underlying mechanism.

## Constraints Any Control Law Must Satisfy

Whatever the psychophysical control law turns out to be, the Map's commitments and empirical constraints jointly require:

**Bandwidth compatibility.** The law's information throughput must not exceed ~10 bits/second. This rules out laws where consciousness specifies neural activity at the level of individual neurons or synapses. Selection must be coarse-grained—at the level of action policies, attentional focus, or pattern stabilisation.

**Conservation compliance.** The law must not imply energy injection into the physical system. Probability reweighting, basis selection, and observation-rate modulation all satisfy this by operating within quantum indeterminacy rather than against physical law. A control law that required consciousness to *add* energy to neural systems would violate the [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet and face empirical refutation.

**Scope locality.** The law must explain why consciousness influences its own brain but not external systems. In control-theoretic terms, only the system within the controller's feedback loop is controllable. The control law operates through the [[attention-as-interface|attention interface]]—neural systems that provide phenomenal feedback and accept attentional selection—and not through systems lacking that loop.

**Phenomenological consistency.** The law must match what conscious effort feels like. If the law says doubling effort doubles physical effect, then harder tasks should feel twice as effortful as slightly hard ones. If the law implies a threshold, there should be a phenomenological correlate of crossing it. First-person experience provides an independent check on the law's form.

**Falsifiability.** The law must predict something that could, in principle, turn out to be false. Stapp's proportionality claim predicts that sustained high-effort attention should show specific neural signatures distinguishable from low-effort processing. If these signatures cannot be found—or if they fully reduce to conventional neuroplasticity—the law loses empirical traction.

## Why Specification Matters

The specification gap is not merely an academic problem. It determines whether the Map's position is a scientific research programme or a philosophical commitment that science cannot touch.

A psychophysical control law, even schematic, would:

**Generate novel predictions.** If attention intensity maps to observation rate, meditation should produce measurable quantum-relevant effects in neural tissue. If policy selection is discrete, reaction time distributions should show quantisation effects absent from continuous-dynamics models.

**Enable disconfirmation.** Without a law, any outcome can be reconciled with "consciousness selects." With a law, specific outcomes falsify specific predictions.

**Distinguish the Map from epiphenomenalism.** Both the Map and [[epiphenomenalism|epiphenomenalists]] agree consciousness exists. The difference lies in causal efficacy—and that difference is invisible without specifiable, testable coupling between phenomenal and physical variables.

## The Path Forward

Three developments could advance psychophysical control law specification:

**Bandwidth measurement.** Zheng and Meister's ~10 bits/second finding constrains the control channel's capacity. More precise measurements—varying by task type, attention mode, and cognitive load—would constrain the control law's form. If the bandwidth is strictly constant across conditions, a proportional law is unlikely; if it varies systematically, the variation pattern constrains the mapping function.

**Quantum biology in neural tissue.** Whether quantum effects survive at decision-relevant timescales in the brain remains contested. The 2024 microtubule-stabilising drug study (Cohen's d = 1.9 for delaying anaesthesia) and Posner molecule research suggest quantum processes may play roles in neural function. If confirmed and characterised, these would identify the physical side of the control law's output variables.

**Neurophenomenology.** First-person reports of effort, attention, and intention—calibrated against neural measurements—could constrain the phenomenal side. Francisco Varela's neurophenomenological programme sought exactly this integration. Advances in real-time brain imaging correlated with trained introspective reports might yield the phenomenal metrics a control law requires.

None of these alone delivers the control law. Together they narrow the space of possibilities from unconstrained speculation to empirically bounded conjecture.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The psychophysical control law is the specification gap at the centre of the Map's framework.

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]** creates the need for the law. If consciousness were identical to brain processes, no separate specification would be required—physics would suffice. Precisely because consciousness is ontologically distinct, the relationship must be lawfully specified.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]** requires that the law run downward: from phenomenal states to physical selections. Upward supervenience laws (Chalmers' primary contribution) specify how physics yields experience; the Map needs the other direction. The psychophysical control law *is* the bidirectional interaction tenet in operational form.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]** constrains the law's form. Whatever the mapping, it must operate within quantum indeterminacy—biasing rather than overriding physical outcomes. The ~10 bits/second bandwidth enforces this naturally: so little information flows through the channel that large-scale conservation violations are implausible.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]** makes the law meaningful. If all quantum outcomes actualise in parallel branches, there is nothing for a control law to govern—every output occurs regardless. Genuine selection requires genuine collapse, and a control law governs that selection.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]** addresses the complexity objection. A psychophysical control law adds to the fundamental furniture of nature. The justification: the alternative—denying that consciousness causally contributes—requires accepting that our reports about consciousness are accidentally correct, that effort is illusory, and that the conversation about consciousness is itself causally disconnected from consciousness. That is not simpler; it is more implausible.
