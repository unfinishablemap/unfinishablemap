The [[concepts/many-worlds|Many-Worlds Interpretation]] (MWI) is not the only scientifically respectable interpretation of quantum mechanics. A 2025 Nature survey found that only 36% of physicists favor Copenhagen interpretation, with no interpretation commanding majority support. The interpretive landscape remains genuinely open—and several alternatives don't exclude consciousness from participating in quantum measurement, directly supporting The Unfinishable Map's [[tenets#minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] and [[tenets#no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]] tenets.

**Honest limitation**: The fact that physics hasn't settled on one interpretation doesn't mean consciousness-based interpretations are well-supported—they remain a minority position among physicists. What it means is that the measurement problem remains genuinely unsolved, and consciousness-collapse proposals haven't been ruled out. The Map treats this as philosophical space to explore, not scientific consensus.

This article surveys five major alternatives to Many-Worlds: Copenhagen, Bohmian mechanics, QBism, transactional/time-symmetric interpretations, and objective collapse theories. Each handles the [[measurement-problem]] differently, and each has different implications for consciousness.

## Copenhagen Interpretation

The Copenhagen interpretation treats the wave function as representing knowledge rather than physical reality. Measurement causes collapse, but "measurement" remains undefined—a deliberate instrumentalist stance that avoids ontological commitments.

Von Neumann and Wigner later suggested consciousness might trigger collapse, though this was never standard Copenhagen. The interpretation's strength is empirical adequacy; its weakness is leaving the measurement problem fundamentally unsolved. This creates logical space for consciousness but doesn't explain it.

**Relation to the Map:** Copenhagen's instrumentalism conflicts with the Map's realist commitments about conscious states. But its openness about the measurement problem preserves possibilities that more committal interpretations foreclose. Note that "preserving possibilities" differs from "providing positive evidence"—Copenhagen doesn't support consciousness-collapse, it simply doesn't exclude it.

## Bohmian Mechanics (Pilot-Wave Theory)

Bohmian mechanics restores determinism by giving particles definite positions at all times, guided by a "pilot wave." The wave function evolves unitarily forever—there is no collapse. Apparent randomness reflects ignorance of initial conditions.

**Consciousness has no role.** Bohmian mechanics explicitly eliminates the observer from physics. Particles always have positions; we simply don't know them until measurement reveals pre-existing facts. The measurement problem dissolves because outcomes are determined by the pilot wave's guidance, not by observation.

The theory requires instantaneous non-local influences to explain entanglement, creating tension with special relativity. More critically for the Map, if Bohmian mechanics is correct, the [[tenets#minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet has no work to do. Consciousness cannot select outcomes because outcomes are already determined.

**Relation to the Map:** Low compatibility. Bohmian determinism makes free will phenomenology illusory. The Map takes the experience of effort and choice seriously—experiences that would be systematically misleading in a Bohmian universe. However, Bohmian mechanics has sophisticated defenders (notably Goldstein, Tumulka, and Zanghì) who argue its determinism is no more threatening to agency than classical physics, and that its ontological clarity compensates for other costs.

## QBism (Quantum Bayesianism)

QBism radically recenters quantum mechanics around agents. Quantum states represent an agent's degrees of belief, not objective reality. Probabilities are subjective (Bayesian), updated upon measurement. "Collapse" is simply belief update—not a physical process but an epistemic one.

Different agents can consistently assign different quantum states to the same system. There is no single shared reality described by the wave function; each agent has their own state assignments.

**Consciousness is paradoxically central yet unexplained.** QBism makes agents fundamental—only agents have quantum states (as beliefs). But because quantum states aren't real in QBism, there's nothing for consciousness to collapse. The agent's experience of measurement is epistemically foundational without being ontologically explained.

**Relation to the Map:** Mixed. QBism's agent-centrality echoes the Map's phenomenological emphasis and rejection of view-from-nowhere physicalism. But QBism's anti-realism about quantum states conflicts with the Map's commitment to real conscious states with causal powers. QBism sidesteps consciousness questions rather than answering them—making agents fundamental while deliberately remaining silent about what agents *are*. This may be principled humility (as its proponents argue) or an explanatory gap that requires filling. The [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|hard problem]] asks why agents have subjective experiences at all; QBism presupposes this without explaining it. See [[quantum-measurement-and-subjective-probability]] for a detailed analysis of how subjective probability interpretations fail phenomenologically—experience has determinate content that belief updating cannot ground.

## Transactional Interpretation and Time-Symmetric Approaches

The transactional interpretation (John Cramer, 1986) and two-state vector formalism (Aharonov, Bergmann, Lebowitz, 1964) treat quantum events as involving "handshakes" between forward-in-time (retarded) and backward-in-time (advanced) waves. A "transaction" between emitter and absorber constitutes measurement. Future boundary conditions matter as much as past ones.

**This is where [[retrocausality]] enters quantum mechanics directly.** In time-symmetric interpretations, consciousness need not cause collapse *at* a moment. Instead, it could participate atemporally in determining which correlations hold across time—selecting "which transaction completes" without being bound to a single temporal instant. This resonates with [[process-philosophy]]'s account of "actual occasions"—discrete moments where genuine novelty emerges through the resolution of potentiality into actuality. A transaction completing could be understood as an actual occasion: a moment of becoming that is neither purely determined by the past nor external to experience.

The [[collapse-and-time]] page already draws on this framework to resolve the [[libet-experiments|Libet problem]]: backward-in-time influences allow conscious decisions to affect neural precursors without violating the forward causal order we observe. Transactional interpretations provide the physical foundation for "atemporal selection."

**Important caveat**: While time-symmetric physics is well-established mathematically, how consciousness would "participate" in transactions remains unspecified. What physical substrate in neural tissue carries retrocausal influence? How would consciousness bias confirmation waves without violating Born statistics? These are open questions, not solved problems. The interpretation *permits* consciousness-involvement but doesn't *require* it.

**Relation to the Map:** High conceptual compatibility, though speculative. Time-symmetric interpretations align with the Map's use of retrocausality to preserve [[topics/free-will]]. They offer a *framework* for consciousness to influence quantum outcomes without requiring faster-than-light signaling or energy injection—but the specific mechanism remains unspecified. The Map considers this the most promising interpretation family for its purposes while acknowledging the framework is philosophical, not empirically established.

## Objective Collapse Theories

Objective collapse theories—GRW (Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber), CSL (Continuous Spontaneous Localization), and Penrose's gravitational collapse—treat wave function collapse as a real physical process occurring spontaneously. No observer is required; collapse happens at a certain rate or threshold according to modified dynamical laws.

**Standard versions give consciousness no direct role.** If collapse happens physically according to GRW/CSL parameters or gravitational thresholds, consciousness doesn't cause it. Collapse occurs whether anyone is conscious or not.

**But consciousness-integrated variants exist.** Proposals by Kremnizer and Ranchin (2015) and Okon and Sebastián (2016) modify CSL so that integrated information (Φ from [[integrated-information-theory|IIT]]) affects collapse rate or operator choice. Consciousness doesn't cause collapse but *modulates* it—higher consciousness yields faster or more stable collapse.

Penrose-Hameroff's [[quantum-consciousness#Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch OR)|Orch OR]] proposes that objective reduction occurs at a gravitational threshold, but consciousness is what the reduction *produces* rather than what causes it. This inverts the usual causal picture: collapse doesn't result from consciousness; consciousness results from collapse.

**Relation to the Map:** Moderate to high compatibility, depending on variant. Standard GRW/CSL don't require consciousness but are compatible with consciousness having a modulatory role. Consciousness-integrated CSL variants align closely with [[tenets#minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]. Penrose's view—collapse produces consciousness—differs from the Map's [[tenets#bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] commitment but could be integrated if consciousness feeds back on subsequent collapses.

## Why This Matters for the Map

The Map's [[tenets#no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]] tenet explicitly rejects MWI. But that rejection only makes sense if viable alternatives exist. This article establishes that they do—and that several don't exclude consciousness from participating in quantum measurement.

The interpretive landscape is genuinely open. Only 24% of physicists in the 2025 Nature survey were confident their preferred interpretation was correct. Physics has not settled on determinism (Bohm) or on observer-independence (objective collapse) or on anti-realism (QBism). The question remains: which interpretation best explains both quantum phenomena and the existence of consciousness?

**The critical distinction**: Interpretations that "leave room" for consciousness don't thereby *support* consciousness-based theories—they simply don't exclude them. This matters because the Map doesn't claim physics has established consciousness's role in collapse; it claims physics hasn't ruled it out.

**The indexical dimension**: As explored in [[quantum-measurement-and-subjective-probability]], Born probabilities may be fundamentally about what conscious subjects will experience—not "probability that spin-up occurs" but "probability that *I* experience spin-up." If this indexical reading is correct, the first-person perspective isn't an afterthought to quantum mechanics; it's built into the foundations.

The Map's advantage is taking consciousness seriously as an explanatory target, not just as a philosophical add-on. Interpretations that eliminate consciousness (Bohmian), treat it as purely epistemic (QBism), or ignore it (standard GRW/CSL) don't explain why consciousness exists at all. But this criticism applies equally to consciousness-collapse theories—they *use* consciousness as an explainer without explaining what consciousness *is*. The Map's response: this is the [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|hard problem]], and it affects all interpretations equally. At least consciousness-collapse theories don't add the further problem of making consciousness epiphenomenal.

## Relation to Site Perspective

This article directly supports the [[tenets#no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]] tenet by demonstrating that MWI is not the only scientifically respectable option. Physicists are divided, with no consensus. The Map can confidently reject Many-Worlds without being scientifically irresponsible.

**Engaging MWI's strongest responses**: The Map's indexical objection to MWI ("why am I this branch?") has been addressed by Wallace and Saunders through "self-locating uncertainty"—the idea that branch-selves are simply uncertain about which branch they occupy. The Map's response: self-locating uncertainty presupposes there's a fact about "where I am" to be uncertain about, which is precisely what needs grounding. MWI defenders respond that "I" just means "this branch-copy," making the question trivial. The disagreement is deep and unresolved: MWI dissolves the indexical question where the Map holds it must be answered. See [[concepts/many-worlds]] for detailed treatment.

More importantly, several alternatives—particularly time-symmetric interpretations—provide conceptual frameworks for [[tenets#minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]. The idea that consciousness biases quantum outcomes without injecting energy is a coherent hypothesis that physics hasn't ruled out. It's not mainstream, but it's not pseudoscience either—serious researchers (Stapp, Penrose, Kastner) have developed formal frameworks.

The Map's [[tenets#bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] commitment requires some mechanism by which consciousness influences matter. Quantum indeterminacy provides that mechanism. This article shows the physics leaves room: collapse interpretations remain viable, consciousness-integrated variants are scientifically coherent, and the measurement problem remains unsolved.

Finally, rejecting Bohmian determinism preserves the phenomenological legitimacy of free will experience. The Map doesn't need to explain away the feeling of choice as systematic illusion. Time-symmetric quantum mechanics provides a framework where that feeling could track metaphysical reality.
