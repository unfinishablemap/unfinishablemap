**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None identified.

### Medium Issues Found
- **"Delivered 1893–1917" factual inaccuracy**: The lectures were delivered in 1904–1905; the date range 1893–1917 refers to the manuscripts compiled in Husserliana X. Resolution: Reworded to "delivered as lectures in 1904–1905 and developed through manuscripts spanning 1893–1917."
- **Husserl title inconsistency**: Body text said "Lectures on the Phenomenology..." while reference cited "On the Phenomenology..." (the Brough translation). Resolution: Body text reworded to avoid citing a specific title; reference parenthetical clarified.
- **Conflation of protention with active deliberation**: Article blurred Husserl's distinction between passive protention and higher-order active acts. Resolution: Added qualifier explaining that deliberation involves higher-order acts operating upon the passive protentional flow, noting the debate in Husserl scholarship.
- **"Temporal quale" without justification**: Extended qualia terminology to structural features of experience without argument. Resolution: Added brief argument — "Just as redness is a sensory quale and painfulness an affective quale, forward-directedness is a temporal quale."
- **No Many Worlds connection overstated**: Claimed protention "presupposes a single anticipated future," mischaracterizing Husserl's horizon of possibilities. Resolution: Rewritten to acknowledge that protention opens toward a horizon of possibilities but is structured around actualisation and convergence, not branching proliferation.
- **Missing engagement with active inference**: Only addressed older predictive processing. Resolution: Added sentence engaging Friston's active inference framework directly, noting it accounts for forward-directed behaviour without addressing phenomenology.
- **Dangling cross-references**: `specious-present`, `duration`, `temporal-asymmetry-remembering-anticipating`, `temporal-structure-of-consciousness` linked to non-existent files. Resolution: Removed from frontmatter; replaced body wikilinks with plain text or corrected to existing articles (e.g., `consciousness-and-temporal-asymmetry`).
- **Whitehead panpsychism tension unaddressed**: Borrowed subjective aim framework while rejecting panpsychism without explanation. Resolution: Added sentence noting the Map holds experiential protention arises only in systems with supporting neural architecture.
- **Gallagher page numbers**: Listed as 420–438 but bibliographic records show 419–437. Resolution: Corrected to 419–437.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Active inference as stronger physicalist account**: Addressed by engaging the framework directly while noting it still misses phenomenology.
- **Protention as horizon of possibilities vs. singular future**: Addressed by rewriting No Many Worlds tenet connection.
- **Why subjective aim produces protention only in conscious beings**: Addressed in Whitehead section.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- The protention-prediction distinction and zombie argument applied to anticipation
- "Empty yet shaped, like an open question rather than a fading answer" (retained with enriched context)
- The specious present connection — forward momentum preventing "a trailing smear of fading past"
- The passive/active protention distinction in the agency section (now with Husserlian qualifications)
- The prehension/subjective aim dual mapping to retention/protention
- All five tenet connections (No Many Worlds substantially improved)

### Enhancements Made
- Added engagement with active inference framework
- Qualified protention's "emptiness" — now described as shaped by retained context
- Justified "temporal quale" terminology with analogical argument
- Clarified Husserl's passive/active synthesis levels
- Addressed Whitehead panpsychism divergence explicitly
- Rewrote No Many Worlds connection with phenomenological nuance
- Fixed factual details (lecture dates, page numbers, title consistency)

### Cross-links Added
- [[consciousness-and-temporal-asymmetry]] (replacing broken temporal-asymmetry-remembering-anticipating)
- [[time-collapse-and-agency]] (added to Further Reading)
- [[explanatory-gap]] (added to frontmatter concepts)
- [[philosophical-zombies]] (added to frontmatter concepts)
- [[agent-causation]] (added to frontmatter concepts)

### Cross-links Removed (dangling)
- `specious-present` (no article exists)
- `duration` (no article exists)
- `temporal-structure-of-consciousness` (no article exists)

## Remaining Items

- The substantial overlap with `phenomenology-of-anticipation` was noted but not addressed in this review — the two articles share the melody example, zombie argument, and Whitehead connection. A future review or coalesce task could differentiate them more sharply.
- Expansion opportunities from optimistic review (embodied protention, contemplative evidence, surprise as negative portrait) were not pursued to keep within length-neutral operation for a concept article.

## Stability Notes

- The adversarial personas' philosophical disagreements (eliminative materialist rejecting qualia, MWI defender finding the No Many Worlds argument unsatisfying, empiricist wanting more testable predictions) are bedrock disagreements reflecting the Map's committed dualist perspective. Future reviews should NOT re-flag these as critical.
- The tension between borrowing from Whitehead and rejecting panpsychism is now acknowledged; this is a genuine philosophical challenge for any interactionist dualism, not a fixable error.
- The "temporal quale" extension will remain contested by those who restrict qualia to sensory properties; the article now provides an argument rather than an assertion.
