**Date**: 2026-02-27
**Article**: [[tenet-generated-voids|Tenet-Generated Voids]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-24c-tenet-generated-voids|2026-02-24]]

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Six adversarial personas engaged with the content. Context: cross-review in light of new `dissolution-problem` article.

1. **Eliminative Materialist**: No new issues. Self-inflicted-voids critique remains bedrock disagreement. *Stable across five reviews.*
2. **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: The dissolution-problem provides Dennett ammunition—classifying voids as "Unexplorable" based on persistence has a bad historical track record. The "What Would Challenge" section already hedges ("doesn't claim the voids are permanent"), but the "Nature of These Limits" section was more confident. **Medium issue**: added dissolution-problem qualification. *Resolved.*
3. **Quantum Skeptic**: No change. Mechanism Void stable.
4. **Many-Worlds Defender**: No change. Selection Void stable.
5. **Empiricist**: Dissolution-problem's emphasis on the reference class problem doesn't create new issues—article already acknowledges Detection Void honestly. *Stable.*
6. **Buddhist Philosopher**: No new issues.

### Critical Issues Found
None. Fifth consecutive review with no critical issues.

### Medium Issues Found
- **"Unexplorable" classification unqualified**: The "Nature of These Limits" section classified voids as "predominantly Unexplorable" without acknowledging the dissolution-problem's asymmetry argument (persistence ≠ proof of permanence). *Resolution*: Added parenthetical cross-reference to `[[dissolution-problem]]` qualifying the claim.
- **Missing cross-link to dissolution-problem**: New void article directly addresses the reliability of void classification. *Resolution*: Added to "Nature of These Limits" section, Further Reading, and related_articles.

### Counterarguments Considered
All counterarguments from previous reviews remain bedrock disagreements. The dissolution-problem adds nuance to the "Unexplorable" classification but the article already contained the "What Would Challenge This Analysis?" section as a hedge.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

Six sympathetic personas identified strengths:

1. **Property Dualist**: The dissolution-problem's "structural signatures" framework actually supports the classification—the five voids score high on persistent-limit indicators (self-reference, cross-cultural recurrence, stable positions rather than progressive research)
2. **Quantum Mind Theorist**: No specific insights from dissolution-problem
3. **Phenomenologist**: Dissolution-problem's psychological/cognitive closure distinction adds nuance to Nature Void, but Further Reading link is sufficient
4. **Process Philosopher**: No specific insights
5. **Libertarian Free Will Defender**: No specific insights
6. **Mysterian**: Dissolution-problem's discussion of McGinn's cognitive closure reinforces the "Unexplorable" classification; cross-link makes this support explicit

### Strengths Preserved
- Five-void/five-tenet parallel structure
- "What the tenet says / What it cannot answer" format
- Phenomenological grounding in Nature Void section
- Honest self-critique (Epistemic Privilege Void)
- Reflexive structure in Relation to Site Perspective
- "What Would Challenge This Analysis?" section — already anticipates the dissolution-problem's core concern

### Enhancements Made
- Added dissolution-problem qualification to "Unexplorable" classification in "Nature of These Limits"
- Added `[[dissolution-problem]]` to Further Reading and related_articles
- Tightened Mechanism Void prose: removed redundant detail from candidate mechanisms list and consolidated placeholder paragraph
- Tightened Coherence Void: removed redundant clause, consolidated Gödelian reference

### Cross-links Added
- [[dissolution-problem]]

## Length Management

- **Before**: 1972 words (99% of 2000 soft threshold)
- **After**: 1972 words (99% of 2000 soft threshold)
- **Mode**: Length-neutral — additions balanced with prose tightening
- Trimmed: Mechanism Void candidates list (removed "in microtubules" and "with mental attention as repeated observation"), Mechanism Void placeholder paragraph consolidated, Coherence Void tightened

## Remaining Items

None.

## Stability Notes

This is the fifth review finding no critical issues. The article is fully stable.

All bedrock disagreements from previous reviews remain unchanged:
- **Eliminative materialist objection**: Self-inflicted voids — fundamental disagreement
- **MWI defender objection**: Indexical questions as manufactured — different metaphysical framework
- **Buddhist non-self objection**: Competing ontology, not article flaw
- **Divine hiddenness parallel**: Article acknowledges the suspicion honestly
- **Epistemic Privilege Void**: Transparency vs. hiding resolution remains adequate

**Future review guidance**: This article has been reviewed five times. It is fully stable. The dissolution-problem cross-link completes the connection to the voids ecosystem. Future reviews should only occur when genuinely new content creates cross-linking opportunities. Do not re-examine the five-void/five-tenet mapping, cross-tenet voids, or philosophical foundations.
