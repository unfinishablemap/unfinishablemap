**Date**: 2026-02-25
**Article**: [[ownership-void|The Ownership Void]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. All attributions verified (Zahavi, Heidegger, Billon, Ciaunica, Gallagher, Knappik, Metzinger, Deane et al.). No source/Map conflation, no self-contradictions, no misattributions.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Dualist opacity claim underargued**: The Metzinger section asserted dualist opacity "may run even deeper" without supporting reasoning. Resolution: Added a sentence explaining that physical systems can in principle be analyzed from outside while a non-physical subject has no external vantage point.
- **Missing cross-link to consciousness-and-the-ownership-problem**: The most directly related topic article was not linked. Resolution: Added link in body text (Peculiar Recursion section) and Further Reading.
- **Orphan status (0 inbound links)**: Despite connecting to 8+ closely related articles via outbound links, no articles linked back. Resolution: Added inbound links from 8 articles (see Cross-links Added below).

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative Materialist**: Folk-psychological "ownership" may not carve nature at its joints. Expected philosophical disagreement — the article's case rests on phenomenological evidence (DPD, clinical dissociations) rather than folk intuition.
- **Dennett-style functionalist**: The dualist account merely relocates the mystery of ownership. The article now provides additional reasoning for why dualist opacity differs structurally.
- **Buddhist (Nagarjuna)**: The anattā description simplifies to Theravāda vipassanā. Acceptable for scope — the article correctly notes the phenomenological divergence (terror vs. equanimity) and does not claim to represent all Buddhist approaches.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent front-loaded opening paragraph with core concept clearly stated
- Clean distinctions from neighboring voids (unobservable self, introspective opacity, self-reference paradox)
- Well-integrated DPD evidence (Billon, Ciaunica, Knappik)
- Balanced Metzinger treatment — acknowledges structural insight while rejecting physicalist framework
- Original contemplative section connecting DPD and meditation via active inference (Deane et al.)
- "Affective divergence" observation (same void, different phenomenal valence) is a novel contribution
- Solid reference list with 9 verifiable academic sources

### Enhancements Made
- Strengthened dualist opacity argument in Metzinger section (1 sentence added)
- Added paragraph in Peculiar Recursion section connecting to the broader ownership problem
- Added consciousness-and-the-ownership-problem and self-consciousness to Further Reading
- Updated frontmatter with new related_articles

### Cross-links Added (Orphan Integration)
Inbound links added from 8 articles:
- [[consciousness-and-the-ownership-problem]] — body text (Ownership as Primitive section) + Further Reading + related_articles
- [[self-and-consciousness]] — Further Reading + related_articles
- [[phenomenological-psychiatry-and-altered-experience]] — body text (DPD mineness bullet) + Further Reading + related_articles
- [[existentialism]] — body text (Jemeinigkeit paragraph) + Further Reading + related_articles
- [[phenomenology-of-agency-vs-passivity]] — body text (Ownership Without Agency section) + Further Reading + related_articles
- [[the-unobservable-self]] — Further Reading + related_articles
- [[introspective-opacity]] — body text (opening distinction paragraph) + Further Reading + related_articles
- [[self-consciousness]] — Further Reading + related_articles

## Remaining Items

None. All medium issues were addressed. The article is now well-integrated into the site's navigation structure with 8 inbound links from related content.

## Stability Notes

- The six adversarial personas' philosophical objections (eliminative materialist, functionalist, etc.) represent expected disagreements with the Map's dualist framework. These are bedrock philosophical differences, not fixable flaws.
- The Buddhist anattā simplification is acceptable for a void article focused on phenomenological opacity rather than comparative philosophy.
- Article is at 1611 words (81% of 2000 soft threshold) — healthy length with room for future additions without triggering length-neutral mode.
