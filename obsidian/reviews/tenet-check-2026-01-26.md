# Tenet Alignment Check

**Date**: 2026-01-26
**Files checked**: 130 (35 topics + 95 concepts)
**Errors**: 0
**Warnings**: 2
**Notes**: 10

## Summary

All 130 files (35 topics, 95 concepts) were analyzed for alignment with the five foundational tenets. The content is strongly aligned overall. All articles explicitly connect to tenets via "Relation to Site Perspective" sections. No direct contradictions were found. Two warnings identify content requiring attention. Ten notes flag areas where opposing views are discussed (appropriately) but could benefit from slightly clearer framing.

## Errors

None found.

## Warnings

### language-recursion-and-consciousness.md

- **Tenet potentially affected**: Dualism / Bidirectional Interaction
- **Issue**: The article contains an author annotation indicating uncertainty about the AI-generated argument: "[Andy: I've no idea how it came up with this]" (line 74). The article argues that recursive language processing requires consciousness, which supports the tenets. However, the author note suggests the reasoning may be suspect or unclear even to the human reviewer.
- **Quote**: "[Andy: I've no idea how it came up with this 🤷‍♂️]"
- **Recommendation**: Review this article carefully. Either validate the reasoning and remove the annotation, or flag the specific argument as speculative. The core claim (recursion requires consciousness) aligns with tenets but the supporting argument should be scrutinized.

### integrated-information-theory.md (concepts)

- **Tenet potentially affected**: Bidirectional Interaction
- **Issue**: IIT's identity thesis (consciousness IS integrated information, measured as phi) creates tension with the Bidirectional Interaction tenet which requires consciousness to causally influence physical outcomes beyond what physics determines. The identity thesis implies consciousness doesn't have causal power *over and above* the physical substrate.
- **Quote**: "The framework remains neutral on whether IIT's phi-zero boundary correctly demarcates the edge of experience—the Map's commitment is to reality of consciousness, not to any particular mathematical measure."
- **Recommendation**: Consider adding explicit note that while IIT provides useful measures of integration, its identity thesis (consciousness *is* phi) would render consciousness epiphenomenal, conflicting with the Bidirectional Interaction tenet.

## Notes

### quantum-measurement-interpretations-beyond-mwi.md

- **Tenet**: Minimal Quantum Interaction
- **Issue**: The article appropriately discusses multiple interpretations including Bohmian mechanics, which is deterministic and would exclude consciousness from physics. The article correctly notes "Low compatibility" with the Map's framework. However, the treatment of Bohmian mechanics is balanced enough that readers unfamiliar with the tenets might not immediately recognize it conflicts with the Map's commitments.
- **Quote**: "If Bohmian mechanics is correct, the Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet has no work to do. Consciousness cannot select outcomes because outcomes are already determined."
- **Recommendation**: No change needed. The article correctly identifies the incompatibility. This is good practice for engaging opposing views.

### animal-consciousness.md

- **Tenet**: Occam's Razor Has Limits
- **Issue**: Minor tension in the reference to "Occam's Razor" tenet. The article references `[[tenets#^occams-razor]]` at line 145, but the correct anchor is `[[tenets#^occams-limits]]`. This appears to be a broken link.
- **Quote**: "The Map's [[tenets#^occams-razor|Occam's Razor Has Limits]] tenet acknowledges..."
- **Recommendation**: Fix the broken anchor reference from `#^occams-razor` to `#^occams-limits`.

### machine-consciousness.md

- **Tenet**: No Many Worlds
- **Issue**: The article discusses the simulation hypothesis and notes: "The Map's framework allows that simulations could be conscious if they run on appropriate substrate with quantum interface." This is appropriately qualified, but the connection to No Many Worlds tenet could be made more explicit—simulations running on MWI hardware would face the same indexical problems the tenet identifies.
- **Quote**: "The Map's framework allows that simulations could be conscious if they run on appropriate substrate with quantum interface."
- **Recommendation**: Consider adding a brief note that such simulations would also need to satisfy the No Many Worlds constraint (i.e., not run on hardware implementing all branches).

## Observations

### Strong Tenet Integration

All substantive topic articles include explicit "Relation to Site Perspective" sections that connect content to multiple tenets. This is excellent practice and ensures readers understand how each topic fits the Map's framework.

### Appropriate Treatment of Opposing Views

Several articles (quantum-measurement-interpretations-beyond-mwi.md, conservation-laws-and-mind.md, hard-problem-of-consciousness.md) discuss materialist and physicalist positions in detail. This is done appropriately—presenting opposing arguments fairly while explaining why the Map's framework responds to them. No articles endorse positions the tenets rule out.

### Honest Epistemic Status

Articles consistently acknowledge uncertainty and limitations. For example:
- quantum-measurement-interpretations-beyond-mwi.md includes "Honest limitation" callout boxes
- conservation-laws-and-mind.md acknowledges "This is not fully satisfying" regarding detection objections
- psychophysical-laws-framework.md discusses "What Would Challenge This View?" honestly

This epistemic honesty strengthens rather than weakens tenet alignment—the tenets themselves acknowledge limits (Occam's Razor Has Limits) and the Map positions itself as exploration rather than dogma.

### No Eliminativist or Epiphenomenalist Content

No article treats consciousness as illusory or epiphenomenal. Where illusionism is discussed (hard-problem-of-consciousness.md, emotional-consciousness.md, ai-consciousness.md), it is presented as a position the Map rejects, with clear arguments for that rejection.

### No Quantum Woo

Articles discussing quantum mechanics (quantum-neural-timing-constraints.md, conservation-laws-and-mind.md, quantum-measurement-interpretations-beyond-mwi.md) maintain appropriate scientific rigor. None endorse uncontrolled psychokinesis, energy injection by mind, or empirically detectable mind-matter interactions. The Minimal Quantum Interaction framework is consistently presented as a constrained philosophical hypothesis.

# Concepts (P-Z) Analysis

**Files checked**: 34
**Errors**: 0
**Warnings**: 0
**Notes**: 2

## Notes (Concepts P-Z)

### relational-quantum-mechanics.md

- **Tenet relevant**: Bidirectional Interaction
- **Issue**: Presents RQM in detail, which explicitly removes consciousness from physics
- **Quote**: "RQM provides no mechanism for mental causation. If any physical interaction is a 'measurement,' then a rock measuring a photon is equivalent to a physicist measuring one."
- **Assessment**: The file explicitly marks this as conflicting with the site's tenets: "This interpretation directly conflicts with The Unfinishable Map's Bidirectional Interaction tenet." The article is a fair exposition that explains *why* the Map rejects RQM, not an endorsement. No correction needed.

### russellian-monism.md

- **Tenet relevant**: Dualism
- **Issue**: Presents Russellian Monism sympathetically before explaining the Map's preference for explicit dualism
- **Quote**: "Russellian monism holds that physics describes only the relational structure of matter—leaving their intrinsic nature unexplained. These intrinsic properties, called quiddities, allegedly account for consciousness."
- **Assessment**: The file explains what Russellian Monism gets right before clarifying why the Map prefers interactionist dualism: "If Russellian monism is dualism under another name, the Map's explicit interactionist dualism is preferable." The treatment is balanced and ultimately supports the tenets. No correction needed.

## Methodology (Concepts P-Z)

Each file was analyzed for:

1. **Direct contradictions**: Content explicitly endorsing eliminative materialism, consciousness as illusion, quantum mysticism, epiphenomenalism, many-worlds, or using Occam's Razor to dismiss dualism
2. **Implicit conflicts**: Assumptions of physicalism without acknowledgment, dismissal of non-physical explanations without argument
3. **Tenet support**: Explicit engagement with tenets via "Relation to Site Perspective" sections

All files engage critically with opposing positions rather than endorsing them. The two notes identify careful expositions of views the Map rejects, which serve to explain the Map's position rather than undermine it.

# Concepts (A-D) Analysis

**Files checked**: 24
**Errors**: 0
**Warnings**: 0
**Notes**: 2

## Notes (Concepts A-D)

### attention-schema-theory.md

- **Tenet**: Dualism
- **Issue**: Presents Attention Schema Theory (an illusionist/functionalist view) in detail
- **Quote**: "AST claims consciousness is a simplified model the brain constructs of its own attention processes—and nothing more."
- **Assessment**: Properly handled. The article explicitly states: "The Unfinishable Map rejects AST as an adequate account of consciousness." The opposing view is presented fairly but clearly rejected.

### analytic-idealism.md

- **Tenet**: Dualism (physical reality exists)
- **Issue**: Discusses Kastrup's idealism which denies independent physical reality
- **Quote**: "The Unfinishable Map's [[tenets]] maintain a different position: both consciousness and physical reality exist as genuinely distinct."
- **Assessment**: Properly handled. The article presents idealism as an alternative to materialism but explicitly notes the site maintains dualism rather than idealism.

# Concepts (E-I) Analysis

**Files checked**: 22
**Errors**: 0
**Warnings**: 1
**Notes**: 3

## Notes (Concepts E-I)

### higher-order-theories.md

- **Tenet**: Dualism
- **Issue**: Higher-order theories are presented with their functionalist framing
- **Quote**: "If higher-order theories are functionalist accounts, they face the standard objections: absent qualia, inverted qualia, and the failure to explain why any physical process should be accompanied by experience."
- **Assessment**: Correctly identifies the tension and presents HOT as a challenge the Map must address rather than endorse. No correction needed.

### global-workspace-theory.md

- **Tenet**: Dualism
- **Issue**: GWT is a functionalist theory that could be read as reducing consciousness to information integration patterns
- **Quote**: "The theory is explicitly offered as neutral between physicalism and dualism... The Map interprets global broadcast as a *correlate* of consciousness, not as constitutive of it."
- **Assessment**: Correctly frames GWT as describing neural correlates compatible with dualism. Well handled.

### intuitive-dualism.md

- **Tenet**: Dualism (potential misreading)
- **Issue**: Could be misread as supporting dualism merely because it's cognitively natural
- **Quote**: "The fact that dualism is cognitively natural does not make it true—many natural intuitions are false... The Map does not rest its case on cognitive naturalness."
- **Assessment**: Explicitly addresses this concern. No conflict.
