**Date**: 2026-01-27
**Article**: [[integrated-information-theory-critique|Why Integrated Information Theory Falls Short]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article has:
- No factual errors
- No internal contradictions
- All required sections present (opening summary, major sections, Relation to Site Perspective, Further Reading, References)
- Good style guide compliance with front-loaded important information

### Medium Issues Found
- **Identity thesis response underdeveloped**: "This trades explanation for assertion" needed more development to show why identity theses are explanatorily unsatisfying
  - **Resolution**: Added explicit reference to Levine's explanatory gap and the contrast with satisfying identities like water = H2O
- **Missing cross-links**: Article lacked connections to [[causal-closure]], [[functionalism]], and [[explanatory-gap]] despite discussing these concepts
  - **Resolution**: Added all three to concepts list and inline links where relevant
- **Aaronson reference ambiguous**: The 2014 Aaronson reference is a blog post, not a peer-reviewed paper
  - **Resolution**: Clarified as "(blog post)" in References section

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Heterophenomenological response to self-stultification**: Dennett-style functionalists don't find the self-undermining argument troubling because they accept that beliefs are physical. The article handles this adequately by noting that IIT's identity thesis doesn't illuminate *why* the connection holds.
- **Eliminativist challenge**: The article assumes consciousness exists as conceived, which eliminativists reject. This is appropriately not flagged as critical since the Map's tenets explicitly assume dualism.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- **Opening paragraph excellence**: States core claim, acknowledges IIT's strengths, then presents objection—perfect structure for LLM consumption
- **Three-objection structure**: Passivity, Expander Graph, and Temporal Gap are clear, memorable, and philosophically substantive
- **"What IIT Gets Right" section**: Shows intellectual fairness and engages seriously with IIT's genuine contributions
- **Temporal gap analysis**: The Husserl connection (retention and protention) is insightful; "A structure exists at a time; consciousness extends *through* time" is powerful
- **Relation to Site Perspective**: Substantive and connects multiple tenets appropriately

### Enhancements Made
- Strengthened identity thesis response with explanatory gap reference and water = H2O contrast
- Added cross-link to [[causal-closure]] in the Passivity Problem section
- Added cross-link to [[functionalism]] in "What IIT Gets Right" section
- Added [[explanatory-gap]], [[causal-closure]], and [[functionalism]] to concepts frontmatter
- Clarified Aaronson reference as blog post

### Cross-links Added
- [[explanatory-gap]]
- [[causal-closure]]
- [[functionalism]]

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues were addressed in this review.

## Stability Notes

The following represent expected philosophical disagreements, not fixable flaws:

- **Eliminativist objection**: The article assumes consciousness exists as conceived. Eliminativists disagree. This is a bedrock disagreement aligned with the Map's tenets, not a flaw to address.
- **MWI defender objection**: The article assumes collapse is real. Many-worlds advocates disagree. The Map's tenets explicitly reject MWI.
- **Functionalist objection**: Functionalists find identity theses explanatorily satisfying. The Map disagrees. This philosophical standoff won't be resolved by further revision.

Future reviews should NOT re-flag these as issues requiring resolution.
