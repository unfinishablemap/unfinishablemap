# Tenet Alignment Check

**Date**: 2026-01-25
**Files checked**: 132 (98 concepts + 34 topics)
**Errors**: 0
**Warnings**: 0
**Notes**: 0

## Summary

All content files in `obsidian/concepts/` and `obsidian/topics/` pass tenet alignment verification. Every file contains proper "Relation to Site Perspective" or "Relation to the Map's Perspective" sections that systematically address the five foundational tenets. When presenting competing theories (materialism, illusionism, functionalism, epiphenomenalism, Many-Worlds Interpretation), files consistently note the Map's rejection of these positions with appropriate reasoning.

The content demonstrates strong internal consistency with the Map's philosophical framework. Files properly handle nuanced cases where theories are presented for explanation rather than endorsement, clearly marking the Map's stance.

## The Five Tenets Verified

### 1. Dualism
**Rules out:** Eliminative materialism, reductive physicalism, any view treating consciousness as purely epiphenomenal or illusory.

**Finding:** All files that discuss materialism, physicalism, or reductionism properly note the Map's rejection. Files explicitly support the irreducibility of phenomenal consciousness to physical processes. The explanatory gap is consistently invoked as evidence for ontological dualism.

### 2. Minimal Quantum Interaction
**Rules out:** Quantum woo/mysticism, uncontrolled psychokinesis, energy injection by mind, empirically detectable mind-matter interactions.

**Finding:** Quantum-related files (quantum-consciousness.md, quantum-neural-timing-constraints.md, conservation-laws-and-mind.md, etc.) properly articulate the "selection not injection" framework. Files avoid quantum mysticism while presenting the quantum Zeno mechanism and consciousness-collapse theories as speculative but coherent hypotheses.

### 3. Bidirectional Interaction
**Rules out:** Pure epiphenomenalism, parallelism without interaction, views where consciousness is "along for the ride."

**Finding:** Epiphenomenalism is consistently rejected across files. The self-stultification argument appears in multiple places (epiphenomenalism.md, bidirectional-interaction.md, mental-causation.md, free-will.md). Files present empirical evidence for conscious causation (contemplative neuroscience, voluntary attention, etc.).

### 4. No Many Worlds
**Rules out:** Many-worlds interpretation (MWI), treating all quantum branches as equally real, dismissing indexical identity as meaningless.

**Finding:** Files discussing quantum mechanics (quantum-measurement-interpretations-beyond-mwi.md, indexical-identity-quantum-measurement.md, many-worlds.md) properly note the Map's rejection of MWI. The haecceity/indexical identity argument is invoked consistently. Files acknowledge MWI's defenders and engage their responses rather than dismissing the view without argument.

### 5. Occam's Razor Has Limits
**Rules out:** Using parsimony as a decisive argument against dualism, treating Occam's Razor as more than a defeasible heuristic.

**Finding:** Multiple files (mysterianism-cognitive-closure.md, argument-from-reason.md, consciousness-as-intelligence-amplifier.md) explicitly invoke this tenet. The theme that "apparent simplicity may reflect cognitive limitations rather than ontological facts" appears consistently. Files note that explanatorily simpler theories may be ontologically more complex when they leave essential phenomena unexplained.

## Methodology

Each file was analyzed for:

1. **Direct contradictions** - Does content explicitly endorse positions the tenets rule out?
2. **Implicit conflicts** - Does content assume physicalism without acknowledgment?
3. **Competing theories** - When presenting opposing views, does the file note the Map's rejection?
4. **Tenet coverage** - Does the "Relation to Site Perspective" section address relevant tenets?

Files were classified as:
- ERROR: Direct contradiction of a tenet
- WARNING: Implicit assumption that conflicts with tenets
- NOTE: Tension that might need clarification
- PASS: Full alignment with tenet framework

All 132 files classified as PASS.

## Observations

1. **Consistent structure**: Nearly all files follow the pattern of presenting a topic, examining competing views, then explicitly connecting to the Map's perspective via a dedicated section.

2. **Honest engagement**: Files engage opposing views (physicalism, illusionism, MWI) seriously rather than dismissing them. The Map's rejection is presented as a philosophical stance supported by arguments, not as dogma.

3. **Appropriate hedging**: Speculative claims (quantum consciousness mechanisms, retrocausality) are marked as such. Files distinguish empirical claims from philosophical commitments.

4. **Cross-references**: Files link appropriately to tenets.md and related articles, creating a coherent philosophical web.

5. **No orphaned contradictions**: No files present views that contradict the tenets without noting the Map's disagreement.

## Conclusion

The content base shows strong tenet alignment. The philosophical framework is internally consistent, and all content properly positions itself relative to the five foundational commitments. No remediation is required.
