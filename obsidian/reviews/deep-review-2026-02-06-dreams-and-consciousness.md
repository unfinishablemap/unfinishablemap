**Date**: 2026-02-06
**Article**: [[dreams-and-consciousness|Dreams and Consciousness]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-03-dreams-and-consciousness|2026-02-03]]
**Context**: Cross-review considering dreams-problem-solving-and-consciousness insights

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article has been reviewed three times previously and is approaching stability.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **No cross-link to the new dreams-problem-solving-and-consciousness article**
   - The new topic article establishes dream problem-solving as strong evidence for consciousness's causal efficacy during sleep (Konkoly 2026: 42% vs 17% solving rates for dream-incorporated puzzles)
   - The "What Dreams Reveal" section discussed generative capacity, optical constraints, transcendence of physical laws, and dissociation of components—but not problem-solving
   - Resolution: Added "Problem-solving capacity" paragraph to "What Dreams Reveal" with cross-reference to the new article

2. **Missing related_articles link**
   - The new dreams-problem-solving-and-consciousness article directly references this concept article but the reverse link was absent
   - Resolution: Added to frontmatter related_articles and Further Reading section

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Eliminative Materialist (Churchland)**: The filter theory interpretation and use of "generates" for consciousness remain philosophical disagreements with the Map's tenets, not fixable flaws. Previously flagged as bedrock disagreements.

- **Empiricist (Popper)**: The COGITATE study parenthetical (line 50) is brief but acceptable—it's a supporting detail, not a central claim. No action needed.

- **All six personas engaged**: No new critical or medium issues beyond the cross-linking gap that prompted this review. The article's philosophical arguments remain sound.

## Attribution Accuracy Check

All attributions verified:
- Demirel et al. (2025): Neural signatures and "stable third phase" quote correctly attributed
- LaBerge (1981): Signal-verified lucid dreaming correctly attributed
- Konkoly et al. (2021): Two-way communication correctly attributed
- Melloni et al. (2025): COGITATE study correctly attributed
- Norman Malcolm (1956): Logical contradiction argument correctly attributed
- Dennett "cassette theory": Standard attribution, correct
- Frankish quasi-phenomenal framework: Correctly attributed
- New addition — Konkoly et al. (2026): Dream problem-solving study correctly attributed with accurate statistics from the source article

No attribution errors found.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Strong opening summary front-loading the filter theory claim
- Well-structured consciousness gradient table (dreamless NREM → lucid REM)
- Effective illusionist challenge section with Frankish framework engagement
- Type-B physicalism cross-reference (added in previous review)
- Phenomenology of foreclosure argument in MWI section (added in previous review)
- Comprehensive "What Would Challenge This View" falsifiability section
- Good integration of predictive processing for dream bizarreness
- Appropriate quantum speculation hedging

### Enhancements Made
1. Added "Problem-solving capacity" paragraph to "What Dreams Reveal" section (~60 words)
2. Added [[dreams-problem-solving-and-consciousness]] to frontmatter related_articles
3. Added [[dreams-problem-solving-and-consciousness]] to Further Reading section
4. Added Konkoly et al. (2026) to References

### Cross-links Added
- [[dreams-problem-solving-and-consciousness]] (frontmatter + Further Reading + body text)

## Remaining Items

None. All medium issues addressed.

## Stability Notes

This is the fourth deep review of this article. Previous reviews addressed:
- Illusionist challenge (added in review 1, expanded with Frankish in review 2)
- MWI arguments (strengthened with foreclosure in review 3)
- Tibetan terminology (enriched in review 2)
- Quantum speculation hedging (added in review 2)
- Type-B physicalism cross-reference (added in review 3)
- REM/NREM percentage softening (review 3)

This review focused narrowly on integration with the new dreams-problem-solving-and-consciousness topic article. The article is stable. Future reviews should focus on:
- Checking factual accuracy as new dream research emerges
- Cross-linking with any future dream-related articles
- NOT re-opening philosophical arguments that represent bedrock disagreements
