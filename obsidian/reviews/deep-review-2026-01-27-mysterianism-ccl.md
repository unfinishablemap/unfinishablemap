# Deep Review: Mysterianism and Cognitive Closure

**Date**: 2026-01-27
**File**: obsidian/concepts/mysterianism.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-27 (earlier today)
**Cross-review context**: computational-cognitive-limits.md insights

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article was already in good shape from the earlier review today.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Formal vs. biological limits not distinguished**: The "Mathematical Understanding" section discussed Penrose but didn't clarify that computational limits (Gödel, Turing) are *mathematically proven* while McGinn's cognitive closure is a *hypothesis* about biology. **Resolution**: Rewrote the section to distinguish these two types of limits clearly and added link to [[computational-cognitive-limits]].

### Low Issues Found
None new.

### Counterarguments Considered
- All six adversarial personas engaged:
  - **Eliminative Materialist**: Bedrock disagreement (phenomenal consciousness may be confused concept)
  - **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: Response to defeatism objection is adequate
  - **Quantum Skeptic**: Penrose treated as argument, not established fact—appropriate
  - **Many-Worlds Defender**: MWI mentioned in tenet section—adequate for scope
  - **Empiricist**: Falsifiability section excellent
  - **Buddhist Philosopher**: Bedrock disagreement (substantialist framework); Process philosophy section partially addresses

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear opening paragraph explaining cognitive closure
- Compelling C. elegans empirical example
- Strong Nagel's bat treatment
- Excellent phenomenology-of-the-edge connection
- Full tenet coverage
- Good falsifiability conditions
- Intrinsic nature connection (from earlier review today)

### Enhancements Made
1. **Rewrote "Mathematical Understanding" section** to distinguish:
   - Computational limits (proven, apply to any algorithm)
   - Cognitive closure (proposed, human biology)
   - Added clarification on what follows if minds are/aren't computational
2. **Tightened Fodor paragraph** to offset additions (removed redundant phrases)
3. **Added cross-link** to [[computational-cognitive-limits]] in frontmatter and Further Reading

### Cross-links Added
- [[computational-cognitive-limits]] — New connection showing proven mathematical limits that complement McGinn's biological hypothesis

## Word Count
- Before: 2430 words (97% of 2500 soft threshold)
- After: 2476 words (99% of 2500 soft threshold)
- Net change: +46 words (still under threshold)

## Remaining Items

None. Article is now well-integrated with computational-cognitive-limits framework.

## Stability Notes

This is the **third deep review** of this article (2026-01-20, earlier 2026-01-27, this review). Key stability markers:

1. **Bedrock disagreements (do not re-flag)**:
   - Eliminativists will always question whether "phenomenal consciousness" is coherent
   - Buddhist philosophers will question the substantialist framework
   - These represent philosophical standoff, not article flaws

2. **Convergence achieved**:
   - 2026-01-20 review added: illusionism, process philosophy, falsifiability, full tenets
   - Earlier today added: intrinsic nature connection
   - This review added: computational limits distinction, bidirectional link to new voids article

3. **Article is at stability**:
   - All major philosophical positions engaged
   - All tenets covered
   - Cross-linked to relevant Map content including new computational-cognitive-limits article
   - Word count near threshold—further additions should require equivalent cuts
   - Future reviews should only address: new related content, significant literature developments, or broken links
