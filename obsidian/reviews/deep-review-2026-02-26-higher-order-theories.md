**Date**: 2026-02-26
**Article**: [[higher-order-theories|Higher-Order Theories of Consciousness]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-27-higher-order-theories|2026-01-27]]

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None identified

### Medium Issues Found
- **Stale `[[metarepresentation]]` wikilinks**: Four references to `[[metarepresentation]]` pointed to archived content (coalesced into metacognition on 2026-02-17). Updated all to `[[metacognition]]`. *Resolution*: Updated inline links at lines 59, 87 and Further Reading section; replaced `[[metarepresentation]]` with `[[blindsight]]` in concepts frontmatter (metacognition was already listed).
- **Uncited aPFC/tACS study**: Line 127 referenced "A 2025 study" without citation. *Resolution*: Softened to "Research using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)" to remove the uncited specific study claim while preserving the empirical argument.

### Low Issues Found
- Buddhist engagement remains somewhat instrumental (deferred from previous review, article above soft threshold)

### Counterarguments Considered
- All previously addressed counterarguments remain adequate (HOROR, illusionism, prefrontal prediction, dreaming, heterophenomenology)
- No new counterarguments identified

## Attribution Accuracy Check

- Rosenthal's three conditions: Verified ✓
- Armstrong/Lycan HOP: Correctly attributed ✓
- Lycan's retreat from HOP: Accurate ✓
- Block 2011 direct quote: Verified ✓
- Farrell 2018 on ambitious HOT: Correctly attributed ✓
- Brown 2025 HOROR: Referenced with publication ✓
- Maniscalco & Lau 2012: Correctly cited ✓
- Whiten 2015 Jourdain Hypothesis: Correctly cited ✓
- No qualifier-dropping, position-overstating, or source/Map conflation detected

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent empirical dissociation evidence with clean table
- Strong opening summary capturing access/phenomenal distinction
- Original metarepresentational three-level distinction analysis
- HOROR theory engagement with nuanced critique
- Illusionism connection showing HOT's logical extreme
- "Can HOT Be Tested?" section with three empirical challenges
- Mental causation implications integrated with Bidirectional Interaction tenet
- Self-reference paradox connection

### Enhancements Made
- Updated 4 stale `[[metarepresentation]]` wikilinks to `[[metacognition]]`
- Added `[[blindsight]]` wikilink in Blindsight Revisited section and concepts frontmatter
- Softened uncited tACS study claim

### Cross-links Updated
- `[[metarepresentation]]` → `[[metacognition]]` (archived content redirect)
- Added `[[blindsight]]` (discussed extensively but previously unlinked)

## Remaining Items

None. Article remains stable and well-integrated.

## Statistics

- **Word count change**: 2739 → 2740 (+1 word)
- **Critical issues addressed**: 0 (none found)
- **Medium issues addressed**: 2
- **Enhancements made**: 3 (wikilink updates + cross-link)

## Stability Notes

This article remains stable after its third deep review. Key philosophical disagreements from previous reviews persist as expected:

1. **Eliminativists/physicalists will find the dualist framing question-begging** — Bedrock disagreement with the Map's tenets, not a flaw.
2. **The quantum prediction remains speculative** — Appropriately hedged.
3. **Contemplative evidence has inherent limitations** — Acknowledged explicitly.
4. **Buddhist engagement is somewhat instrumental** — Deferred across two reviews; article is above soft threshold so expansion isn't appropriate. This is a low-priority item that could be addressed if the article is ever condensed.

Future reviews should NOT re-flag these. The article has converged to a stable, well-integrated state. The main maintenance concern going forward is keeping wikilinks current as the broader site evolves (as addressed in this review).
