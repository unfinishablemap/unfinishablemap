# Deep Review: The Measurement Problem

**Date**: 2026-01-25
**File**: obsidian/concepts/measurement-problem.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-26T00:30:00+00:00 (timestamp appears to be from future, likely timezone issue)
**Word count**: 2485 → 2491 (+6 words)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Unfalsifiability acknowledgment integration**: The "honest limitation" paragraph is excellent but sits alone at the top. However, the article already notes this is "a philosophical framework compatible with physics, not a competing scientific theory"—this framing is maintained throughout. *No change needed.*
- **MWI engagement on self-locating uncertainty**: The current treatment already engages substantively—noting Wallace's derivation succeeds on its own terms, identifying the presupposition of singular perspectives, and clearly stating the fundamental disagreement. *No change needed.*

### Medium Issues Found
- **Frauchiger-Renner vagueness**: The caveat about "contested premises" was vague. *Resolution: Specified that contested premises include whether observers can simultaneously hold knowledge claims and be in superposition.*

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminativist challenge**: The article engages with this through the functionalist/Dennett discussion, acknowledging the disagreement is "fundamental and unresolved."
- **Tegmark decoherence objection**: Explicitly addressed with clear acknowledgment of scientific consensus.
- **MWI self-locating uncertainty**: Engaged with directly; the article clearly states this is a fundamental disagreement about whether phenomenological singularity is the explanandum.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening summary front-loads the key claim with precision
- "Honest limitation" paragraph demonstrates philosophical sophistication
- Indexical dimension section makes a genuinely important connection to the hard problem
- Multi-observer coordination problem and interface-locality resolution are sophisticated
- Causal closure loophole argument is well-structured with clear numbered features
- Epistemic calibration throughout (acknowledges consensus, burden of proof, etc.)

### Enhancements Made
- **Added qualia cross-link**: Connected the indexical gap to "the [[qualia|qualitative character]] of experience" to strengthen the hard problem connection
- **Specified Frauchiger-Renner contested premise**: Clarified that the debate concerns whether observers can simultaneously hold knowledge claims and be in superposition

### Cross-links Added
- [[qualia]] (new link in indexical dimension section)

## Remaining Items

None. The article is at 99% of soft threshold (2491/2500 words), so further expansion is not advisable. The existing treatment of MWI and other interpretations is substantive and fair. The article maintains appropriate epistemic humility while clearly stating the Map's position.
