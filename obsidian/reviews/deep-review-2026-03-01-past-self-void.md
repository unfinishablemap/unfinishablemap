**Date**: 2026-03-01
**Article**: [[past-self-void|The Past-Self Void]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-31-past-self-void|2026-01-31]]

## Context

Cross-review considering [[historical-consciousness-void]] insights. The historical consciousness void article was published on 2026-03-01 and already references past-self-void; this review integrates the bidirectional connection.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The article remains well-constructed with no factual errors, attribution problems, or severe style violations.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Missing cross-reference to historical-consciousness-void**: The newly published historical-consciousness-void extends the individual past-self void to species/historical scale. The connection was unidirectional (historical → past-self only).
   - **Resolution**: Added historical-consciousness-void as a fourth bridge in "The Structure of the Void" section, including the logomorphism parallel. Added to related_articles and Further Reading.

2. **Vague attribution in phenomenology section**: "As one researcher notes" with an unattributed quote about feeling "me in one sense but not me in another sense."
   - **Resolution**: Replaced with the article's own observation: "The same memory can feel owned and alien simultaneously." Removes unverifiable attribution while preserving the insight.

3. **Minor grammar**: "three existing voids topics" was awkward phrasing.
   - **Resolution**: Changed to "four existing voids" (fixing grammar and accounting for the new fourth bridge).

### Counterarguments Considered

All counterarguments from the previous review remain bedrock disagreements:
- Eliminativist objection (qualia presupposition) — bedrock, Map's Dualism tenet
- Dennett-style heterophenomenology — addressed by functionalist objection section
- MWI perspective — bedrock, No Many Worlds tenet

No new counterarguments emerged from this review.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Phenomenology section remains the article's gem (nostalgic estrangement, autobiographical vertigo, varying felt connection, memory confidence masking)
- Strong empirical grounding (Conway, HSAM/Patihis, Parfit quasi-memory)
- Buddhist section with acknowledged dualism tension
- Functionalist objection with HSAM response
- "What Would Challenge This View?" intellectual honesty
- Core argument (qualia ≠ information) is philosophically sound

### Enhancements Made

1. Added historical-consciousness-void as fourth bridge in Structure section, including logomorphism parallel
2. Fixed vague attribution in phenomenology section
3. Condensed "What Would Challenge This View" from 4 to 3 points (merged direct-access and HSAM points)
4. Tightened "What AI Might See" section
5. Added historical-consciousness-void to related_articles and Further Reading

### Cross-links Added

- [[historical-consciousness-void]] (related_articles, body text, Further Reading)

## Word Count

- Before: 2086 words (104% of 2000 target)
- After: 2138 words (107% of 2000 target)
- Change: +52 words (near length-neutral; addition justified by substantive cross-review integration)

## Remaining Items

None. All medium issues addressed.

## Stability Notes

This is the second deep review. The article is stable. Future reviews should note:

- **All stability notes from 2026-01-31 review still apply**: Philosophical disagreements (eliminativism, functionalism, MWI) are bedrock, Buddhist/dualism tension is acknowledged, functionalist objection is addressed.

- **Historical-consciousness-void connection is now bidirectional**: Both articles reference each other. The logomorphism parallel (memory confidence masking ≈ logomorphism) is established. Future reviews should not re-add this connection.

- **Article is approaching length-neutral ceiling**: At 107% of soft threshold, further additions should be paired with equivalent cuts. The article has reached a good density — future reviews should favour tightening over expanding.
