**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. All factual claims verified (including Kent & Wittmann 2021 citation against the actual paper). No misattributions detected. No internal contradictions. Required sections present.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Oversimplified reversibility claim**: Original text said "physics equations run equally well backward" without acknowledging statistical mechanics and thermodynamic irreversibility. Bergson's claim of experiential irreversibility needed to be distinguished from both fundamental time-symmetry and thermodynamic irreversibility. **Resolution**: Qualified the claim to distinguish three kinds of irreversibility (fundamental physics, thermodynamic, experiential).

2. **MWI argument too quick**: Original claimed many-worlds "would shatter durée into fragments." But within each branch, duration remains continuous—the argument was attacking a strawman. **Resolution**: Rewritten to argue that branching undermines the ontological significance of temporal identity by multiplying incompatible histories, rather than destroying within-branch continuity.

3. **Contemplative corroboration lacked citations**: Original mentioned "meditation traditions" without specifics. **Resolution**: Added specific examples (Theravada vipassana arising-passing, jhāna temporal suspension) and cross-links to existing Map articles on contemplative evidence and contemplative reliability.

4. **No engagement with unfalsifiability objection to intuition**: Bergson's claim that analysis cannot capture duration invites the obvious question: how do we verify intuition does? **Resolution**: Added a paragraph addressing this, noting Bergson's view of intuition as disciplined attention rather than mystical revelation, with cross-link to contemplative epistemology.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Eliminative materialist**: Duration's qualitative features may be what neural temporal integration processes "feel like." Expected philosophical disagreement—not a flaw in the article.
- **Dennett-style physicalist**: Bergson assumes first-person authority via "intuition." Addressed by adding the unfalsifiability engagement paragraph.
- **MWI defender**: Each branch maintains its own continuous duration. Addressed by rewriting the No Many Worlds argument.
- **Empiricist**: Contemplative claims need evidence. Addressed by adding specific examples and cross-links.
- **Buddhist philosopher**: Momentariness (kṣaṇikavāda) may contradict continuous flow. The article already mentions vipassana's arising-passing, which implicitly acknowledges this tension. Not addressed further—this is a genuinely open question that could merit its own article.

### Attribution Accuracy Check

- **Misattribution check**: PASS. All claims about Bergson's philosophy are standard interpretations attributed to specific works.
- **Qualifier preservation**: PASS. No dropped qualifiers detected.
- **Position strength**: PASS. Uses appropriate verbs ("argued," "developed," "connected").
- **Source/Map separation**: PASS. Relation to Site Perspective section clearly separates Bergson's claims from Map interpretation. One inline mention of filter theory is appropriately marked with "aligns with."
- **Self-contradiction check**: PASS. No contradictions detected.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Excellent opening paragraph that clearly states thesis and why Bergson matters for dualism
- Clean four-feature characterization of durée (heterogeneity, interpenetration, indivisibility, irreversibility)
- The melody analogy—highly effective for making interpenetration intuitive
- Honest treatment of élan vital: acknowledges criticism without dismissal, identifies what survives
- Well-balanced Bergson-Whitehead comparison noting both parallels and genuine divergences
- Good source/Map separation throughout
- Strong Further Reading section connecting to 9 related Map articles

### Enhancements Made

- Qualified irreversibility claim to distinguish experiential from thermodynamic irreversibility
- Added engagement with the epistemological challenge to Bergson's intuition method
- Strengthened MWI argument with more precise formulation about ontological significance
- Added specific contemplative examples and cross-links
- Added contemplative-epistemology and contemplative-reliability to frontmatter concepts

### Cross-links Added

- [[contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness-theories]]
- [[contemplative-reliability]]
- [[contemplative-epistemology]]

## Remaining Items

None. All medium issues addressed. The article is in good shape.

## Stability Notes

- **Eliminative materialist disagreement**: Materialists will always argue that durée is "just" neural temporal processing. This is a bedrock philosophical disagreement, not a fixable flaw.
- **Buddhist momentariness tension**: Whether experience is continuous flow (Bergson) or discrete momentary arisings (Buddhist) is a genuine open question. Future articles could explore this; it should not be flagged as a flaw in *this* article.
- **Élan vital**: The article's honest acknowledgment of criticism around the élan vital is the right approach. Future reviews should not push to either rehabilitate or further criticize it.
