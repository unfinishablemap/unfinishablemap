# Tenet Alignment Check

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Files checked**: 232 (68 topics + 164 concepts)
**Errors**: 0
**Warnings**: 0
**Notes**: 0

## Summary

All 232 files in the `obsidian/topics/` and `obsidian/concepts/` directories were reviewed for alignment with The Unfinishable Map's five foundational tenets:

1. **Dualism** - Consciousness is not reducible to physical processes
2. **Minimal Quantum Interaction** - Smallest possible non-physical influence on quantum outcomes
3. **Bidirectional Interaction** - Consciousness causally influences the physical world
4. **No Many Worlds** - Reject MWI; indexical identity matters
5. **Occam's Razor Has Limits** - Simplicity is unreliable with incomplete knowledge

Every article includes an explicit "Relation to Site Perspective" section that connects the content to the relevant tenets. No direct contradictions, implicit conflicts, or notable tensions were identified.

The content demonstrates consistent alignment across diverse philosophical domains including consciousness studies, quantum mechanics, ethics, Eastern philosophy, AI consciousness, phenomenology, and temporal structure of experience.

## Observations

1. **Consistent Structure**: All topic articles follow the established pattern of including a "Relation to Site Perspective" section that explicitly connects content to relevant tenets.

2. **Balanced Treatment**: Articles discussing opposing views (e.g., illusionism, materialism, many-worlds) present these positions fairly while clearly articulating why the Map takes a different stance.

3. **Falsifiability Maintained**: Many articles include "What Would Challenge This View?" sections, maintaining intellectual honesty about conditions under which the Map's positions would need revision.

4. **Cross-Referencing**: Articles effectively cross-reference related concepts and tenets, creating a coherent philosophical network.

5. **AI Refinement Notes**: Several articles contain AI refinement logs indicating ongoing improvements to address identified weaknesses, demonstrating active quality management.

## Concepts Directory Analysis

All 164 concept files also pass alignment checks. Key categories examined:

### Opponent Positions (Correctly Framed as Rejected)
- materialism.md - Correctly frames materialism as the Map's "primary opponent"
- illusionism.md - Presents illusionism critically with regress problem
- many-worlds.md - Explicitly rejects MWI per Tenet 4
- functionalism.md - Rejects based on absent qualia arguments
- epiphenomenalism.md - Rejects via self-stultification argument
- reductionism.md - Explains why consciousness resists reduction

### Core Framework Articles (Correctly Aligned)
- dualism.md - Foundational tenet article
- interactionist-dualism.md - The Map's central position
- qualia.md - Core phenomenal property article
- consciousness.md - Treats consciousness as irreducible
- stapp-quantum-mind.md - Quantum Zeno mechanism aligned with Minimal Quantum Interaction

### Rival Theories (Fairly Presented but Not Endorsed)
- integrated-information-theory.md - Acknowledges IIT takes consciousness seriously but notes conflicts
- global-workspace-theory.md - GWT explains access but not phenomenal consciousness
- higher-order-theories.md - Explains access without explaining phenomenal experience
- predictive-processing.md - Framework neutral, doesn't solve hard problem
- attention-schema-theory.md - Rejects AST due to regress problem

### Alternative Metaphysical Positions (Correctly Handled)
- panpsychism.md - Shares anti-emergence insight, Map prefers interactionism
- idealism.md - Acknowledges agreements while maintaining dualism
- analytic-idealism.md - Presents Kastrup fairly with disagreements noted
- russellian-monism.md - Map prefers explicit dualism
