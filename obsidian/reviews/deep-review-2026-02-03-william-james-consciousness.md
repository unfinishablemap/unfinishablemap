**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Article**: [[william-james-consciousness|William James and Consciousness]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-02-william-james-consciousness|2026-02-02]]
**Focus**: Orphan integration (no inbound links)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article was reviewed yesterday and found to have no critical issues. This review confirms stability.

### Medium Issues Found
None new. Previous review already addressed:
- Stapp connection framing (now "one possible interpretation")
- Causal engagement claim (appropriately hedged)

### Counterarguments Considered
All six adversarial personas were applied:
- **Eliminative Materialist**: Introspective limits acknowledged in "What James Got Wrong"
- **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: Filter theory framed appropriately as alternative interpretation
- **Quantum Skeptic**: Zeno connection framed as speculative
- **Many-Worlds Defender**: Site rejects MWI (bedrock disagreement)
- **Empiricist**: Pragmatism section appropriate
- **Buddhist Philosopher**: Pure experience reported fairly as James's position

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening summary effectively positions James's relevance to Map's tenets
- Quote selections excellent and well-integrated
- "What James Got Wrong" section demonstrates intellectual honesty
- Fringe and substantive/transitive explanations particularly clear
- Relation to Site Perspective methodically covers all five tenets

### Enhancements Made
- Added cross-link to [[specious-present]] (concept James helped develop)
- Added cross-link to [[attention]] concept page

### Cross-links Added to Target
- [[specious-present]]
- [[attention]]

### Inbound Links Added (Orphan Integration)
Six articles now link to william-james-consciousness.md:
- [[filter-theory]] — Opening paragraph
- [[specious-present]] — Concept development attribution
- [[mental-effort]] — Phenomenology of effort section
- [[temporal-consciousness]] — Opening paragraph
- [[attention]] — Phenomenology of effort section
- [[process-philosophy]] — Combination problem section

## Remaining Items

None. The article has reached stability and is now integrated into site navigation.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed twice in consecutive days and found to have no critical issues. The philosophical disagreements identified (MWI rejection, introspective reliability concerns) are acknowledged as bedrock disagreements in the previous review. The article is stable.

Future reviews should NOT re-flag:
- MWI critique (site commitment)
- Introspective reliability concerns (acknowledged in article)
- Stapp connection strength (already appropriately hedged)

The primary achievement of this review was orphan integration: the article now has six inbound links from related articles where "William James" was mentioned but not linked.
