# Deep Review: The Combination Problem

**Date**: 2026-01-28
**File**: obsidian/concepts/combination-problem.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-19

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None identified. The article is well-structured with no factual errors, internal contradictions, or missing required sections.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Empirical distinguishability section overstated asymmetry**: The section presented interactionism as empirically testable while panpsychism is not, but didn't acknowledge that interactionist predictions are also unconfirmed.
   - *Resolution*: Added acknowledgment that interactionist predictions "remain unconfirmed" and that "Neither framework has decisive empirical support, but interactionism at least identifies what evidence would count."

### Low Issues Found

- Quantum mechanism details are underspecified—but this is appropriate for the article's scope as a treatment of the combination problem, not a defense of quantum interaction theories.
- Criteria for "solving" the combination problem are implicit rather than explicit—but the article uses appropriately hedged language ("may be unsolvable").

### Counterarguments Considered

All six adversarial personas were applied:

1. **Eliminative Materialist**: Argued micro-experiences may be incoherent folk psychology. *Status*: Philosophical disagreement; article frames itself for readers taking panpsychism seriously.

2. **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: Questioned the empirical testability claims. *Status*: Medium issue addressed above.

3. **Quantum Skeptic**: Raised decoherence objections. *Status*: Appropriate to defer to linked articles on quantum consciousness.

4. **Many-Worlds Defender**: Noted MWI changes combination dynamics. *Status*: Bedrock disagreement addressed elsewhere on site.

5. **Empiricist**: Questioned asymmetric treatment of tractability. *Status*: Low issue; hedged language is appropriate.

6. **Buddhist Philosopher**: Previous review already added process philosophy and Buddhist no-self engagement.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Chalmers' four-dimensional taxonomy (subject-summing, palette, grain, structure) is clearly presented
- James's "shut in their own skin" phenomenological observation grounds abstract metaphysics
- Comparison table effectively contrasts panpsychism and interactionism challenges
- "What Panpsychism Gets Right" section shows intellectual honesty
- Process philosophy/Buddhist perspective engagement (from previous review)
- Empirical distinguishability section with concrete research directions (from previous review)
- Strong tenet connections in Relation to Site Perspective

### Enhancements Made

1. Balanced the empirical distinguishability section to acknowledge unconfirmed predictions
2. Added `[[free-will]]` cross-link—the article discusses mental causation ("consciousness selects among outcomes"), which is directly relevant to free will debates

### Cross-links Added

- [[free-will]] — Mental causation implications of the interaction alternative

## Remaining Items

None. The article has reached a stable state after this second deep review. Minor issues from pessimistic analysis are matters of emphasis rather than errors.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been deep-reviewed twice (2026-01-19, 2026-01-28). The philosophical positions it takes—that interactionism avoids the combination problem while panpsychism does not—represent the Map's perspective. The following are bedrock disagreements, not fixable problems:

- **MWI proponents** will always find the rejection of many-worlds unsatisfying
- **Panpsychists** will dispute that the combination problem is harder than the interaction problem
- **Eliminativists** will reject the framing that takes micro-experiences seriously

Future reviews should not re-flag these as issues. The article accurately presents the Map's position and engages fairly with alternatives.
