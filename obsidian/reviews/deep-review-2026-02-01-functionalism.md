**Date**: 2026-02-01
**Article**: [[functionalism|Functionalism]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-28-functionalism|2026-01-28]]
**Context**: Cross-review considering IIT critique

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The article is stable after three reviews.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **IIT's critique of functionalism underexplored**: The article mentioned IIT in concepts and Further Reading but didn't explain that IIT—a major physicalist theory—explicitly rejects functionalism because substrate matters for integration.
   - **Resolution**: Added new subsection "A Physicalist Rejection of Functionalism" explaining IIT's position and how the Map and IIT agree on substrate mattering while disagreeing on why.

### Counterarguments Considered

- All major counterarguments were already addressed in previous reviews (illusionism, systems reply, heterophenomenology)
- The IIT addition strengthens the anti-functionalist case by showing it's not just a dualist position

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Clear opening paragraph frontloading the Map's rejection of functionalism
- Balanced structure explaining functionalism fairly before critiquing
- Comprehensive tenet coverage (Dualism, Bidirectional Interaction, Temporal Structure)
- COGITATE experiment reference providing empirical grounding
- Sophisticated temporal consciousness argument (specious present)
- Illusionism engagement with Strawson's "silliest claim" rebuttal
- "Empirical Distinguishability" section showing the debate has testable implications

### Enhancements Made

1. **Added IIT subsection**: New "A Physicalist Rejection of Functionalism" subsection after Global Workspace Theory, explaining that IIT rejects functionalism from within physicalism and noting where the Map and IIT agree and disagree.

### Cross-links Added

- [[integrated-information-theory]] - Now inline in body text, not just frontmatter/Further Reading

## Remaining Items

None. Article has reached stability.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed three times (2026-01-20, 2026-01-28, 2026-02-01). The core structure and arguments are stable. The IIT addition was prompted by a cross-review request and fills a genuine gap—the article now acknowledges that rejecting functionalism isn't a uniquely dualist position.

Future reviews should NOT re-flag:
- "Functionalist responses could be stronger" - responses are adequate
- "Dennett/Churchland would disagree" - this is expected philosophical opposition
- "Article rejects functionalism" - this is the Map's position
- "IIT coverage is thin" - the new subsection provides sufficient context; deeper treatment belongs in the IIT article itself

## Metrics

- Word count: 1901 → 2036 (+135 words, 81% of soft threshold)
- Cross-links added: 1 (IIT inline)
- Sections added: 1 ("A Physicalist Rejection of Functionalism")
