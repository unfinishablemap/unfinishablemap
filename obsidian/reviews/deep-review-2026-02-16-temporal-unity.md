**Date**: 2026-02-16
**Article**: [[temporal-unity|Temporal Unity]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The article is factually sound, internally consistent, and meets all structural requirements. The Map's classification of C.D. Broad as a retentionalist is consistent across all site content.

### Medium Issues Found

- **Specious present range inconsistent with canonical source**: Article stated "100 to 750 milliseconds" while the canonical temporal-consciousness article uses "100 milliseconds to 3 seconds." Resolution: Added qualifier noting both the core perceptual window and broader estimates, with cross-reference to temporal-consciousness for the full range.

- **No engagement with the illusionist challenge**: The Map's illusionism article has extensive treatment of why temporal flow cannot be dismissed as constructed narrative. Resolution: Added a paragraph after the disruptions section acknowledging the illusionist challenge and citing the regress argument.

- **MWI argument contained a conceptual weakness**: The original claim that retention "would inherit from all branches simultaneously" is vulnerable to the standard MWI reply that each branch-observer inherits determinate content from that branch only. Resolution: Rewrote the No Many Worlds paragraph to engage with the actual MWI position and make the stronger argument—that decoherence-only temporal structure renders consciousness causally idle.

- **Schizophrenia claim lacked citation**: Added Fuchs (2007) and Vogeley & Kupke (2007) as references for temporal disintegration in schizophrenia.

- **Links to archived articles**: `[[specious-present]]` and `[[duration]]` pointed to coalesced/archived content. Resolution: Updated inline links to point to `[[temporal-consciousness]]` and updated frontmatter concept links.

### Low Issues Found

- **"Confirm" overstated**: Changed "These dissociations confirm" to "These dissociations support the view" — appropriate confidence calibration per writing style guide.

- **Explanatory gap introduced without inline context**: Added brief gloss "the gulf between physical and phenomenal description" for LLM self-containment.

- **"Duration-block" undefined**: Added brief inline definition: "a temporally extended unit of experience whose boundaries are set by collapse rather than by computational convenience."

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Illusionist challenge to temporal flow** (Dennett, Frankish): Addressed with a new paragraph citing the Map's regress argument—the illusion of flow would itself need to be temporally unified, regenerating the explanatory demand.

- **Branch-relative determinacy in MWI**: Addressed by rewriting the No Many Worlds paragraph to target the deeper issue: decoherence-only explanations leave consciousness with no constitutive role in temporal structure.

- **Neural correlation as evidence for reduction**: The disruption evidence (schizophrenia, dreamless sleep) is acknowledged as compatible with both dualist and physicalist readings; the article focuses on what the disruptions reveal about temporal unity's distinctness as a phenomenal property.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- **Opening paragraph's conceptual precision**: The three-way distinction from synchronic unity, subject unity, and the "what makes experience flow?" question. Left unchanged.

- **The "experienced succession" distinction and melody example**: Phenomenologically apt and concrete. Left unchanged.

- **Retention as "fading presence"**: The three-way distinction between perception, retention, and memory. Left unchanged.

- **The temporal explanatory gap formulation**: "No description of state A followed by state B captures what it is like to experience A flowing into B." Left unchanged.

- **The collapse-boundary metaphor**: "What it is like to be at the boundary where superposition resolves into fact." Left unchanged.

- **The disruptions section's three-case spectrum**: Total absence (sleep), pathological degradation (schizophrenia), functional alteration (flow). Structure preserved, content enhanced.

### Enhancements Made

- Added illusionist challenge engagement with regress argument response
- Strengthened MWI argument to engage with actual Everettian position
- Clarified specious present range with qualifier and cross-reference
- Glossed "duration-block" and "explanatory gap" for self-containment
- Added citation for schizophrenia claim
- Added cross-link to [[phenomenology-of-choice]] in Bidirectional Interaction paragraph

### Cross-links Added

- [[temporal-consciousness]] — replaced archived [[specious-present]] link
- [[consciousness-and-temporal-asymmetry]] — felt asymmetry between past and future
- [[stapp-quantum-mind]] — quantum Zeno mechanism for consciousness-brain interaction
- [[phenomenology-of-choice]] — deliberation presupposes temporal unity
- [[illusionism]] — the illusionist challenge and regress argument

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues were addressed in this session.

## Stability Notes

- The six adversarial personas produced expected philosophical disagreements that are not article flaws: the eliminative materialist's insistence that neural mechanisms suffice, the Buddhist challenge to subject persistence, and the Dennettian Multiple Drafts alternative are bedrock disagreements that the Map's framework is designed to engage, not eliminate.
- The classification of C.D. Broad as a retentionalist is consistent across all Map content. While there is scholarly debate about Broad's exact position, the Map has adopted a consistent classification that should not be changed without updating all related articles simultaneously.
- Future reviews should not re-flag the MWI argument unless new content has been added; the current formulation engages with the actual Everettian position rather than a caricature.
