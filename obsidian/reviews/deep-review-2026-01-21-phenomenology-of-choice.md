# Deep Review: Phenomenology of Choice

**Date**: 2026-01-21
**File**: obsidian/concepts/phenomenology-of-choice.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article is well-constructed with strong arguments and clear structure.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Illusionist engagement incomplete**: The regress objection mentioned Tallis but didn't engage with Frankish's quasi-phenomenal properties response.
   - **Resolution**: Added new "Frankish's Quasi-Phenomenal Response" subsection (~150 words) explaining the quasi-phenomenal strategy and why it faces the same regress. Added zombie reformulation argument and connection to luck objection.

2. **Contemplative evidence generic**: The article mentioned "advanced meditators" without citing specific Buddhist or Hindu sources.
   - **Resolution**: Added ~200 words on specific traditions: Abhidhamma on cetanā, Nyanaponika Thera on bare attention, Tibetan dzogchen on recognition vs captivation, Patañjali's viveka-khyāti, and Advaita Vedānta's sākṣin (witness-self).

3. **Decoherence not addressed**: The quantum Zeno mechanism was mentioned without engaging the timescale objection.
   - **Resolution**: Added brief engagement with decoherence objection and cross-links to decoherence.md and quantum-coherence-protection.md.

4. **Many-Worlds response thin**: The No Many Worlds section asserted the phenomenology would be "illusory" without addressing the MWI response that phenomenology is real in each branch.
   - **Resolution**: Expanded to address the "real in each branch" objection (~100 words), explaining why this relocates rather than dissolves the puzzle and why the indexical question remains unanswerable.

### Low Issues Found
1. **Missing cross-link to temporal-consciousness.md**: The Bergson/duration section discussed temporal experience without linking to the dedicated article.
   - **Resolution**: Added cross-link in the duration section.

### Counterarguments Considered
- Eliminative materialist: Effort phenomenology could be explained by neural resource allocation tracking
- Heterophenomenological: We should study reports without assuming accuracy
- Many-worlds: Phenomenology is real in each branch

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening summary: Direct, philosophically weighted, survives truncation
- Table comparing observation vs choice: Clear, useful structure
- Three-level agency structure (selecting, refraining, meta-choosing): Original insight
- Process philosophy integration: Well-connected to Whitehead
- Falsifiability conditions: Clear, specific, intellectually honest
- Bergson/duration analysis: Sophisticated and original

### Enhancements Made
1. Expanded illusionist challenge with Frankish's quasi-phenomenal properties and zombie reformulation
2. Added specific Buddhist and Hindu sources for contemplative evidence
3. Added decoherence engagement with cross-links to protection mechanisms
4. Strengthened No Many Worlds argument against "real in each branch" objection
5. Added temporal-consciousness cross-link

### Cross-links Added
- [[luck-objection]] - in illusionist challenge section
- [[quantum-coherence-protection]] - in quantum mechanism section
- [[temporal-consciousness]] - in Bergson/duration section

## Remaining Items

None. All medium-priority issues addressed.

## Summary

The phenomenology-of-choice.md article was already well-constructed. This review strengthened four areas:
1. Deeper engagement with Frankish's illusionist response
2. Specific contemplative tradition citations
3. Decoherence acknowledgment with appropriate cross-links
4. Stronger No Many Worlds argument

Total additions: ~500 words across 4 sections.
