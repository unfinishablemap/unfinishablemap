**Date**: 2026-02-22
**Article**: [[materialism|Materialism]]
**Previous review**: Never (note: deep-review-2026-01-20-arguments-against-materialism was for a different article)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Duplicate frontmatter entry**: `[[the-case-for-dualism]]` appeared twice in `concepts` list. **Resolution**: Removed duplicate.
- **Duplicate Further Reading entry**: `[[the-case-for-dualism]]` appeared twice in Further Reading with different descriptions. **Resolution**: Consolidated into single entry.

### Medium Issues Found
- **PhilPapers survey claim inaccuracy**: Article stated "22% of philosophers accept or lean toward dualism" citing the 2020 survey. The 22% figure is actually for "accept non-physicalism" (broader than dualism; includes panpsychism, idealism, etc.), and "accept or lean" totals ~32%. **Resolution**: Corrected to "approximately 32% of philosophers accept or lean toward non-physicalism—the main alternative to materialism."
- **No inbound links (orphaned)**: Core concept page had zero inbound wikilinks from other articles. **Resolution**: Added `[[concepts/materialism]]` links to explanatory-gap.md, functionalism.md, and emergence.md (both inline and frontmatter). Idealism.md already had the link.

### Counterarguments Considered
- Eliminative materialist: treatment fair but could more precisely engage strongest version (Churchland's replacement vs. denial framing). Adequate for concept page that links to [[illusionism]].
- Dennett's heterophenomenology: illusionism section thin but appropriate given link to dedicated page.
- MWI dissolution: claim about indexical problem asserted rather than argued; low priority.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear opening summary staking the claim immediately
- Well-organized taxonomy of materialist positions with effective "problem:" format under each variety
- Causal closure argument with precisely targeted response via quantum indeterminacy
- "What Would Challenge This View?" section with five falsification conditions
- Comprehensive further reading and references sections
- Strong tenet connection section covering all five tenets

### Enhancements Made
- Fixed duplicate frontmatter and Further Reading entries
- Corrected PhilPapers survey claim for accuracy
- Added 3 inbound cross-references from related concept pages

### Cross-links Added (from other articles TO materialism)
- [[explanatory-gap]] — added `[[concepts/materialism|physicalist]]` inline link and frontmatter entry
- [[functionalism]] — added `[[concepts/materialism|physicalism]]` inline link and frontmatter entry
- [[emergence]] — added `[[concepts/materialism|physicalism]]` inline link (frontmatter already present)

### Cross-links Already Present (no action needed)
- [[idealism]] — already has `[[concepts/materialism]]` inline (line 62) and frontmatter
- [[philosophical-zombies]] — already has `[[concepts/materialism|physicalism]]` inline
- [[illusionism]] — already has `[[concepts/materialism]]` inline
- [[knowledge-argument]] — already has `[[concepts/materialism|physicalism]]` inline
- [[phenomenal-consciousness]] — already has `[[concepts/materialism]]` inline
- [[hard-problem-of-consciousness]] — already has `[[concepts/materialism|Materialism]]` inline

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues addressed.

## Stability Notes

- The six adversarial personas are designed to disagree with dualist content. Their objections to this article represent expected philosophical standoffs, not fixable flaws. The eliminativist's complaint that "qualitative character is assumed real" and the Buddhist philosopher's concern about "substantial self" are bedrock disagreements inherent to the Map's tenet framework.
- The article's treatment of individual materialist positions (reductive, non-reductive, eliminative, illusionist) is appropriately concise for a concept page that links to dedicated treatment pages. Future reviews should not flag "thin sections" when dedicated pages exist.
- Word count: 2220 → 2204 (88% of 2500 soft threshold). Comfortable room remains.
