**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Missing falsifiability conditions**: Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section with five testable conditions (complete neural determinism, elimination of neural quantum effects, successful illusionist explanation, dissociation of reports from experiences, MWI confirmation)
- **No engagement with decoherence objection**: Added "The Decoherence Challenge" subsection explaining Tegmark's objection and why decoherence doesn't eliminate quantum indeterminacy

### Medium Issues Found
- **No illusionist engagement**: Added subsection "The Illusionist Response" with the self-stultification counter-argument (misrepresentation presupposes presentation)
- **No Many-Worlds connection**: Added "Why Not Many Worlds?" subsection explaining why The Unfinishable Map's rejection of MWI is essential for mental causation
- **Missing process philosophy perspective**: Added subsection on Whitehead's "actual occasions" as alternative framing where all causation is experiential

### Counterarguments Considered
- Eliminative materialist: Neural information processing might produce accurate reports without phenomenal causation
- Illusionist: The appearance of consciousness is cognitive error, not phenomenal illusion
- Quantum skeptic: Decoherence destroys quantum effects before consciousness can exploit them
- Many-worlds defender: All outcomes occur, so no selection for consciousness to perform

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Self-stultification argument: Clear and epistemically powerful
- Kim's exclusion argument presentation: Fair and well-structured
- Quantum opening explanation: Accessible without being simplistic
- Agent causation section: Good phenomenological grounding
- Site perspective section: Strong tenet connections

### Enhancements Made
- Added "The Decoherence Challenge" subsection addressing the physics objection with recent research context
- Added "Why Not Many Worlds?" subsection making the MWI rejection explicit
- Added "Process Philosophy Alternative" subsection presenting Whitehead's view
- Added "The Interface Question" subsection connecting to pairing problem and interface-locality
- Added "The Illusionist Response" subsection with counter-argument
- Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section with five falsifiability conditions
- Expanded References section with Frankish, Tallis, Tegmark, and Whitehead

### Cross-links Added

- [[pairing-problem]]
- [[decoherence]]
- [[attention-as-interface]]
