**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Article**: [[volitional-opacity|Volitional Opacity]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-07-volitional-opacity|2026-02-07]]

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **William James misquote**: "The rush of thought..." was missing "the" and omitted "is so headlong that it." Corrected to match the actual text from *The Principles of Psychology*, Chapter 9: "The rush of the thought is so headlong that it almost always brings us up at the conclusion before we can arrest it." Resolution: corrected the quotation.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing Kriegel reference**: The article quotes Uriah Kriegel ("mobilizing force in the face of resistance") but had no citation in the References section. Resolution: added Kriegel, U. (2015). *The Varieties of Consciousness*. Oxford University Press.
- **Soon et al. timing conservative**: The article says "up to seven seconds" but the authors' own claim is "up to 10 seconds" after correcting for hemodynamic lag. The seven-second figure is the raw fMRI signal lead and is defensible. Deferred: not a misrepresentation, and changing it would require explaining hemodynamic correction, adding length to an already over-threshold article.
- **Engineering limitation counterargument unaddressed** (carried from previous review): A physicalist might attribute opacity to ordinary neural architecture rather than ontological gaps. Deferred: would require ~50 words addition with equivalent cuts; marginal benefit given article stability.
- **Meditation convergence claim uncited** (carried from previous review): "Meditators across traditions report the same finding" lacks a specific citation. Deferred: the claim is widely supported in contemplative literature but no single canonical source was identified.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminativist**: Handled by Illusion Interpretation + Map's response about evolution of the illusion. Bedrock disagreement.
- **Physicalist/engineering limitation**: Valid but deferred — article is near length ceiling and the Merleau-Ponty fourth interpretation partially addresses distributed processing.
- **MWI defender**: Handled by No Many Worlds section. Bedrock disagreement.
- **Empiricist**: "What Would Challenge This View" section provides four specific conditions. Strong.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening thesis: "We know *that* we decide; we cannot observe *how* we decide"
- Three-dimensional taxonomy (temporal, process, mechanistic)
- Epistemic caveat in phenomenology section ("these phenomenological reports may themselves be constructed")
- Wegner nuance ("did not claim conscious thought cannot cause action")
- "What Would Challenge This View" — four specific falsifiable conditions
- All five tenet connections (substantive, each making a distinct argument)
- Akratic revelation as evidence of non-unity of the willing self
- Merleau-Ponty as fourth interpretation with dualism compatibility question
- Libet's explicitly dualistic view of the veto process

### Enhancements Made
- Corrected William James quote to match original text
- Added missing Kriegel reference

### Cross-links Added
- None (existing cross-link coverage is comprehensive)

## Remaining Items

- **Soon et al. timing**: Could note "up to 10 seconds" after hemodynamic correction, but current "seven seconds" is defensible and changing it adds complexity.
- **Engineering limitation response**: The strongest unaddressed counterargument. A brief note in the Closure Interpretation or Merleau-Ponty section could acknowledge that opacity might be explainable as neural architecture rather than ontological boundary, then note the Map's response that the *persistence* across all methods of inquiry suggests something deeper.
- **Meditation citation**: Uncited but widely reported. Low priority.

## Stability Notes

- This article has now been reviewed twice on the same day (2026-02-07). The first review addressed three critical issues (misattribution, unattributed quotes, missing qualifier) and several medium issues (added No Many Worlds section, reframed Merleau-Ponty, etc.). This second review found only one critical issue (James misquote) and two medium fixes.
- **The article is approaching stability.** The diminishing severity of findings across reviews (3 critical → 1 critical, with the one being a minor quotation accuracy issue) indicates convergence.
- The three remaining deferred items (engineering limitation, Soon et al. timing, meditation citation) are all low-impact and should NOT be treated as critical in future reviews. They represent minor refinement opportunities, not gaps.
- Bedrock philosophical disagreements (eliminativism, MWI, physicalism) remain as expected and should not be re-flagged.
- The Merleau-Ponty reframing as "fourth interpretation" should be considered settled.
- **Recommendation**: This article does not need further deep review unless its content is substantively modified. Future reviews should focus on other documents.
