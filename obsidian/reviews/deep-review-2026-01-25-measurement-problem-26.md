# Deep Review: The Measurement Problem

**Date**: 2026-01-25
**File**: obsidian/concepts/measurement-problem.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-25T17:50:18+00:00 (26th review)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Functionalist response dismissed too quickly**
   - Issue: The original text claimed Dennett "begs the question" but didn't engage with his actual epistemic point
   - Resolution: Rewrote to engage directly with the epistemic-access criterion and offered "proves too much" counterargument (solipsism parallel)

2. **Tegmark decoherence objection understated**
   - Issue: "Far shorter than neural timescales" obscured the 10^10 factor
   - Resolution: Changed to "ten billion times shorter" with explicit characterization as "devastating"

3. **Wallace's Born probability derivation not engaged**
   - Issue: Article dismissed decision-theoretic derivation as "insufficient" without explaining why
   - Resolution: Added explicit engagement with the derivation (rational agents must weight by Born probabilities to avoid Dutch books) while clarifying the Map's counter: this shows *how* to bet, not *what* probabilities mean when all outcomes occur

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Self-locating uncertainty slightly mischaracterized**
   - Issue: Article implied MWI defenders claim uncertainty about which branch is "real"
   - Resolution: Clarified this is pre-measurement uncertainty about which successor you'll become

2. **Stapp's "observation events" response insufficiently scrutinized**
   - Issue: Presented as legitimate counter without noting its circularity
   - Resolution: Tightened prose to highlight that Stapp hasn't specified what "observation events" physically are

### Counterarguments Considered

1. **"Why am I me?" as pseudo-question**: Addressed by noting that the functionalist criterion proves too much—would exclude other minds as well
2. **Empirical indistinguishability from random collapse**: Already addressed in honest limitation paragraph; this review preserved that acknowledgment
3. **10^10 decoherence factor**: Now explicitly stated with "devastating" characterization

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- The honest limitation paragraph—exemplary acknowledgment of unfalsifiability
- Bell's opening quotation framing the problem
- The parallel between measurement problem and hard problem (third-person/first-person gaps)
- The causal closure loophole section with its three features
- The "what would challenge this view" section
- The haecceity-indexical connection

### Enhancements Made

1. Strengthened functionalist exchange with "proves too much" argument
2. Added explicit engagement with Wallace's decision-theoretic derivation
3. Clarified the dilemma MWI faces regarding phenomenological singularity
4. Made decoherence objection quantitatively explicit

### Cross-links Maintained

All existing cross-links preserved:
- [[arguments-for-dualism]]
- [[mysterianism-cognitive-closure]]
- [[haecceity]]
- [[interface-locality]]
- [[prebiotic-collapse]]

## Word Count

- Before: 2504 words (100% of soft threshold)
- After: 2445 words (98% of soft threshold)
- Change: -59 words

Operated in length-neutral mode, tightening prose while improving engagement with objections.

## Remaining Items

None. All critical issues addressed in this review.
