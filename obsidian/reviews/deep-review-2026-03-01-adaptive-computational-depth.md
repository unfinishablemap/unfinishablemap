**Date**: 2026-03-01
**Article**: [[adaptive-computational-depth|Adaptive Computational Depth]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-25-adaptive-computational-depth|2026-02-25]] (extended integration, added 6 inbound links + 1 outbound)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article remains stable after three previous reviews. All six adversarial personas engaged with the content and found no new issues beyond documented bedrock disagreements.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Minor typo**: "Godel's" should be "Gödel's" (line 63) — inconsistent with site-wide usage. **Resolved**: Fixed.
- **Missing outbound cross-links**: The Non-Computability Turn section discussed Gödel/Turing limits without linking to [[computational-cognitive-limits]], which covers exactly these formal results. **Resolved**: Added inline link and Further Reading entry.
- **Missing Further Reading entry**: [[consciousness-and-mathematical-cognition]] has strong thematic overlap via Penrose's non-computability argument. **Resolved**: Added to Further Reading.

### Counterarguments Considered
No new counterarguments beyond those already documented. The self-allocation objection, MWI incompatibility, unfalsifiability, and computability of "what matters" are all handled in the text and documented as bedrock disagreements in previous reviews.

### Attribution Accuracy Check
All 6 source attributions re-verified — no changes since previous review:
- Wheeler (1990): Direct quote verified ✓
- Bostrom (2003): Accurate paraphrase, premise rejection noted ✓
- Wolfram (2002): Accurate, Map inference clearly labeled ✓
- Irwin et al. (2020): Correctly attributed, framework distinguished ✓
- Penrose (1994): Accurately cited ✓
- Faizal et al. (2025): Appropriately hedged ✓

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening summary effectively front-loads the non-computability insight
- Source progression (Wheeler → Bostrom → Wolfram → Irwin → Penrose → Faizal) builds cumulatively
- Honest epistemological status section acknowledging unfalsifiability
- Comprehensive five-tenet coverage with specific connections
- Five concrete falsifiers in "What Would Challenge This View?"
- Clean, verified attributions throughout

### Enhancements Made
Primary focus: **extended orphan integration** with 6 new inbound links from major concept/topic articles, plus 2 new outbound links and 1 typo fix.

### Cross-links Added

**New outbound links from adaptive-computational-depth (2):**
1. **[[computational-cognitive-limits]]** — Added inline in Non-Computability Turn section (Gödel/Turing/Chaitin limits) and in Further Reading
2. **[[consciousness-and-mathematical-cognition]]** — Added to Further Reading (Penrose non-computability connection)

**New inbound links (6 articles → adaptive-computational-depth):**
1. **[[measurement-problem]]** — In Consciousness-Based Interpretations section. Natural connection: ACD extends the consciousness-selection picture to reality's information allocation.
2. **[[quantum-consciousness]]** — In "What These Theories Share" section. Natural connection: all quantum consciousness mechanisms are compatible with ACD's framework.
3. **[[stapp-quantum-mind]]** — In Attention-as-Interface bandwidth limitation paragraph. Natural connection: policy-level operation aligns with ACD's coarse-grained selection.
4. **[[computational-cognitive-limits]]** — In Computational Irreducibility section. Natural connection: Wolfram's thesis supports ACD's real-time allocation by non-computable consciousness.
5. **[[bidirectional-interaction]]** — In Quantum Interface section. Natural connection: ACD captures the selective actualisation that bidirectional interaction requires.
6. **[[consciousness-and-mathematical-cognition]]** — In Penrose's Gödelian Argument section. Natural connection: Penrose's non-computability argument undergirds ACD.

### Word Count
1693 → 1715 (+22 words). Well within soft threshold of 2500.

## Remaining Items

None. The article now has **17 inbound links** from content articles spanning:
- Previous reviews: simulation, participatory universe, physics of information, neural selection, prebiotic collapse, neural bandwidth, attentional economics, phenomenal depth, attention-as-selection, metaphysics of information, machine consciousness
- This review: measurement problem, quantum consciousness, Stapp quantum mind, computational cognitive limits, bidirectional interaction, consciousness and mathematical cognition

## Stability Notes

- The article has reached full stability after 4 reviews. Content changes were minimal (1 typo fix, 2 outbound links added).
- The self-allocation objection remains a bedrock philosophical disagreement (documented in review 2).
- MWI incompatibility is a fundamental tenet commitment, not a fixable flaw.
- Unfalsifiability of consciousness-based quantum interpretations is characteristic of the entire Map framework.
- The article is now thoroughly integrated with 17 inbound links across all major sections of the site. Future reviews should not need to focus on orphan integration.
