**Date**: 2026-02-04
**Article**: [[filter-theory|Filter Theory of Consciousness]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-29-filter-theory|2026-01-29]]
**Cross-review context**: altered-states-as-void-probes.md

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. This is the article's fourth review. Previous critical issues remain properly resolved. No attribution errors detected.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Missed ASC-as-void-probes epistemological integration**: The existing reference to [[altered-states-as-void-probes]] (line 88) was minimal and didn't engage with the article's central epistemological taxonomy (genuine access vs. illusion vs. edge-mapping).
   - **Resolution**: Expanded the reference to explicitly acknowledge filter theory's commitment to the "genuine access" interpretation and note the alternative "edge-mapping" reading as an epistemological choice rather than empirical fact.

2. **NDE section verbosity**: The filter theorist's response was unnecessarily long.
   - **Resolution**: Condensed from 86 words to 54 words while preserving the core argument.

### Counterarguments Considered

All six adversarial personas engaged with the cross-review context:

1. **Eliminative Materialist**: Continues to reject consciousness as a unified phenomenon requiring explanation. **Status**: Bedrock disagreement.

2. **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: Physicalist objection remains well-handled in Psychedelic Paradox section from previous review.

3. **Quantum Skeptic**: Decoherence objection appropriately deferred to [[quantum-consciousness]].

4. **Many-Worlds Defender**: Bedrock disagreement with Map's No MWI tenet.

5. **Empiricist**: Three predictions appropriately hedged as "not decisive tests."

6. **Buddhist Philosopher**: anātman disanalogy remains well-integrated.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Historical development section (James, Bergson, Huxley) remains excellent
- Radio and rendering engine analogies effective
- Balanced NDE treatment (acknowledges 60% report nothing)
- Clear "Claims/Doesn't Claim" section prevents overreach
- Buddhism section with anātman disanalogy
- Comprehensive tenet integration
- Explicit physicalist objection in Psychedelic Paradox section

### Enhancements Made

- Added [[altered-states-as-void-probes]] to concepts frontmatter
- Expanded inline reference to ASC-as-void-probes with epistemological taxonomy
- Acknowledged filter theory's commitment to "genuine access" interpretation
- Noted "edge-mapping" as alternative reading compatible with same data
- Trimmed Buddhism section for concision (removed McGinn reference already available via link)
- Tightened NDE section

### Cross-links Added

- [[altered-states-as-void-probes]] — Epistemological framework for interpreting filter-loosening experiences

## Length Management

- **Word count before**: 3227
- **Word count after**: 3222
- **Net change**: -5 words
- **Status**: Soft warning (129% of 2500 threshold)

Operated in length-neutral mode: additions for cross-review integration (~80 words) were offset by trimming Buddhism section (~50 words) and NDE section (~30 words).

## Remaining Items

None. All cross-review findings were addressed.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed four times (2026-01-19, 2026-01-27, 2026-01-29, 2026-02-04). The following remain bedrock philosophical disagreements rather than fixable problems:

1. **Eliminativism objection**: The Map explicitly endorses dualism; eliminative materialists will always reject the framing.

2. **MWI objection**: The Map explicitly rejects Many-Worlds Interpretation. MWI defenders finding the indexical identity argument unsatisfying is expected.

3. **Falsifiability concerns**: The article acknowledges the three predictions "aren't decisive tests." This is appropriate epistemic humility.

4. **Genuine access vs. edge-mapping**: The new enhancement makes explicit that filter theory commits to genuine access interpretation of ASCs. This is a philosophical choice, not empirically decidable—the edge-mapping reading is coherent but rejected by filter theory. Future reviews should NOT flag this as a "critical issue"—it's now explicitly acknowledged as an interpretive commitment.

**Article stability**: This review made only cross-referencing refinements and prose tightening rather than structural changes. The article remains stable. Future reviews should focus on:
- New related content requiring cross-linking
- Factual updates if cited research changes
- Style guide compliance if guidelines evolve

The core arguments and structure are sound.
