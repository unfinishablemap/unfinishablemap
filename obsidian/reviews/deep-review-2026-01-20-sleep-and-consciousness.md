**Article**: [[sleep-and-consciousness|Sleep and Consciousness]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Missing Illusionist Challenge section**: Added comprehensive section with four responses (asymmetry of dreamless sleep, regress problem, lucid dreaming as counter-example, contemplative challenge). Now engages with Dennett/Frankish framework directly.
- **Missing Process Philosophy section**: Added section covering Whitehead's actual occasions framework applied to sleep (reconfigured prehension, binding problem reconsidered, why witness can persist, temporal experience in dreams).
- **Missing "What Would Challenge This View?" section**: Added five falsifiability conditions (posterior hot zone correlation, memory consolidation experience, sleep yoga reliability, lucid dreaming trainability, bandwidth limitation contingency).

### Medium Issues Found
- **Relation to Site Perspective incomplete**: Substantially expanded all five tenet connections with concrete mechanisms (quantum Zeno for Minimal Quantum Interaction, haecceity for No Many Worlds, double dissociation for Dualism).
- **Missing cross-links**: Added links to [[illusionism]], [[introspection]], [[witness-consciousness]], [[decoherence]], [[haecceity]], [[altered-states-of-consciousness]].
- **Thin contemplative evidence**: Added "Contemplative Evidence: Sleep Yoga" section covering awareness without content, voluntary disengagement, and transformation upon return.

### Low Issues Found
- **Incomplete citations**: Fixed Nature Neuroscience 2023 citation with proper authors (Stickgold et al.) and details.
- **References section sparse**: Added 6 new references (Dennett, Evans-Wentz, Frankish, Melloni, Tallis, Whitehead).

### Counterarguments Considered
- The Dennettian reading that consciousness is merely self-modelling that turns off when not needed
- The possibility that contemplative reports of awareness-through-dreamless-sleep reflect undetected dreaming or waking
- The objection that lucid dreaming trainability might reflect trait variation rather than skill acquisition

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent opening paragraph with front-loaded key insights about gradations, bandwidth, and interface modes
- Strong evolutionary puzzle framing that motivates the investigation
- Original binding problem analysis distinguishing computational from phenomenal binding
- Clear consciousness spectrum table with neural signatures
- Effective interface hypothesis application to sleep states

### Enhancements Made
- Added "Contemplative Evidence: Sleep Yoga" section (500+ words) covering traditional practices and their implications
- Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section (600+ words) with four-part response
- Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section (400+ words) applying Whitehead's framework
- Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section (400+ words) with 5 falsifiability conditions
- Substantially expanded all 5 tenet connections with specific mechanisms and cross-references
- Added 6 new cross-links to Further Reading
- Added 6 new references

### Cross-links Added
- [[illusionism]]
- [[introspection]]
- [[witness-consciousness]]
- [[decoherence]]
- [[haecceity]]
- [[altered-states-of-consciousness]]

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues have been addressed. The article now follows the standard deep-review template with:
- Illusionist Challenge section with responses
- Process Philosophy perspective
- What Would Challenge This View? section with 5 falsifiability conditions
- Substantive tenet connections for all 5 tenets
- Comprehensive cross-linking
- Complete references
