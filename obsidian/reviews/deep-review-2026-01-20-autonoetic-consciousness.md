**Article**: [[autonoetic-consciousness|Autonoetic Consciousness]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Missing "What Would Challenge This View?" section**: Added comprehensive section with 5 falsifiability conditions (functional replication, phenomenology-function dissociation, categorical vs continuous distinction, successful illusionist account, binding without consciousness).
- **Missing engagement with illusionism**: Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section with regress response, introspection phenomenology, and contemplative evidence subsections.
- **Incomplete tenet coverage**: Original covered only 2-3 tenets explicitly. Expanded "Relation to Site Perspective" to cover all 5 tenets with substantive connections.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing Process Philosophy perspective**: Added comprehensive section on memory and actual occasions, concrescence and re-experiencing, and temporal thickness.
- **Section title inconsistency**: Changed "Relation to The Unfinishable Map's Perspective" to "Relation to Site Perspective" for consistency with other articles.
- **Missing cross-links**: Added 7 new concept links to frontmatter (illusionism, introspection, witness-consciousness, decoherence, haecceity, metacognition, episodic-memory).

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Illusionist objection**: That felt pastness and double presence are introspective misrepresentations. Addressed via regress argument and contemplative evidence.
- **Decoherence objection**: That quantum effects can't persist in warm biological systems. Acknowledged in binding section with standard responses (measurement problem remains, timescale debates).
- **Many-worlds compatibility**: Whether branching identity could be consistent with autonoetic experience. Strengthened No Many Worlds connection via haecceity link.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent opening summary that front-loads the key claim
- Thorough Tulving framework section with three types of consciousness
- Clear remember/know distinction explanation
- Compelling clinical evidence (Patient KC)
- Strong connection to working memory and specious present
- Original voice and accessible-but-rigorous tone

### Enhancements Made
- **The Illusionist Challenge**: New section (3 subsections) engaging Dennett/Frankish with Tallis response, introspection phenomenology, and contemplative evidence from witness consciousness traditions.
- **Process Philosophy Perspective**: New section (3 subsections) connecting Whitehead's actual occasions to memory as re-prehension, concrescence to re-experiencing, and temporal thickness to specious present.
- **What Would Challenge This View?**: New section with 5 numbered falsifiability conditions.
- **Expanded tenet coverage**: All 5 tenets now explicitly connected with substantive analysis, including Minimal Quantum Interaction (quantum selection in memory formation) and Occam's Razor Has Limits (remember/know distinction shows information alone is insufficient).
- **Strengthened Dualism connection**: Added illusionism reference and regress argument.
- **Strengthened No Many Worlds connection**: Added haecceity link explaining why indexical content matters.

### Cross-links Added
- [[illusionism]] — The challenge to phenomenal consciousness claims
- [[introspection]] — The method by which we access memory phenomenology
- [[witness-consciousness]] — Contemplative evidence for memory phenomena
- [[decoherence]] — The quantum challenge to binding mechanisms
- [[haecceity]] — The "thisness" that autonoetic consciousness presupposes
- [[metacognition]] — Thinking about thinking, including memory processes
- [[episodic-memory]] — The memory system that autonoetic consciousness accompanies

## Remaining Items

None. All critical and medium issues addressed. The article now follows the standard deep-review template with illusionist engagement, process philosophy perspective, falsifiability conditions, and full tenet coverage.
