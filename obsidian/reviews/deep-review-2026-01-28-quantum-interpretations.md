# Deep Review: Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics

**Date**: 2026-01-28
**File**: obsidian/concepts/quantum-interpretations.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-21
**Context**: Cross-review considering new [[qbism]] article

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The previous review (2026-01-21) resolved all major structural gaps. The article has all required sections: Illusionist Challenge, Process Philosophy Perspective, Contemplative Evidence, What Would Challenge This View?, and complete Relation to Site Perspective.

### Medium Issues Found
- **QBism cross-reference missing**: The new qbism.md article (created 2026-01-28) provides detailed treatment of QBism but wasn't linked from quantum-interpretations.md.
  - *Resolution*: Added [[qbism]] links in QBism subsection, probability section, Further Reading, and frontmatter concepts.

- **MWI indexical response unacknowledged**: The qbism.md article (lines 70-73) includes MWI defenders' response to the indexical problem ("why am I this person rather than another?"). This response was absent from quantum-interpretations.md.
  - *Resolution*: Added acknowledgment of MWI response before the Map's counter-position in the indexical identity section.

### Counterarguments Considered
- MWI defenders argue indexical self-location is no more mysterious than ordinary self-location uncertainty
- Response included: The Map holds that indexical identity is precisely what requires explanation, not what explains things away

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Front-loaded opening summary clearly states core position
- Comparison table provides excellent quick reference
- Process philosophy section offers distinctive philosophical framework
- Contemplative evidence grounds abstract claims in phenomenology
- "What Would Challenge This View?" demonstrates intellectual honesty
- All five tenets addressed substantively in Relation to Site Perspective

### Enhancements Made
- Cross-linked to new [[qbism]] article in three locations
- Added [[qbism]] to frontmatter concepts
- Included MWI defenders' indexical response with Map's rebuttal
- Trimmed redundant QBism exposition (now handled by dedicated article)

### Cross-links Added
- [[qbism]] (new article integration)

## Length Management

**Word count**: 3596 → 3625 (+29 words)

Operated in length-neutral mode due to hard threshold (3500 words for concepts/). Added ~50 words for MWI response and cross-links, trimmed ~20 words from QBism sections now covered by dedicated article. Net increase acceptable given improved cross-article coherence.

## Remaining Items

None. This was a targeted cross-review to integrate the new qbism.md article with the existing quantum-interpretations.md survey.

## Stability Notes

The article has now been reviewed twice (2026-01-21, 2026-01-28). The first review added all standard sections; this review addressed cross-article consistency following new content creation. The article should be considered stable unless:
1. Additional interpretation articles are created requiring cross-reference
2. Significant new physics research emerges
3. Substantive content changes warrant re-review

Philosophical disagreements from adversarial personas (eliminative materialist, Dennett's heterophenomenology, MWI probability defense) represent bedrock disagreements rather than fixable problems—this is a dualist site that takes consciousness seriously, and critics who don't will always find the position unsatisfying.
