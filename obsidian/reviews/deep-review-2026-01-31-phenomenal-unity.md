**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Article**: [[phenomenal-unity|Phenomenal Unity]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-28-phenomenal-unity|2026-01-28]]
**Context**: Cross-review considering process-and-consciousness apex

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. This is the fourth deep review. The article has been stable since the third review (2026-01-28).

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Missing cross-link to process-and-consciousness apex**: The new apex article lists phenomenal-unity.md as a source and discusses Whitehead's actual occasions in relation to phenomenal unity. Bidirectional linking was missing.
   - *Resolution*: Added [[process-and-consciousness]] to related_articles frontmatter and Further Reading section.

### Low Issues Found

None new.

### Counterarguments Considered

All six adversarial personas found philosophical disagreements rather than errors:
- **Eliminativist**: Unity-as-precondition-for-illusion argument already present
- **Dennettian**: Multiple drafts engaged; philosophical standoff
- **Tegmark**: Decoherence debate properly caveated
- **MWI defender**: Site tenet commitment, not fixable
- **Empiricist**: Falsifiability section adequate
- **Buddhist**: Unaddressed but represents fundamental disagreement about subjecthood

### Attribution Accuracy Check

Verified all source attributions:
- Leibniz's mill argument: Accurate
- Dennett's multiple drafts: Fair characterization
- James on combination problem: Accurate
- Bayne & Chalmers, Tegmark, Hagan et al., Kerskens & Pérez, Warren, Wiest et al.: All properly attributed

No attribution errors found.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Opening summary front-loads key claim (survives truncation)
- Three-dimensional taxonomy of unity (synchronic/diachronic/subject)
- Classical vs quantum comparison table
- "What Would Challenge This View?" falsifiability section
- Strong tenet connections in "Relation to Site Perspective"
- Comprehensive cross-linking to related content
- Whitehead/actual occasions mention in quantum section

### Enhancements Made

1. **Cross-link to process-and-consciousness apex** (~20 words): Added to related_articles frontmatter and first position in Further Reading with description explaining the synthesis connection.

### Cross-links Added

- [[process-and-consciousness]] — in Further Reading (first position) and related_articles frontmatter

## Word Count

- Before: 3297 words (132% of 2500 soft threshold)
- After: ~3315 words (133% of 2500 soft threshold)
- Change: +18 words (minimal increase for cross-linking)

Note: Operating in length-neutral mode. The addition of one Further Reading entry with description is the minimum necessary for bidirectional linking with the apex article. No body text expansion was performed.

## Remaining Items

None.

## Stability Notes

This is the fourth deep review of this article. Previous reviews addressed:
- 2026-01-20: Added falsifiability section, illusionist challenge engagement, combination problem connection
- 2026-01-27: Refined empirical evidence claims, added appropriate caveats
- 2026-01-28: Cross-review with neural-binding-mechanisms.md; added cross-links, Stapp and Whitehead references, condensed classical mechanisms coverage

This cross-review focused on integration with the new process-and-consciousness apex article:
- Added bidirectional cross-link establishing phenomenal-unity as a source article

The article has reached full stability. Key philosophical disagreements are acknowledged as bedrock disagreements:
- **Eliminativist/Dennettian challenge**: Addressed; represents phenomenal realism disagreement
- **MWI defender position**: Site tenet commitment
- **Buddhist no-self challenge**: Fundamental disagreement about subjecthood

Future reviews should focus on new empirical developments or new cross-linking opportunities rather than restructuring. The article's core arguments are sound and its integration with related content is now complete.
