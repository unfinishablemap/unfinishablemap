# Deep Review: The Combination Problem

**Date**: 2026-01-19
**File**: obsidian/concepts/combination-problem.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None identified.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Missing cross-links to related concepts**: The article lacked connections to phenomenal-unity.md and binding-problem.md, which directly address the subject-summing and structural aspects of the combination problem.
   - *Resolution*: Added both to frontmatter concepts and Further Reading section.

2. **No engagement with deflationary responses**: Buddhist no-self views and process philosophy offer dissolution strategies for the subject-summing problem that were not acknowledged.
   - *Resolution*: Added paragraph after Coleman's argument acknowledging these perspectives while noting most panpsychists don't adopt them.

3. **Empirical distinguishability claims lacked specificity**: The comparison table claimed interactionism allows "empirical investigation" but didn't specify what predictions this generates.
   - *Resolution*: Added new "Empirical Distinguishability" subsection with three concrete lines of evidence (quantum coherence measurements, simple organism studies, anesthesia/microtubule research).

4. **Missing minimal-consciousness cross-link**: The article discusses how the problem manifests but didn't connect to empirical work on simple organisms testing these predictions.
   - *Resolution*: Added minimal-consciousness.md to frontmatter and Further Reading.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Eliminativist dissolution**: The view that "micro-experiences" is folk-psychological confusion was noted but not addressed, as the article is framed for readers who take panpsychism seriously as a position.
- **MWI implications**: Many-worlds interpretation changes how combination works (all combinations occur in some branch), but this is addressed elsewhere in site's MWI critique.
- **Mysterian position**: Both problems may be permanently beyond human cognitive capacity—noted implicitly in "structurally similar challenge" language.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Clear systematic presentation of Chalmers' four dimensions (subject-summing, palette, grain, structure)
- Effective use of James's "shut in their own skin" phenomenological observation
- Well-structured comparison table between panpsychism and interactionism challenges
- Balanced "What Panpsychism Gets Right" section acknowledging shared insights
- Strong tenet connections in Relation to Site Perspective

### Enhancements Made

1. Added process philosophy/Buddhist perspective on subject-summing dissolution
2. Added new "Empirical Distinguishability" subsection with specific testable predictions
3. Expanded references with recent empirical work (Kerskens & Pérez 2022, Wiest et al. 2024)
4. Added three new cross-links (phenomenal-unity, binding-problem, minimal-consciousness)

### Cross-links Added

- [[phenomenal-unity]] — Why experience is unified (directly relevant to subject-summing)
- [[binding-problem]] — Neural coordination challenge (related mechanism)
- [[minimal-consciousness]] — Empirical testing ground (C. elegans, Hydra)

## Remaining Items

None. All medium-priority issues were addressed in this session.
