# Deep Review: Mysterianism and Cognitive Closure

**Date**: 2026-01-30
**File**: obsidian/concepts/mysterianism.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-30 (questioning-as-evidence cross-review)
**Cross-review context**: natural-vs-designed-limits voids article (voids/natural-vs-designed-limits.md)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. Article remains stable with accurate attributions.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing cross-link to natural-vs-designed-limits**: The article describes McGinn's cognitive closure as "transcendental naturalism"—assuming limits are natural features of finite minds. The new voids article directly questions whether this assumption is testable, asking whether cognitive closure could be *designed* rather than natural. This dimension was not referenced. **Resolution**: Added one sentence with cross-link in the Cognitive Closure section.

### Low Issues Found
None.

### Attribution Check
All attributions verified accurate (carried forward from previous review):
- McGinn's cognitive closure (1989): ✓
- Nagel's bat argument (1974): ✓
- Chomsky's problems vs. mysteries: ✓
- Fodor's concept nativism: ✓
- Russell/Eddington intrinsic nature: ✓
- Penrose's mathematical understanding: ✓

### Counterarguments Considered
All six adversarial personas engaged with the natural-vs-designed question:
- **Eliminative Materialist**: The "natural" framing may be biased—addressed via cross-link
- **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: Prior question exists about limit origins—addressed via cross-link
- **Quantum Skeptic**: No specific issues
- **Many-Worlds Defender**: No new issues
- **Empiricist**: Falsifiability section doesn't include "discovering limits are designed"—this is a philosophical meta-question, not a testable challenge
- **Buddhist Philosopher**: Bedrock disagreement about substantialist framework—not re-flagged

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent McGinn cognitive closure presentation
- C. elegans empirical evidence section
- Strong phenomenology of cognitive closure section
- Comprehensive tenet connections
- Previous cross-review additions (questioning-as-evidence insight)

### Enhancements Made
1. **Added natural-vs-designed cross-link**: In the Cognitive Closure section, added: "McGinn's framework assumes our limits are *natural* features of finite minds; whether this assumption can even be tested is itself a [[natural-vs-designed-limits|prior question]] the voids framework explores."

This connects mysterianism to:
- The simulation hypothesis (designed limits)
- The meta-void question (can we distinguish natural from designed?)
- The voids framework's approach to cognitive limits

### Cross-links Added
- [[natural-vs-designed-limits]] — Added to related_articles and in-text

## Word Count
- Before: 2635 words (105% of 2500 soft threshold)
- After: 2658 words (106% of 2500 soft threshold)
- Net change: +23 words (minor increase, partially offset by trimming "to the mind-body problem")

## Remaining Items

None. The cross-review integration is complete.

## Stability Notes

This is the **seventh deep review** of this article. Key stability markers:

1. **Bedrock disagreements (do not re-flag)**:
   - Eliminativists will always question whether "phenomenal consciousness" is coherent
   - Buddhist philosophers will question the substantialist framework
   - These represent philosophical standoffs, not article flaws

2. **Convergence achieved**:
   - 2026-01-20: Added illusionism, process philosophy, falsifiability, full tenets
   - 2026-01-27: Added intrinsic nature connection, computational limits distinction
   - 2026-01-28: Added bidirectional link to convergent-cognitive-limits
   - 2026-01-29: Added bidirectional link to origin-of-consciousness
   - 2026-01-30 (morning): Added questioning-as-evidence transcendental insight
   - 2026-01-30 (evening): Added natural-vs-designed cross-link

3. **Article is at stability**:
   - All major philosophical positions engaged
   - All tenets covered with specific connections
   - Now cross-linked to natural-vs-designed-limits voids content
   - Word count slightly above soft threshold but stable
   - Future reviews should only address: new related content, significant literature developments, or broken links

The natural-vs-designed cross-link was appropriate: it connects mysterianism to a genuine new dimension explored in the voids framework without disrupting the article's existing structure. McGinn's "transcendental naturalism" assumption is now explicitly noted as one that the Map's voids framework questions.
