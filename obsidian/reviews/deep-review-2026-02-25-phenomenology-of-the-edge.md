**Date**: 2026-02-25
**Article**: [[phenomenology-of-the-edge|The Phenomenology of the Edge]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-03c-phenomenology-of-the-edge|2026-02-03]]
**Context**: Cross-review considering mind-space-void insights

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. Article remains stable. Attribution accuracy check passed on all six dimensions.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing cross-link to mind-space-void**: The newly created mind-space void article is directly relevant—both explore consciousness at its limits, and the mind-space boundary represents another edge type not previously listed. **Resolution**: Added mind-space boundary to "Multiple edges exist" section, added to Further Reading and related_articles.

### Attribution Accuracy Check
All checks passed:
- Misattribution: None (James, Metzinger, Millière, Kriegel, McGinn accurately cited)
- Qualifier preservation: Intact
- Position strength: Appropriately hedged
- Source/Map separation: Clear
- Self-contradiction: None

### Counterarguments Considered
All six adversarial personas engaged. No new issues beyond bedrock disagreements identified in previous reviews:
1. **Eliminative materialist**: Edge-clarity as low-noise brain states. Addressed by "specificity is data" argument.
2. **Heterophenomenologist**: Zero-person reports are still reports. Addressed in witness-consciousness article.
3. **Quantum skeptic**: Filter theory lacks mechanism. Correctly framed as Map's position.
4. **MWI defender**: Edge-experiences as decoherence effects. Tenet-level disagreement.
5. **Empiricist**: Falsifiability unclear. Deferred—would require word count increase.
6. **Buddhist philosopher**: Risks reifying consciousness. Philosophical difference from dualist framework.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening summary (front-loaded, truncation-resilient)
- Edge-experience profile table
- Dissolving-insight phenomenon (distinctive contribution)
- Upper/lower edge convergence insight
- Kriegel's representational/psychological closure distinction
- Cross-method convergence argument
- All five tenet connections

### Cross-Review Assessment: Mind-Space-Void Insights
The mind-space void article introduces the question of self-location in the space of possible minds. Key connections to edge-phenomenology:
- Edge-experiences may represent the closest we come to "shifting position" in mind-space—consciousness temporarily freed from its usual configuration
- The zero-person perspective (MPE) suggests consciousness can operate without a particular "location" identity
- The "illusion of centrality" that mind-space void describes is precisely what dissolves in ego-dissolution edge-experiences
- Mind-space boundary is a natural addition to the "multiple edges" taxonomy

Integration kept minimal due to word count constraints (article at 117% of soft threshold). Cross-link added at the taxonomic level rather than developing the philosophical connection in prose.

### Enhancements Made
- Added `[[mind-space-void]]` to related_articles frontmatter
- Added mind-space boundary to "Multiple edges exist" section
- Added mind-space-void to Further Reading
- Trimmed redundant "Comparative analysis" subsection (cross-cultural consistency point appeared three times)

### Cross-links Added
- [[mind-space-void]]

## Remaining Items

None. Cross-review integration is complete at the appropriate level given word count constraints.

## Word Count

2341 → 2350 words (+9, length-neutral)

## Stability Notes

Article remains at high stability after five deep reviews. The mind-space-void cross-link was the only warranted change—new content requiring integration, not a quality issue. Previous convergence notes still apply:
- Adversarial persona objections are bedrock disagreements, not fixable flaws
- Empiricist falsifiability concern deferred due to word count constraints
- Nagarjuna reification concern is philosophical difference from Map's framework
- Future reviews should only occur if new related content requires cross-linking or if article is substantively modified
