**Article**: [[default-mode-network|Default Mode Network]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None. The article is well-structured with appropriate sourcing.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Opening lacked framing**: The opening presented filter theory without clearly distinguishing it from standard physicalist interpretation. *Resolution: Added explicit acknowledgment that both interpretations account for the same data.*
- **REBUS attribution incomplete**: Carhart-Harris's REBUS model was cited without noting he interprets it physicalistically. *Resolution: Added clarification that Carhart-Harris himself works within a physicalist framework.*
- **Physicalist objection unaddressed**: The filter theory section didn't engage with the straightforward physicalist reading of the evidence. *Resolution: Added explicit physicalist objection and response explaining what makes the filter view attractive despite not providing additional evidence against physicalism.*

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Physicalist objection**: "Different neural processing produces different experience—no filter required." Addressed by adding explicit engagement with this objection and noting the filter interpretation's coherence with the hard problem.
- **Phenomenological reliability**: Reports from altered states don't entail ontological conclusions. The article already handled this appropriately by framing these as evidence consistent with filter theory rather than proof.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear structure moving from empirical findings to philosophical interpretation
- Well-sourced factual claims with appropriate academic references
- Filter theory presented as alternative reading, not proven fact
- Strong integration of multiple evidence lines (psychedelics, meditation, flow states)
- Excellent "What Would Challenge This View?" section providing falsifiability criteria
- Comprehensive "Relation to Site Perspective" section engaging all relevant tenets

### Enhancements Made
- Opening now explicitly acknowledges both physicalist and filter interpretations of DMN data
- REBUS section clarified that Carhart-Harris works within physicalist framework
- Added direct engagement with physicalist objection in filter theory section
- Linked hard problem explicitly where it becomes most relevant

### Cross-links Added
- [[hard-problem-of-consciousness]] — added in new physicalist objection paragraph

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues have been addressed.

## Stability Notes

The following represent fundamental philosophical disagreements rather than fixable problems:

- **Eliminative materialist objection**: Critics will always argue that correlation between neural activity and experience supports production models over filter models. This is a bedrock interpretive difference—the same data admits both readings. The article now explicitly acknowledges this.

- **Phenomenological reliability concerns**: Dennettian objections about trusting introspective reports from altered states represent an ongoing philosophical debate about methodology, not a deficiency in this article.

- **Quantum speculation**: The brief mention of minimal quantum interaction in the tenets section is appropriately hedged as speculative. Future reviews should not expand or remove this—the current balance is appropriate.
