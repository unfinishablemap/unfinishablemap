**Date**: 2026-02-04
**Article**: [[attention-disorders-and-quantum-interface|Attention Disorders and the Quantum Interface]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-01-attention-disorders-and-quantum-interface|2026-02-01]]

## Review Focus

This review focused on **orphan integration**: the article had no inbound links despite being thematically central to the Map's attention-as-interface framework. The primary goal was to add cross-references from existing articles to integrate this content into site navigation.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The previous review (2026-02-01) addressed the only critical issue (Nature study misquotation). The article has not been modified since and remains stable.

### Medium Issues Found
None new. Previous review addressed framing issues.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Functionalist objection**: ADHD evidence is "consistent with" dualism but also with functionalist accounts. The article already uses appropriate hedging ("consistent with" rather than "proves").
- **Quantum skeptic objection**: Zeno mechanism is presented as one candidate, not established fact. Article maintains epistemic humility.
- **Physicalist objection on effort**: Already acknowledged as bedrock philosophical disagreement in previous review.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent narrative flow: ADHD → Fatigue → Meditation → Clinical → Theory
- The attention type table (exogenous/instructed/willed with ADHD effects) remains highly effective
- Strong "What Disorders Don't Show" section maintaining epistemic humility
- Each tenet addressed substantively in Relation to Site Perspective
- Clinical implications framework adds real-world relevance
- 2072 words (69% of 3000 soft threshold) — healthy length, room for expansion if needed

### Enhancements Made
No content changes to the article itself. The article was stable and well-written.

### Cross-links Added (Orphan Integration)

Added inbound links from 7 related articles:

1. **attention-as-interface.md** — Added to Further Reading: "Attention Disorders and the Interface"
2. **mental-effort.md** — Added: "How ADHD, fatigue, and meditation deficits reveal interface properties"
3. **dopamine-selection-interface.md** — Added: "ADHD as threshold dysregulation—concrete example of dopamine-interface dysfunction"
4. **voluntary-attention.md** — Added: "ADHD selectively impairs willed attention while preserving captured attention"
5. **structure-of-attention.md** — Added: "ADHD, fatigue, and meditation deficits reveal interface components"
6. **meditation-and-consciousness-modes.md** — Added: "Meditation deficits reveal interface training requirements"
7. **consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns.md** — Added: "ADHD, OCD, and meditation deficits reveal selection interface dysfunction"

## Remaining Items

None. The article is stable and now properly integrated into the site through inbound links.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed twice (2026-02-01 and 2026-02-04) and reached stability:

- **Quantum Zeno mechanism** is presented appropriately as one candidate—not a problem to flag
- **Epistemic humility** ("don't prove the quantum interface model") is a feature, not weakness
- **Functionalist/physicalist disagreement** is an expected philosophical standoff, not a critical flaw
- The article explicitly acknowledges what disorders "don't show"—this self-aware limitation strengthens rather than weakens the piece

Future reviews should focus on whether new research has emerged that could strengthen or challenge the claims, not on re-litigating fundamental philosophical disputes already addressed.
