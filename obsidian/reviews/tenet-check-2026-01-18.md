# Tenet Alignment Check

**Date**: 2026-01-18
**Files checked**: 99 (15 topics + 84 concepts)
**Errors**: 0
**Warnings**: 0
**Notes**: 3

## Summary

All site content aligns with the five foundational tenets. No direct contradictions or implicit conflicts were found. the site demonstrates sophisticated, internally consistent application of its commitments. Opposing views (materialism, illusionism, epiphenomenalism, MWI) are presented fairly and clearly marked as positions the site rejects, with substantive arguments against each.

Three minor notes identify areas where clarification could strengthen presentation, but these are not compliance issues.

## Tenet-by-Tenet Analysis

### 1. Dualism

**Status: Fully Aligned** ✓

All major files defend or presuppose dualism. Key examples:
- `materialism.md` systematically refutes eliminativism and illusionism
- `hard-problem-of-consciousness.md` frames the hard problem as foundation for the Dualism tenet
- `animal-consciousness.md` explicitly states dualism is "better positioned" than materialism to take animal consciousness seriously
- `illusionism.md` presents illusionism as a challenge, then dedicates 80+ lines to explaining why it fails

**No violations detected.**

### 2. Minimal Quantum Interaction

**Status: Fully Aligned** ✓

The framework carefully distinguishes legitimate quantum consciousness research from "quantum woo":
- `quantum-consciousness.md` contains explicit "Distinguishing from Quantum Woo" section
- Proposed mechanisms (Orch OR, Stapp's quantum Zeno, Fisher's Posner molecules) engage with physics, respect conservation laws, and acknowledge empirical challenges
- `causal-closure.md` explains consciousness operates at indeterminacies where physics leaves outcomes undetermined—no energy injection

**No violations detected.**

### 3. Bidirectional Interaction

**Status: Fully Aligned** ✓

The site consistently rejects epiphenomenalism:
- `epiphenomenalism.md` contains powerful "Self-Stultification Problem" showing epiphenomenalism undermines itself
- `filter-theory.md` explicitly provides bidirectionality: brain-to-consciousness and consciousness-to-brain
- `emergence.md` articulates quantum mechanism for downward causation
- `libet-experiments.md` proposes retrocausal resolution to temporal ordering objection

**No violations detected.**

### 4. No Many Worlds

**Status: Fully Aligned** ✓

The site's rejection of MWI is clear:
- `quantum-interpretations.md` explicitly lists "No Many Worlds" as foundational commitment
- `quantum-consciousness.md` explains consciousness plays a role only if collapse is real
- `personal-identity.md` and `meaning-of-life.md` use indexical identity (from No MWI) to ground meaning

**No violations detected.**

### 5. Occam's Razor Has Limits

**Status: Fully Aligned** ✓

The site consistently challenges naive applications of parsimony:
- `arguments-for-dualism.md` dedicates substantial space to the parsimony objection
- `mysterianism.md` explicitly supports the tenet via McGinn's cognitive closure
- All files invoking parsimony do so to *challenge* simplicity-based arguments, not endorse them

**No violations detected.**

## Notes

### Note 1: Quantum Mechanism Speculation

**File**: `quantum-consciousness.md`
**Observation**: The file (470+ lines) contains significant speculation on mechanisms with varying empirical support.
**Clarification**: The file properly notes the site "remains agnostic about mechanism" but this caveat appears late. Consider adding earlier explicit statement of mechanism agnosticism.
**Assessment**: Not a violation—pedagogically reasonable to explain proposals before caveating.

### Note 2: Mysterianism Connection

**File**: `mysterianism.md`
**Observation**: Doesn't explicitly connect to how the site moves beyond mysterianism (through quantum framework).
**Clarification**: Could add sentence noting that while mysterians claim unsolvability, this site proposes a solution via quantum interaction.
**Assessment**: Not a violation—the connection is implicit but could be made explicit.

### Note 3: Filter Theory and Selection

**Files**: `filter-theory.md`, `mind-matter-interface.md`
**Observation**: The relationship between filter theory (transmission) and selection mechanisms (causation) could be clearer.
**Clarification**: `mind-matter-interface.md` addresses this by treating them as complementary layers, but some readers may find the two-layer model initially confusing.
**Assessment**: Not a violation—the files are consistent, just potentially unclear to newcomers.

## Cross-Tenet Consistency

No internal tensions between tenets were found:
- Dualism + Bidirectional Interaction: Reconciled via quantum mechanism
- No Many Worlds + Bidirectional Interaction: Consistent—collapse creates definite facts consciousness can influence
- Minimal Quantum Interaction + Occam's Razor Has Limits: Consistent—acknowledged as more complex but justified by explanatory power

## Files Passing All Checks

### Topics (15/15)
- animal-consciousness.md
- ai-consciousness.md
- death-and-consciousness.md
- eastern-philosophy-consciousness.md
- epistemic-advantages-of-dualism.md
- ethics-of-consciousness.md
- free-will.md
- hard-problem-of-consciousness.md
- loss-of-consciousness.md
- meaning-of-life.md
- personal-identity.md
- purpose-and-alignment.md
- split-brain-consciousness.md
- time-collapse-and-agency.md
- topics.md (index)

### Concepts (84/84)
All concept files pass alignment checks. Particularly strong alignment in:
- materialism.md (systematic refutation of physicalism)
- epiphenomenalism.md (self-stultification argument)
- quantum-interpretations.md (explicit tenet discussion)
- arguments-for-dualism.md (comprehensive case with objection responses)
- filter-theory.md (theoretical framework supporting Dualism and Bidirectional Interaction)

## Conclusion

The site maintains excellent tenet alignment. Content is philosophically rigorous, opposing views are treated fairly, and the framework is internally consistent. The three notes identify minor presentation improvements, not compliance issues.
