**Date**: 2026-01-29
**Article**: [[delegatory-dualism|Delegatory Dualism]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-29-delegatory-dualism|2026-01-29]]

## Review Context

This is the second review of this article on the same day. The first review addressed multiple issues (illusionism engagement, MWI dependency, testability section). This review found the article in good shape with only minor refinement needed.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article has all required sections, accurate attribution, and appropriate tenet connections.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Heterophenomenology engagement missing**: The illusionism response could be strengthened by noting that heterophenomenology itself presupposes a phenomenal stance to identify what counts as a conscious report.
   - **Resolution**: Added one sentence to the illusionism paragraph noting that heterophenomenology must identify which behaviors count as "conscious reports"—a categorization relying on phenomenal concepts.

### Low Issues Found
None requiring action. The testability section appropriately acknowledges methodological challenges.

### Counterarguments Considered
1. **Eliminative materialist objection**: The framework assumes folk psychological categories are coherent.
   - **Status**: Bedrock philosophical disagreement. The Map commits to dualism.

2. **Dennett's heterophenomenology**: Reports about consciousness need not be caused by phenomenal states.
   - **Status**: Now addressed via the illusionism response enhancement.

3. **MWI objection**: Previously addressed; remains a bedrock disagreement.

4. **Buddhist no-self objection**: Questions the substantial subject of delegation.
   - **Status**: Meta-level critique of dualism generally, not specific to this article.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- The major/sergeant preemption analogy — memorable and clarifying
- The five constraints framework — elegant organizational structure
- The observational vs. universal closure distinction — key theoretical contribution
- The substantive Relation to Site Perspective section — connects to all five tenets
- The "What Delegation Explains" section — shows genuine explanatory power
- The honest acknowledgment of testability challenges

### Enhancements Made
1. Added heterophenomenology engagement to strengthen the illusionism response

### Cross-links
No new cross-links needed. The article already links appropriately to: interactionist-dualism, epiphenomenalism, mental-causation, causal-closure, psychophysical-laws, illusionism, many-worlds, tenets, conservation-laws-and-mind

- Change: +26 words

## Remaining Items
None. The article is approaching stability.

## Stability Notes

**This article has now been reviewed twice.** It shows signs of convergence:

- **MWI proponents will still disagree**: The article explicitly acknowledges dependence on collapse-based QM. This is a bedrock commitment tied to the Map's No Many-Worlds tenet, not a fixable flaw.

- **Illusionists/eliminativists will still disagree**: The article now engages their position (including heterophenomenology) and explains why the Map finds it inadequate. This represents a philosophical standoff, not an oversight to fix.

- **Mechanism question remains open by design**: The article correctly distinguishes structural questions (delegation) from mechanistic questions (how interaction occurs). This is appropriate division of labor with the Map's quantum framework.

- **Empirical distinguishability is hard**: The article acknowledges this honestly. This is a challenge for all consciousness theories, not a unique weakness.

**Recommendation**: Barring substantive changes to the article's content, future reviews should find no critical issues and few if any medium issues. The article has reached a stable state where major philosophical objections are acknowledged as bedrock disagreements rather than addressable flaws.
