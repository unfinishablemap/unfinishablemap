## Article Reviewed

[[consciousness-and-agency|Consciousness and Agency]]

## Changed Sources

No sources modified since last synthesis (2026-02-10). This evolution pass focused on quality improvement through the six-persona review process.

## Pessimistic Review

### Clarity Critic

1. **Sartre paragraph jargon**: The pour-soi/en-soi terminology in "Agent Causation: The Agent as Source" was introduced without intuitive grounding. Readers unfamiliar with Sartre would be lost.
2. **Dense Time section**: "Time, Collapse, and Selection" packed Schurger, Sjöberg, retrocausality, atemporal selection, the mathematical function analogy, collapse-constituting-time, and Whitehead's concrescence into insufficient space with unclear transitions.
3. **Selector Model caveat**: The creative generation paragraph read as a correction appended to the selector model rather than a natural extension.
4. **Abrupt transitions**: The jump from "The Authorship Problem" to "The Selector Model" lacked a bridging sentence connecting the luck objection to what follows.

### Redundancy Hunter

1. "Consciousness selects among quantum possibilities" appeared in nearly identical phrasing in the opening, Selector Model, Agent Causation, Mental Causation, and Synthesis sections.
2. The Synthesis section partly restated explanations from earlier sections rather than adding new insight—particularly the "reasons-guided" and "phenomenally unified" characterizations.
3. Schurger/Sjöberg evidence appeared in nearly the same formulation as in the free-will source article.

### Narrative Flow Analyst

1. "The Capacity to Refrain" felt parenthetical—introduced contemplative practice without connecting back to the main argument flow.
2. The progression created an accessibility valley: accessible opening → accessible middle → highly technical Time section → accessible Moral Responsibility close.
3. The Synthesis section read more as summary than genuine synthesis until the final "lived experience" paragraph.

## Optimistic Review

### Connection Finder

1. The argument from reason provides a *non-phenomenological* route to mental causation—a distinctive safety net for the framework that deserved emphasis.
2. Process philosophy connections were mentioned briefly but could serve as a unifying thread showing the Map's position isn't metaphysically exceptional.
3. Delegatory dualism's major/sergeant analogy is already well-integrated.

### Synthesis Strengthener

1. The mutually supporting circular structure (agent causation → mental causation → quantum gap → collapse → agent causation) is the article's strongest synthetic insight.
2. Counterfactual reasoning as the mechanism transforming selection from arbitrary to reasons-responsive deserved more emphasis—it's the fulcrum of the framework.
3. The consciousness-value connection running bidirectionally (moral patienthood and moral agency) is uniquely synthetic.

### Human Reader Advocate

1. The opening is excellent—personal, accessible, immediately engaging.
2. The middle sections needed a concrete example to ground the abstractions.
3. The closing "you are not a passive spectator" passage is powerful and human-readable.
4. Sartre's analysis needed an intuitive gloss before technical terms.

## Length Assessment

- **Before**: 2875 words
- **After**: 3062 words
- **Target range**: 2500-4000 words
- **Status**: Comfortably within range; modest expansion for clarity improvements

## Changes Made

1. **Added bridging paragraph** between Authorship Problem and Selector Model, signposting how the three interlocking ideas (selector model, agent causation, reasons-responsiveness) address the challenges raised.
2. **Rewrote Sartre paragraph** with intuitive example (reflecting on anger, questioning it) before introducing pour-soi terminology.
3. **Improved transition into Capacity to Refrain** section with connecting sentence linking it to the reasons-responsive selection theme.
4. **Strengthened counterfactual reasoning paragraph** to emphasize it as the fulcrum that transforms selection from arbitrary quantum fluctuation into genuine deliberation.
5. **Broke up dense Time section** paragraph, adding a clear transition sentence between neuroscience evidence and the retrocausal resolution, and separating the mathematical function analogy for readability.
6. **Rewrote Synthesis section** to reduce redundancy and strengthen genuine synthesis: replaced the "phenomenally unified, temporally constitutive, reasons-responsive, generatively engaged" list with the mutual support structure as the leading insight, added cross-tradition convergence paragraph (empirical psychology, Sartre, process philosophy), and elevated the argument from reason as a safety net.
7. **Emphasized argument from reason** as a non-phenomenological route to mental causation in the Mental Causation section.
8. **Updated frontmatter**: ai_modified and apex_last_synthesis timestamps.
