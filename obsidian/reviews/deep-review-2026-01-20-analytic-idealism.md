# Deep Review: Analytic Idealism

**Date**: 2026-01-20
**File**: concepts/analytic-idealism.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None requiring immediate resolution.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Buddhist complications missing**: The article conflated Eastern idealism with Buddhism generally, when Madhyamaka Buddhism actually rejects both materialism and idealism. **Resolution**: Added new paragraph on "Buddhist complications" distinguishing Madhyamaka critique from Advaita Vedanta, with link to buddhism-and-dualism.md.

2. **Empirical distinguishability unaddressed**: The article didn't explore whether dualism vs. idealism could be empirically distinguished. **Resolution**: Added new section "Can the Debate Be Empirically Resolved?" discussing interface specificity, multiple observer scenarios, and filter theory predictions.

3. **Weak response to idealism's interaction solution**: The article dismissed idealism's claim to solve the interaction problem without adequate engagement. **Resolution**: Strengthened throughout by developing the "interface question" more systematically.

4. **Missing cross-links to newer content**: The task notes specifically mentioned phenomenal-value-realism.md, interface-locality.md, and multi-mind-collapse-problem.md. **Resolution**: Added frontmatter links and woven these concepts into the body text.

### Counterarguments Considered

1. **Idealism's parsimony argument**: "Why posit two fundamental substances when one suffices?" — Addressed by noting that idealism's "intrinsic structure of universal consciousness" plays the role physical law plays in dualism.

2. **Witness consciousness as evidence for idealism**: Contemplatives report dissolution of individual identity into universal awareness. — Addressed by adding new subsection showing filter theory can accommodate these reports without requiring idealism.

3. **Madhyamaka rejection of idealism**: Buddhist middle way rejects both eternalist (idealism) and nihilist (materialism) extremes. — Added to historical roots section.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Clear opening that immediately distinguishes site's dualism from Kastrup's idealism
- Strong "interaction problem reversed" argument (why can't consciousness appear however it wants?)
- Fair presentation of idealism's genuine advantages (dissolves hard problem, avoids interaction problem)
- Effective treatment of indexical identity implications

### Enhancements Made

1. Added "The Interface Question" subsection connecting to interface-locality and multi-mind-collapse-problem
2. Added "The Witness Consciousness Connection" subsection engaging filter theory
3. Added "Can the Debate Be Empirically Resolved?" section
4. Enhanced "Meaning and Value" paragraph with phenomenal-value-realism connection
5. Added Buddhist/Madhyamaka perspective to historical roots
6. Expanded Further Reading with seven new cross-links
7. Added Nāgārjuna to References

### Cross-links Added

- [[phenomenal-value-realism]] — Added to frontmatter and body (value implications)
- [[interface-locality]] — Added to frontmatter and new subsection
- [[multi-mind-collapse-problem]] — Added to frontmatter and new subsection
- [[filter-theory]] — Added to frontmatter and new subsection
- [[witness-consciousness]] — Added to frontmatter and new subsection
- [[buddhism-and-dualism]] — Added to historical roots
- [[idealism]] — Added to Further Reading

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues addressed.

## Changes Summary

The deep review enhanced the article's engagement with:
1. Buddhist critiques of idealism (avoiding conflation with Advaita)
2. the project's newer framework articles on interface locality and multi-mind coordination
3. Empirical distinguishability between dualism and idealism
4. Filter theory as a dualist alternative to idealist interpretations of contemplative evidence
5. Value theory implications through phenomenal value realism

Word count increased from ~2200 to ~3000 words. The article now provides stronger arguments for the project's preference for dualism while engaging more fairly with idealism's strongest points.
