# Deep Review: Locality and Mind-Matter Interaction

**Date**: 2026-01-19
**File**: obsidian/concepts/locality.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Missing cross-links to newer content**: The article predated interface-locality.md, brain-specialness.md, and pairing-problem.md which address related concerns in much more depth. → Added comprehensive cross-links and integrated references.
- **Sparse concepts frontmatter**: Only listed simulation; missing interactionist-dualism, quantum-consciousness, and other core concepts. → Expanded concepts list.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Response 2 underdeveloped**: The claim that "the mind side can have whatever structure it needs" was stated but not connected to the site's more developed treatment. → Added reference to brain-specialness.md's five criteria.
- **No engagement with pairing problem**: This is the more fundamental challenge. → Added explicit mention and link to pairing-problem.md.
- **Binding problem section thin**: Didn't connect to the actual binding-problem.md page or mention how quantum entanglement might help. → Added entanglement point and wikilink.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist critique**: Physical laws aren't agents "doing" coordination. → The article's response (that we accept physical law coordination without mechanism) remains appropriate; this is a leveling move.
- **Underdetermination critique**: The responses show locality isn't a barrier but don't establish that consciousness actually coordinates quantum events. → The article correctly notes it "doesn't prove" the mechanism, only defeats the objection.
- **Falsifiability concern**: No empirical test proposed. → Deferred; this is a conceptual clarification article, not an empirical proposal.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening paragraph: Clear, confident statement of the problem and solution structure
- Response 1: The "universe coordinates more impressive things" argument is genuinely strong
- "Objection proves too much" framing in Relation to Site Perspective
- Response 3: Creative use of simulation hypothesis to dissolve locality concerns

### Enhancements Made
- Added opening pointer to interface-locality.md and brain-specialness.md for readers seeking more detail
- Expanded Response 2 with pairing problem context and brain-specialness reference
- Enhanced binding problem section with entanglement observation
- Added quantum entanglement as potential mechanism for coordination (not just tolerance of it)
- Expanded Further Reading from 3 to 7 entries
- Added Kim's work to References

### Cross-links Added
- [[interface-locality]]
- [[brain-specialness]]
- [[pairing-problem]]
- [[binding-problem]]
- [[quantum-consciousness]]
- [[interactionist-dualism]]
- [[decoherence]]

## Remaining Items

None. All critical and medium issues addressed. The article now properly connects to the site's more developed treatments of related problems and serves as an appropriate introduction to the locality concern.
