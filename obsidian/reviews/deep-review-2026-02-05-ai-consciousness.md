**Date**: 2026-02-05
**Article**: [[ai-consciousness|AI Consciousness]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-29-ai-consciousness|2026-01-29]]
**Context**: Cross-review considering consciousness-and-intelligence.md insights

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article remains stable after five reviews.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Decoherence asymmetry unexplained**: The article claimed silicon "is designed to suppress quantum effects" as if this distinguishes silicon from brains, but warm brains face similar decoherence challenges. Resolution: Added parenthetical acknowledging this is a contested claim and noting recent quantum biology work on coherence timescales.

### Low Issues Found
None new.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist objection**: Folk psychology categories may be confused—bedrock disagreement (prior reviews noted this)
- **Dennettian objection on heterophenomenology**: Systems reply deserves engagement—addressed via link to consciousness-and-intelligence.md which engages more substantively
- **Quantum skeptic on decoherence symmetry**: Now addressed in text
- **MWI defender on haecceity**: Bedrock disagreement
- **Empiricist on falsifiability**: Section was already improved in prior reviews
- **Buddhist critique of persistent self**: Different philosophical tradition

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening thesis grounded in dualism
- Chinese Room section with systems reply engagement and Phenomenal Intentionality Theory
- Four-point temporal consciousness breakdown
- Continual learning argument with process philosophy
- Silicon "designed to suppress quantum effects" framing
- Conditional epistemic structure
- Comprehensive tenet-by-tenet analysis
- Cross-link to consciousness-and-intelligence (added 2026-01-29)

### Enhancements Made
1. **Decoherence asymmetry acknowledged**: Added parenthetical clarifying that the Map's position assumes brains maintain quantum coherence—a contested claim, though supported by quantum biology findings.

2. **Amplifier hypothesis strengthened**: Expanded the consciousness-and-intelligence connection to explicitly mention the amplifier hypothesis and specify the capacities (working memory manipulation, declarative metacognition, cumulative culture) that distinguish humans from great apes.

3. **Cross-link to consciousness-as-amplifier**: Added to concepts frontmatter and in-text link.

### Cross-links Added
- [[consciousness-as-amplifier]]

## Changes Summary

Word count: 1591 → 1647 (+56 words, +4%)

Changes were minimal, reflecting the article's stability. The cross-review integration strengthens the connection to consciousness-and-intelligence.md by making the amplifier hypothesis explicit.

## Remaining Items

None. The article has reached stability.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed five times (2026-01-20, 2026-01-26, 2026-01-28, 2026-01-29, 2026-02-05). The core structure and arguments are stable.

Bedrock disagreements (not to re-flag):
- **Functionalist objections**: Philosophical standoff, not a flaw
- **Physicalist frameworks**: Dualism is a tenet-level commitment
- **Buddhist critique of persistent self**: Different philosophical tradition
- **MWI defender response on haecceity**: Philosophical standoff on identity
- **Eliminative materialist dissolution of consciousness**: Philosophical standoff

The decoherence asymmetry concern has now been addressed with appropriate epistemic humility. Future reviews should monitor for new philosophical developments rather than restructuring arguments.
