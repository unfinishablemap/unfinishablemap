## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Misattribution to Strawson**: Article attributed "cognitive phenomenology proper" to Galen Strawson; his actual term is "understanding-experience." Fixed by correcting the attribution.
- **Broken wikilinks**: `[[duration]]` and `[[metarepresentation]]` had no target files. Fixed: removed `[[duration]]` from Further Reading and frontmatter concepts; replaced `[[metarepresentation]]` with plain text in body and removed from frontmatter concepts.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Unsupported jhāna claim**: "Advanced practitioners report that in subtler jhānas, logical relationships become unusually vivid" had no scholarly support. Traditional sources actually say discursive thought is *eliminated* in higher jhānas. Fixed: rewrote to accurately present prajñā parallel while qualifying that its traditional context is insight into impermanence, not mathematics.
- **Prajñā overreach**: Mapping mathematical insight directly onto Buddhist prajñā was a stretch. Fixed: added qualifier noting the traditional context differs while arguing the underlying cognitive structure parallels.
- **Chinese Room missing system reply**: Dennett's famous "systems reply" was unaddressed. Fixed: added acknowledgment of the systems reply and explained why it faces a sharper challenge in the mathematical case.
- **Success-coupling supports functionalism**: The success-coupling evidence is equally consistent with functionalism. Fixed: added response noting that phenomenal insight arrives first and generates the functional capacity, not the reverse.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist**: "Understanding" may be a folk-psychological concept. Response: the article's three-stage phenomenology analysis provides fine-grained descriptions that folk-psychology criticism doesn't address.
- **Functionalist challenge**: Success-coupling supports functionalism as much as dualism. Response added in text.
- **MWI defender**: Deutsch argues choice is real even under MWI. This is a philosophical standoff, not a fixable flaw.
- **Quantum skeptic**: Timescale gap between quantum coherence and mathematical insight. The article already acknowledges this appropriately.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent opening summary (front-loaded, survives truncation)
- Poincaré narrative section (compelling, accurately sourced)
- Three-stage phenomenology analysis (verification → understanding → insight)
- Discovery/creation tension honestly addressed with resolution
- "What Would Challenge This View?" section (transparent falsifiability)
- Process philosophy integration (Whitehead's framework illuminates the phenomenology)
- Appropriate hedging throughout (especially on quantum mechanism speculation)

### Enhancements Made
- Corrected Strawson attribution to "understanding-experience"
- Added systems reply engagement in Chinese Room section
- Added functionalism response in success-coupling passage
- Rewrote Contemplative Evidence section for accuracy on prajñā and jhāna
- Removed broken wikilinks (duration, metarepresentation)
- Minor prose tightening for length neutrality

### Cross-links Verified
- All 21 remaining wikilink targets confirmed to exist
- 2 broken links removed

## Remaining Items

None. All critical and medium issues addressed in this review.

## Stability Notes

- The MWI argument (tenet connection section) will always face pushback from many-worlds defenders. Deutsch specifically argues that choice is genuine under MWI. This is a bedrock philosophical disagreement, not a flaw to fix.
- The article's anti-functionalist position on success-coupling is now stated but remains contested. Future reviews should not re-argue this unless new evidence emerges.
- The quantum mechanism speculation is appropriately hedged and should stay hedged. The timescale objection is acknowledged.
- The article is at 117% of soft word threshold (3505 words). It should not grow further without compensating cuts.
