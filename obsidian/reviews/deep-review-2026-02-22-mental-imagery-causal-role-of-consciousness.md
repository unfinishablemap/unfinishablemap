**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Broken link**: `[[consciousness-independent-baseline-cognition|baseline cognition]]` pointed to a non-existent page. Fixed to `[[baseline-cognition|baseline cognition]]` (the actual concept page).

### Medium Issues Found
- **Content Matching argument conflation** (Breaking the Standoff § Content Matching): The original text assumed first-person perspective imagery involves "richer phenomenal engagement" without justification. Tightened to acknowledge the physicalist counter (perspective differences may reflect different motor circuits) while noting the consistent correlation between phenomenological richness and outcome strength. Resolution: rewrote passage to present the argument more carefully and include the physicalist response.
- **Missing cross-links**: Article was completely orphaned with zero inbound links despite being relevant to many articles across the site. Resolution: added inbound links from 7 related articles.
- **Missing Further Reading entries**: No links to consciousness-and-skilled-performance or consciousness-and-causal-powers despite direct relevance. Resolution: added both.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative Materialist**: The voluntary/involuntary dissociation is simply a neural circuit difference (LPFC vs non-LPFC), not evidence for consciousness. The article already acknowledges this standoff fairly.
- **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: Content matching could reflect motor circuit differences rather than phenomenal differences. Addressed by tightening the argument.
- **Empiricist**: Aphantasia prediction is preliminary. The article already hedges appropriately with "preliminary evidence" and "if confirmed with larger samples."
- **Quantum Skeptic**: Quantum mechanisms mentioned only once in passing, appropriately hedged. No issues.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent opening summary that front-loads the core question and the Map's position
- "What Imagery Doesn't Prove" section demonstrates intellectual honesty that strengthens credibility
- Self-stultification argument applied specifically to imagery reports is well-executed and original
- The voluntary/involuntary dissociation is presented as the strongest evidence, correctly
- Three-feature argument (observable voluntariness, measurable effects, natural control condition) is effective and novel
- Appropriate restraint on quantum mechanisms—mentioned once without dominating

### Enhancements Made
- Tightened Content Matching argument to engage physicalist response directly
- Added 2 new Further Reading entries connecting to related topics
- Fixed broken internal link
- Integrated article into site navigation through 7 new inbound cross-links

## Remaining Items

None. The article is well-constructed with appropriate epistemic calibration. All critical and medium issues have been addressed.

## Stability Notes

The article's core argument—that mental imagery provides a distinctive test case for consciousness's causal role without definitively proving it—is correctly calibrated. The explanatory standoff between interactionist and neural-sufficiency accounts is a bedrock philosophical disagreement, not a flaw to fix. Future reviews should not re-flag the standoff as a critical issue.

The aphantasia prediction is explicitly flagged as preliminary. If future research confirms or disconfirms it, the article should be updated accordingly, but its current hedging is appropriate.
