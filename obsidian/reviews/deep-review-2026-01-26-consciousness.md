**Date**: 2026-01-26
**Article**: [[consciousness|Consciousness]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Missing citation**: Lieberman et al. (2008) referenced in text but not in References section. **Resolution**: Added full citation.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Illusionism response too thin**: Original text dismissed illusionism in one sentence without engaging Frankish's positive account. **Resolution**: Expanded to explain the illusion problem and why the Map's objection (seemings have experiential character) targets the core issue.
- **Convergence claim unqualified**: Arguments presented as "jointly establishing" irreducibility without acknowledging physicalist responses. **Resolution**: Added acknowledgment that physicalists have responses while explaining why convergence strengthens the cumulative case.

### Low Issues Found
- Self section thin (appropriate for hub article—no change needed)
- Quantum mechanism speculation could be more explicitly flagged (already appropriately restrained)
- MWI response stated rather than defended (bedrock disagreement—no change needed)

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Zombie conceivability disputed**: Acknowledged in added text about physicalist responses
- **Illusionism's positive program**: Now engaged with Frankish's account directly

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent front-loaded opening summary (survives truncation)
- Clear three-part characterization (subjectivity, qualitative character, unity)
- Well-structured phenomenal/access distinction
- Appropriate restraint on quantum mechanisms
- Comprehensive "Relation to Site Perspective" connecting all five tenets
- Hub structure with extensive cross-linking

### Enhancements Made
- Added mysterianism as a theory (with connection to Occam's Razor Has Limits tenet)
- Expanded illusionism section to engage with Frankish's positive account
- Added acknowledgment of physicalist responses to irreducibility arguments
- Added McGinn reference to support mysterianism addition

### Cross-links Added
- [[mysterianism]] (concepts)
- [[panpsychism]] (concepts)
- [[mysterianism]] (Further Reading)

## Word Count

- Before: 1974 words (79% of 2500 soft threshold)
- After: 2211 words (88% of 2500 soft threshold)
- Change: +237 words

## Remaining Items

None. All critical and medium issues addressed.

## Stability Notes

This article is a hub page synthesizing the Map's treatment of consciousness across many specific concept pages. Future reviews should focus on:
1. Ensuring cross-links remain current as new consciousness-related articles are added
2. Checking that summarized positions match the detailed treatments in linked articles

Philosophical disagreements (e.g., MWI defenders finding indexical arguments unsatisfying, eliminativists rejecting phenomenal consciousness as a category) represent bedrock commitments rather than flaws to fix.
