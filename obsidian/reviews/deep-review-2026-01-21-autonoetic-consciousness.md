## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
1. **Typo "siteion"** → Fixed to "projection" (line 58)

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Illusionist section lacked Frankish specificity** → Added ~300 words on quasi-phenomenal properties, zombie reformulation, and the regress applied specifically to Frankish's framework
2. **Buddhist contemplative evidence was thin** → Added ~200 words on sati practice, jhāna contrast, and Abhidharma analysis of sañña and cetasika
3. **No Many Worlds argument underdeveloped** → Added ~150 words addressing the MWI defender's "coherent within branch" response with indexical identity argument
4. **Missing cross-links** → Added phenomenology-of-choice and consciousness-as-amplifier to concepts and Further Reading

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Quasi-phenomenal pastness**: Addressed with zombie reformulation—quasi-phenomenal properties require phenomenal grounding
- **Branch-coherent identity**: Addressed with singular identity argument—autonoetic re-experiencing presupposes *the* person, not *a* person
- **Remember/know as functional marker**: Addressed by noting the robustness of phenomenal discrimination suggests real difference

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening paragraph's vivid capture of autonoetic phenomenology
- Double presence structure explanation
- Tulving's framework integration
- Reid's objection reframe
- All five tenet connections in Relation to Site Perspective

### Enhancements Made
1. **Frankish's Quasi-Phenomenal Response** subsection (~300 words)
2. **Buddhist phenomenology expansion** with technical vocabulary (sati, jhāna, sañña, cetasika) (~200 words)
3. **Strengthened No Many Worlds** with indexical identity response (~150 words)
4. **Convergence with Buddhist Mind-Moments** subsection connecting Whitehead and Abhidharma (~250 words)
5. **Remember/know paradigm** expanded as evidence against illusionism (~100 words)

### Cross-links Added
- [[phenomenology-of-choice]] — Added to concepts and Further Reading
- [[consciousness-as-amplifier]] — Added to concepts and Further Reading
