# Deep Review: Predictive Processing

**Date**: 2026-01-20
**File**: obsidian/concepts/predictive-processing.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Missing illusionist engagement**: PP has strong affinities with illusionism that weren't addressed. Resolution: Added comprehensive "The Illusionist Challenge" section with four responses (regress problem, introspection survives debunking, contemplative challenge, functional asymmetry).
- **No falsifiability section**: Article presented PP as influential without addressing what could challenge it. Resolution: Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section with 5 specific conditions.
- **Missing contemplative evidence**: No engagement with meditation traditions' data on predictive processes. Resolution: Added "Contemplative Evidence" section covering real-time observation, precision modulation, witness consciousness, and cessation states.
- **Incomplete tenet coverage**: Only 3 of 5 tenets addressed, superficially. Resolution: Expanded "Relation to Site Perspective" to substantively cover all 5 tenets including decoherence challenge.

### Medium Issues Found
- **No Process Philosophy perspective**: Missing Whitehead connection. Resolution: Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section connecting PP to prehension, concrescence, and eternal objects.
- **Missing decoherence acknowledgment**: Quantum claims made without addressing decoherence objection. Resolution: Added decoherence challenge subsection within tenet coverage.
- **Haecceity not addressed**: No Many Worlds tenet connection was absent. Resolution: Added substantive No Many Worlds section explaining why PP presupposes collapse and indexical identity.

### Counterarguments Considered
- Eliminativist view that PP explains everything about consciousness (addressed via regress problem)
- Illusionist interpretation of "controlled hallucination" (addressed with four responses)
- Quantum skepticism about biological coherence (addressed with decoherence section)
- Process philosophy critique of experience-less computation (addressed with Whitehead section)

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent opening summary that front-loads the key point about functionalist limitation
- Clear Hohwy vs Clark distinction
- Strong dreams section with lucid dreaming evidence (Demirel 2025)
- Well-structured Further Reading section
- Good honest assessment of PP's limitations

### Enhancements Made
- Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section (4 responses)
- Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section (prehension, concrescence, eternal objects)
- Added "Contemplative Evidence" section (4 subsections)
- Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section (5 falsifiability conditions)
- Expanded "Relation to Site Perspective" from ~250 words to ~650 words covering all 5 tenets
- Added decoherence challenge with 3-part response

### Cross-links Added
- [[illusionism]]
- [[introspection]]
- [[witness-consciousness]]
- [[attention-as-interface]]
- [[decoherence]]
- [[haecceity]]
- [[many-worlds]]
- [[meditation-and-consciousness-modes]]

### References Added

## Remaining Items

None. All critical and medium issues addressed. The article now provides comprehensive engagement with PP from the Map's dualist perspective, including challenges, contemplative evidence, process philosophy, and falsifiability conditions.
