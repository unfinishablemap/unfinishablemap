# Tenet Alignment Check

**Date**: 2026-02-15
**Files checked**: 310 (128 topics + 182 concepts)
**Errors**: 0
**Warnings**: 0
**Notes**: 0

## Summary

All 310 content files across `topics/` and `concepts/` align with the five foundational tenets. No genuine violations were found. Every file either directly supports the Map's interactionist-dualist framework or discusses opposing views explicitly in order to argue against them. No file endorses or implicitly assumes a tenet-violating position.

The analysis was conducted by reading all files in both sections and checking for direct contradictions, implicit assumptions conflicting with tenets, and tensions requiring clarification. Since the last check (2026-02-11, 280 files), 30 new files have been added — all align with tenet commitments.

## Tenet Compliance by Category

### 1. Dualism ✓

All files treat consciousness as irreducible to physical processes. Files discussing rival positions do so to critique them:

- `illusionism.md` presents and systematically rejects illusionism
- `materialism.md` presents and rejects materialism with detailed arguments
- `heterophenomenology.md` explicitly rejects Dennett's method as eliminativist
- `higher-order-theories.md` critiques HOT from the Map's perspective
- `reductionism.md` argues consciousness resists reduction
- `russellian-monism.md` discusses Russellian monism as a middle path but explicitly prefers interactionist dualism
- `substrate-independence.md` rejects substrate independence through converging arguments
- `panpsychism.md` discusses panpsychism sympathetically but ultimately prefers interactionist dualism
- `phenomenal-concepts-strategy.md` argues the PCS fails, supporting the reality of the explanatory gap
- `pain-asymbolia.md` (new) uses clinical dissociation as evidence for irreducible phenomenal qualities
- `philosophical-zombies.md` uses the conceivability argument as core support for dualism
- `qualia.md` presents qualia as the central datum supporting dualism
- `symbol-grounding-problem.md` argues intrinsic meaning requires consciousness
- `categorical-surprise.md` (new) grounds category-violating surprise in irreducible phenomenal properties

### 2. Minimal Quantum Interaction ✓

No endorsement of quantum mysticism or uncontrolled psychokinesis. All quantum mechanism references maintain appropriate constraints:

- `quantum-consciousness.md` surveys Orch OR, Stapp, and Fisher mechanisms with appropriate caveats
- `quantum-interpretations.md` favours time-symmetric collapse over MWI
- `stapp-quantum-mind.md` frames the quantum Zeno mechanism as attentional bias, not energy injection
- `motor-selection.md` describes quantum Zeno effect as attentional stabilisation, not energy injection
- `mind-matter-interface.md` implements two-layer architecture with minimal influence at quantum indeterminacies
- `measurement-problem.md` carefully positions consciousness-based collapse as one interpretation among several
- `observational-closure.md` uses Saad's distinction to show interactionism need not be empirically detectable
- `spontaneous-collapse-theories.md` correctly notes Orch OR conflicts with MQI while identifying CSL-IIT hybrid as more aligned
- `timing-gap-problem.md` honestly addresses the 12-order-of-magnitude timing gap as the Map's most important empirical challenge

### 3. Bidirectional Interaction ✓

All files support consciousness as causally efficacious. No file treats consciousness as epiphenomenal:

- `mental-causation.md` provides the core argument for mental states causing physical effects
- `self-stultification.md` argues epiphenomenalism is self-defeating
- `neuroplasticity.md` uses Schwartz's OCD research as evidence for consciousness-driven neural change
- `libet-experiments.md` defends conscious causation against Libet-based epiphenomenalism
- `objections-to-interactionism.md` responds to six major objections while defending causal efficacy
- `selection-laws.md` provides the core framework for downward psychophysical laws
- `substance-causation.md` provides Lowe's metaphysical foundation for bidirectional interaction
- `evolutionary-case-for-mental-causation.md` argues consciousness contributes to fitness
- `choking-phenomenon-mental-causation.md` uses expertise breakdown as evidence for mental causation
- `placebo-effect-and-mental-causation.md` uses placebo effects as evidence for mental causation

### 4. No Many Worlds ✓

Every mention of many-worlds interpretation occurs in contexts that reject it:

- `many-worlds.md` explicitly rejects MWI with five distinct arguments
- `quantum-interpretations.md` rejects MWI on five grounds and favours time-symmetric collapse
- `measurement-problem.md` labels MWI as "directly rejected"
- `indexical-identity-quantum-measurement.md` uses indexical identity to argue against MWI
- `indexical-knowledge-and-identity.md` argues indexical identity poses insoluble problems for branching
- `vertiginous-question.md` uses the vertiginous question to motivate collapse over branching
- `retrocausality.md` resolves the Libet problem via backward causation, presupposing collapse
- `temporal-unity.md` supports No Many Worlds through retention from a definite past

### 5. Occam's Razor Has Limits ✓

No file uses parsimony as a decisive argument against dualism:

- `mysterianism.md` argues cognitive closure limits conceptual tools
- `methodological-pluralism.md` argues multiple methods are needed
- `phenomenal-intentionality.md` argues functional parsimony omits phenomenal reality
- `knowledge-argument.md` uses the Jackson argument to show physical completeness claims are premature
- `specious-present.md` argues experienced duration resists reductive explanation
- `timing-gap-problem.md` openly acknowledges the Map's biggest empirical challenge rather than hiding behind simplicity

## Structural Patterns Supporting Alignment

The content architecture includes features ensuring tenet compliance:

1. **"Relation to Site Perspective" sections**: The vast majority of files conclude with explicit discussion linking their content to specific tenets via anchor links
2. **"What Would Challenge This View?" sections**: Many files include honest self-criticism sections showing the Map engages with potential defeaters
3. **Steel-manning before critique**: Files on opposing views explain positions thoroughly before systematic objections
4. **Calibrated confidence**: Several files acknowledge evidential limitations honestly rather than overclaiming
5. **Consistent framing language**: "Illusionists claim..." / "Epiphenomenalists hold..." / "The materialist argues..." followed by systematic objections

## New Files Since Last Check (2026-02-11)

30 new files have been added since the last tenet check. All align with tenets:

- New concept files include `pain-asymbolia.md`, `categorical-surprise.md`, `protention.md`, and others
- New topic files include several phenomenology articles and research-driven expansions
- All new files include proper "Relation to Site Perspective" sections

## Conclusion

All 310 files demonstrate consistent philosophical commitment to the dualist, interactionist framework defined in the tenets while engaging fairly and comprehensively with opposing positions. No corrections needed.
