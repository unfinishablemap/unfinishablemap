**Date**: 2026-02-01
**Article**: [[causal-closure|Causal Closure of the Physical]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-29-causal-closure|2026-01-29]]
**Cross-review context**: conservation-laws-and-mind.md insights

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The article has been reviewed three times previously (2026-01-20, 2026-01-22, 2026-01-29) and has reached stability.

### Medium Issues Found and Addressed

1. **Missing Noether's theorem detail**: The conservation objection response referenced Pitts and Cucu's work on conservation being "local and conditional" but didn't explain *why* conservation is conditional—namely that Noether's theorem derives conservation from symmetries, and external influences break those symmetries.
   - **Resolution**: Added explicit mention of Noether's theorem and the question-begging nature of the objection in the conservation laws paragraph.

### Low Issues

None identified.

### Counterarguments Considered

The six adversarial personas found no new issues. The article already addresses:
- Hidden variable theories (Bohmian mechanics response)
- Overdetermination via delegation and complementary determination
- Decoherence challenge with three-part response
- MWI rejection with indexical identity reasoning
- Testability with four falsification criteria

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- **Comprehensive treatment**: Covers formulation dilemma, exclusion argument, quantum exception, emergentist response, arguments from reason, and free will connections
- **Saad's observational vs universal closure distinction**: Key insight from 2025 paper well integrated
- **Delegatory dualism integration**: Previous review added substantive connection to preemption framework
- **Stapp's quantum Zeno framework**: Four-feature treatment is detailed and defensible
- **Chess analogy**: Effective for explaining complementary determination
- **Testability section**: Four explicit falsification criteria demonstrates scientific attitude

### Enhancements Made

1. **Noether's theorem integration**: Strengthened the conservation objection response by explaining that conservation arises from symmetries (Noether's theorem), making explicit why external influences break conservation's preconditions.

2. **Question-begging clarified**: Added note that the conservation objection "begs the question by assuming no such influences exist."

### Cross-links Verified

- `[[conservation-laws-and-mind]]` — inline reference and Further Reading entry both present
- `[[delegatory-dualism]]` — integrated in overdetermination response and Further Reading

## Remaining Items

None. The article is comprehensive and well-integrated with related content.

## Stability Notes

This is the fourth deep review. The article has reached high stability:

- **Materialist persona objections**: Expected philosophical standoff, not a flaw. The article presents dualist responses; materialists will remain unconvinced.
- **Quantum skeptic concerns**: Decoherence timescales acknowledged as empirically uncertain. Article is honest about this.
- **MWI defender objections**: Article notes that rejecting MWI (Tenet 4) does crucial work. This is a bedrock Map commitment.
- **Conservation objection**: Now fully addresses the Noether's theorem basis, making the "conditional" claim rigorous.

Future reviews should NOT re-flag these as critical unless new content reintroduces problems.
