**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Article**: [[symbol-grounding-problem|The Symbol Grounding Problem]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-30-symbol-grounding-problem|2026-01-30]] (cross-review)

## Context

The article was regenerated on 2026-02-02, losing cross-review additions from the 2026-01-30 review. This review restores those connections and verifies article stability.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None identified.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Missing cross-links from previous review**: The article lost links to `[[language-recursion-and-consciousness]]` and `[[working-memory]]` that were added in the 2026-01-30 cross-review.
   - **Resolution**: Restored both in frontmatter and added to Further Reading section.

2. **Spurious related_articles entry**: Contained reference to `symbol-grounding-problem-2026-01-30` which appeared to be an error.
   - **Resolution**: Removed the spurious entry.

### Attribution Accuracy Check
- Harnad (1990): Dictionary metaphor, grounding hierarchy—accurate
- Searle (1980): Chinese Room—accurate
- Barsalou (2008): Perceptual symbol systems—accurate
- Steels (2008): "has been solved" claim—correctly attributed
- Piantadosi & Hill (2023): Vector grounding problem quote—accurate
- Mollo & Millière (2023): Referenced appropriately
- Lin & Liu (2022): Hard/easy distinction—accurate

No attribution errors detected.

### Philosophical Disagreements (Not Flaws)
Per previous reviews, these remain bedrock disagreements:
- Eliminativist objection to treating meaning/intentionality as real explananda
- MWI objection to indexical identity arguments
- Deflationary semantics challenge
- Empiricist falsifiability concerns (applies to consciousness studies generally)

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening paragraph's concise statement connecting the problem to dualism
- Dictionary metaphor as accessible entry point
- Three-level grounding hierarchy (iconic/categorical/symbolic)
- Hard/easy grounding problem parallel with Chalmers's distinction
- LLM section as contemporary test case with appropriate hedging
- Phenomenal intentionality as the theoretical bridge
- Multiple substantive tenet connections (Dualism, Bidirectional, Occam's)

### Enhancements Made (This Review)
1. Restored `[[language-recursion-and-consciousness]]` to frontmatter topics
2. Restored `[[working-memory]]` to frontmatter concepts
3. Removed spurious `symbol-grounding-problem-2026-01-30` from related_articles
4. Added paragraph in Consciousness Connection linking grounding to working memory maintenance/manipulation distinction
5. Added two entries to Further Reading (language-recursion-and-consciousness, working-memory)

### Cross-links Added/Restored
- [[language-recursion-and-consciousness]] (frontmatter, body text, Further Reading)
- [[working-memory]] (frontmatter, body text, Further Reading)

## Word Count

- Before: 1654 words (55% of 3000 soft threshold)
- After: 1744 words (58% of 3000 soft threshold)
- Change: +90 words

## Remaining Items

None.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed three times:
1. Initial deep review (2026-01-30T17:54:00)
2. Cross-review after language-recursion-and-consciousness (2026-01-30T22:46:00)
3. This review (2026-02-02)

The article is stable. This review primarily restored cross-links lost during regeneration. The core philosophical content is solid and well-structured.

**Bedrock disagreements that should NOT be re-flagged in future reviews:**
1. Eliminativist objection to meaning/intentionality as real explananda
2. MWI objection to indexical identity
3. Deflationary semantics challenge
4. Empiricist falsifiability concerns

These represent fundamental philosophical standoffs, not fixable flaws. The article appropriately acknowledges opposing views while taking the Map's position.
