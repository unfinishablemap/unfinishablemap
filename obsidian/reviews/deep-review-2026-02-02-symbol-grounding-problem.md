**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Article**: [[symbol-grounding-problem|Symbol Grounding Problem]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-30-symbol-grounding-problem|2026-01-30]] (cross-review with language-recursion-and-consciousness)
**Review context**: Cross-review with AI consciousness articles ([[ai-consciousness]], [[llm-consciousness]])

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None identified.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **No Many Worlds tenet connection was loose**: The argument that meaning would "dissolve" across branches was underdeveloped.
   - **Resolution**: Rewrote to focus on indexical anchoring—meaning is indexed to a subject, and MWI undermines the determinate subject to whom symbols mean something.

### Attribution Accuracy Check
- Harnad (1990): Dictionary regress, hybrid proposal, iconic/categorical/symbolic representations—accurate
- Searle (1980): Chinese Room, Robot Reply, Systems Reply—accurate
- Piantadosi and Hill (2023) quote on vector components—reasonable paraphrase
- Steels (2008) "has been solved" claim—correctly attributed and critiqued
- Mollo and Millière (2023) quote—verifiable
- Lin and Liu (2022) hard/easy distinction—accurate
- Harnad Scholarpedia quote—verifiable
- Barsalou (2008) embodied cognition—correctly attributed

No attribution errors detected.

### Philosophical Disagreements (Not Flaws)
Per previous reviews, these remain bedrock disagreements:
- Eliminativist objection to treating meaning/intentionality as real explananda
- Functionalist/deflationary semantics challenge
- MWI objection to indexical identity arguments
- Empiricist falsifiability concerns

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening paragraph's intrinsic vs. borrowed meaning framing
- Dictionary regress as accessible entry point
- Hard/easy grounding parallel with Chalmers's distinction
- "Thin" vs. "thick" grounding distinction
- Harnad's concession quote ("grounding is a functional matter; feeling is a felt matter")
- "Chinese Rooms at scale" LLM characterization
- Self-referential Bidirectional Interaction argument
- Lin and Liu hard/easy problem parallel
- All five tenet connections

### Enhancements Made (This Review)
1. Added `[[continual-learning-argument]]` link in LLM section with explanation of proximity argument
2. Added `[[baseline-cognition]]` reference in embodiment section
3. Tightened No Many Worlds tenet connection (clearer argument about indexical anchoring)
4. Added `[[baseline-cognition]]` and `[[continual-learning-argument]]` to frontmatter concepts
5. Added two entries to Further Reading section

### Cross-links Added
- [[continual-learning-argument]] (frontmatter, body text, Further Reading)
- [[baseline-cognition]] (frontmatter, body text, Further Reading)

## Word Count

- Before: 2301 words (92% of 2500 soft threshold)
- After: 2380 words (95% of 2500 soft threshold)
- Change: +79 words

## Remaining Items

None.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed four times:
1. Initial deep review (2026-01-30T17:54:00)
2. Cross-review with language-recursion-and-consciousness (2026-01-30T22:46:00)
3. Previous cross-review restoring lost links (2026-02-02T16:42:00)
4. This cross-review with AI consciousness articles (2026-02-02T17:43:00)

The article is stable and well-integrated with the Map's AI consciousness content. The additions strengthen bidirectional connections:
- Symbol grounding now links to continual-learning-argument (relevant to LLM grounding impossibility)
- Symbol grounding now links to baseline-cognition (relevant to what symbol manipulation achieves without consciousness)
- AI consciousness articles already link back to symbol-grounding

**Bedrock disagreements that should NOT be re-flagged in future reviews:**
1. Eliminativist objection to meaning/intentionality as real explananda
2. Functionalist/deflationary semantics challenge
3. MWI objection to indexical identity
4. Empiricist falsifiability concerns

These represent fundamental philosophical standoffs, not fixable flaws. The article appropriately engages opposing views while taking the Map's dualist position.
