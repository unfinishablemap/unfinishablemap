# Deep Review: The Explanatory Gap

**Date**: 2026-01-20
**File**: obsidian/concepts/explanatory-gap.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Missing substantive illusionist engagement**: The original illusionism section was brief and didn't address the strongest version of the objection—that the gap is between physics and our *misconceptions* about phenomenal properties.
   - **Resolution**: Expanded illusionism section to distinguish hard and soft versions, and added the regress argument showing that "seeming phenomenal" itself requires phenomenality.

2. **No falsifiability conditions**: The article lacked criteria for what would close or weaken the gap argument.
   - **Resolution**: Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section with five testable conditions.

3. **Missing mysterianism connection**: Colin McGinn's cognitive closure argument is directly relevant but wasn't mentioned.
   - **Resolution**: Added "The Mysterian Alternative" subsection explaining cognitive closure and The Unfinishable Map's response.

4. **Missing process philosophy perspective**: Alternative frameworks that might reframe the gap weren't considered.
   - **Resolution**: Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section presenting Whitehead's actual occasions as an alternative framing.

### Medium Issues Found

- **Tenet section incomplete**: Only addressed Dualism, Minimal Quantum Interaction, and Occam's Razor Has Limits.
  - **Resolution**: Expanded to address all five tenets explicitly, including Bidirectional Interaction and No Many Worlds.

- **Missing introspection connection**: How we know about the gap wasn't discussed.
  - **Resolution**: Added "The Introspection Question" subsection addressing reliability concerns.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Illusionist regress**: If phenomenality is an illusion, the seeming itself requires explanation
- **Cognitive closure**: The gap might reflect human limitation rather than ontological fact
- **Process philosophy reframing**: The gap exists because we ask the question backwards

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Clear opening summary with front-loaded key claim about the conceptual chasm
- Excellent C-fiber firing/water molecule comparison illustrating what's missing
- Well-structured thought experiments section (Mary's Room, zombies, inverted qualia)
- Strong progression from Levine's epistemic reading to Chalmers' ontological development
- Effective convergence argument (multiple independent arguments → increased confidence)

### Enhancements Made

1. Expanded illusionism section with Frankish/Dennett and regress response
2. Added mysterianism subsection with cognitive closure discussion
3. Added introspection subsection addressing reliability concerns
4. Added process philosophy perspective (Whitehead's actual occasions)
5. Added "What Would Challenge This View?" falsifiability section
6. Expanded tenet connections to address all five tenets
7. Added 4 new cross-links to frontmatter and Further Reading
8. Added 4 new references (Frankish, McGinn, Strawson, Whitehead)

### Cross-links Added

- [[illusionism]] (deepened existing link)
- [[mysterianism]]
- [[introspection]]
- [[integrated-information-theory]]

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues were addressed in this review.
