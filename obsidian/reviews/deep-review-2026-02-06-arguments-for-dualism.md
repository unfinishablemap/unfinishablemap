**Date**: 2026-02-06
**Article**: [[arguments-for-dualism|Arguments for Dualism]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-27-arguments-for-dualism|2026-01-27]]

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Broken tenet anchor links (2 instances)**: `[[tenets#^occam|...]]` used but the actual anchor in tenets.md is `^occams-limits`. Fixed to `[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]` in both the Parsimony Objection section and Relation to Site Perspective.
- **PhilPapers survey statistic conflation**: Article stated "22% accept dualism—second only to materialism (51%)" but the 22% comes from the consciousness question (where functionalism leads at 33%) while 51% comes from a different question (mind: physicalism vs non-physicalism). Fixed to cite numbers from the same question: "22%... second only to functionalism (33%)."

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing cross-reference to new Occam's Razor article**: The parsimony section made no reference to the newly published `epistemological-limits-of-occams-razor.md` which provides comprehensive philosophical treatment of why parsimony fails against dualism. Added cross-references in three locations: Parsimony Objection section, Relation to Site Perspective, and Further Reading.
- **Style guide: "this page" instead of "this article"**: Fixed on line 44.
- **Style guide: "above"/"below" spatial references**: Replaced with explicit section references (3 instances).
- **Missing references for cited researchers**: Bloom (2004), Barrett et al. (2021), Barlev & Shtulman (2021) were cited with specific years and claims but had no References entries. Added all three, plus Huemer (2009), Sober (2001), and Zanotti (2021) which are now cited in the revised parsimony section.

### Counterarguments Considered
All major counterarguments were already addressed in previous reviews. No new counterarguments required engagement. The parsimony section was strengthened by referencing the new dedicated article rather than requiring new argumentative content.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear convergence structure across seven independent arguments
- Effective numbered-premise format (used for conceivability, knowledge, unity, modal arguments)
- Strong Illusionist Challenge section with three counter-arguments (regress, self-undermining, Moorean)
- Excellent falsifiability conditions showing responsiveness to evidence
- Comprehensive tenet integration in Relation to Site Perspective

### Enhancements Made
- Substantially upgraded parsimony section to reference Huemer, Sober, and Zanotti's independent philosophical analyses, with link to new dedicated article
- Added `[[epistemological-limits-of-occams-razor]]` to frontmatter related_articles, Parsimony Objection section, Relation to Site Perspective, and Further Reading
- Added 7 missing references for citation integrity (Barlev & Shtulman, Barrett et al., Bloom, Huemer, Sober, Zanotti; removed duplicate Bourget & Chalmers reordering)
- Tightened prose in conservation laws response, exclusion argument response, post-objections summary, process philosophy section, and illusionist concluding paragraph to offset additions

### Cross-links Added
- [[epistemological-limits-of-occams-razor]] — Added in 4 locations (frontmatter, parsimony section, Relation to Site Perspective, Further Reading)

## Remaining Items

None. The article continues to be in a stable, converged state. The primary work in this review was integrating cross-references to the new Occam's Razor article and fixing the two critical issues (broken anchors and survey statistics).

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed three times. It remains at convergence on its core arguments. The following bedrock disagreements from the previous review still apply:

- **Materialist/functionalist objections**: Philosophical standoffs about qualia, "what it's like," and introspection are expected and not fixable.
- **Quantum mechanism skepticism**: The quantum interaction framework is a deliberate site-wide position, not a flaw in this article.
- **MWI proponents**: The indexical identity argument will not satisfy MWI defenders. Acknowledged in falsifiability condition 5.
- **Unity of consciousness and the no-self critique**: The Buddhist challenge that "unity" might be a construction rather than a datum is a genuine philosophical tension but the article presents multiple independent arguments, so no single argument's weakness is fatal.

Future reviews should focus on: (1) ensuring cross-references to newly created articles remain current, (2) checking that survey data citations remain accurate as new PhilPapers surveys are published. The philosophical substance has reached stability.

## Word Count

Before: 3258 words (130% of soft threshold)
After: 3407 words (136% of soft threshold, under 3500 hard threshold)
Change: +149 words (net increase is almost entirely from 7 new References entries for citation integrity; prose content is approximately length-neutral)
