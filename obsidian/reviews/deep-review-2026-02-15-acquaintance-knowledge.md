## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Misattribution of symbol grounding problem**: Article attributed the symbol grounding problem to Roman Yampolskiy; the concept originates from Stevan Harnad (1990). Fixed: corrected attribution and added Harnad citation to References.
- **Missing citation**: McDowell's demonstrative concept argument ("that shade") was referenced without citation. Fixed: added McDowell (1994) to References.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Dennett's objection oversimplified**: Original text described Dennett as claiming "a truly omniscient Mary would predict her response." Dennett's actual position is more nuanced — he challenges whether the scenario is properly described at all. Fixed: rewrote to capture the disjunctive structure of his argument (either Mary doesn't know everything, or she already knows what red looks like).
- **Weak "persistence" argument**: The claim that "persistence of the debate across four decades suggests acquaintance knowledge resists dissolution" is an argumentum ad populum. Fixed: replaced with a structural argument about the dilemma facing all reductive strategies.
- **Tone mismatch with knowledge-argument.md**: The acquaintance-knowledge article treats Mary's learning as relatively certain ("she gains something her exhaustive physical knowledge could not provide") while the recently revised knowledge-argument.md uses more cautious conditional framing. Assessed but left as-is: the acquaintance-knowledge article qualifies this in the following sentence ("and the intuition that it is, while contested, remains powerful"), which provides adequate hedging.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist**: "Acquaintance knowledge" may not be a genuine epistemic category — it could be a folk-psychological label for neural activation patterns. Assessed: valid philosophical challenge but expected given the Map's dualist commitments. Not addressed in article as it would require engaging with eliminativism broadly.
- **Buddhist**: The indexical dimension presupposes a persistent self. Assessed: expected tension with non-self philosophies; the Map's framework assumes a subject of experience.
- **Empiricist**: What empirical predictions does acquaintance knowledge make? Assessed: the fineness-of-grain argument provides the closest empirical grounding (perceptual discrimination outstrips conceptual classification).

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening paragraph: excellent front-loading with precision and clarity
- Three-category taxonomy with "not rivals — they coexist" acknowledgment showing philosophical sophistication
- Phenomenal concept strategy dilemma (Chalmers' fork) presented crisply
- Indexical + qualitative dual dimension of Mary's gap — genuinely insightful addition to standard treatments
- Grief example for grounding asymmetry — vivid and effective
- Map/territory metaphor ("no number of maps adds up to visiting the territory") — apt and memorable
- Bidirectional interaction argument from Mary's report — compact and persuasive
- "The difficulty" counterpoint structure in physicalist responses — fair and structured engagement

### Enhancements Made
- Dennett's objection rewritten with disjunctive structure matching his actual argument
- Closing paragraph of knowledge argument section replaced with structural diagnosis
- Harnad attribution corrected with full citation
- McDowell citation added
- Added symbol-grounding to frontmatter concepts

### Cross-links Added
- symbol-grounding added to frontmatter concepts

## Remaining Items

- Consider adding [[introspection]] to Further Reading section in a future review, with a brief note on introspection reliability. The article currently treats phenomenal access as unproblematic; introspection.md's distinction between process-access and content-access could strengthen the position.
- Several related articles (qualia.md, phenomenal-consciousness.md, consciousness-only-territories.md) do not link back to acquaintance-knowledge.md. Reciprocal links could be added during future cross-reviews.

## Stability Notes

- Eliminative materialists will always question whether "acquaintance knowledge" is a genuine epistemic category rather than a folk-psychological mislabel. This is a bedrock disagreement, not a flaw to fix.
- The Buddhist critique of indexical self-presupposition reflects fundamental metaphysical disagreement with the Map's framework. Not a fixable issue.
- The tone difference with knowledge-argument.md is acceptable: acquaintance-knowledge.md presents the concept's philosophical grounding, while knowledge-argument.md focuses on the argument's vulnerabilities. Different emphases are appropriate.
