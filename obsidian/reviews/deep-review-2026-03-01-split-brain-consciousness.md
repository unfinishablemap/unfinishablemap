**Date**: 2026-03-01
**Article**: [[split-brain-consciousness|Split-Brain Cases and Consciousness Unity]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-03-split-brain-consciousness|2026-02-03]]
**Context**: Cross-review considering entanglement-binding-hypothesis insights

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None identified

### Medium Issues Found
- **Uncited 2020 review** (line 54): Article referenced "A 2020 review" without citation. *Resolution*: Rephrased to attribute the characterization to the 2017 Pinto et al. paper's own framing ("divided perception but undivided consciousness"), removing the uncited source.
- **Missing cross-link to entanglement-binding-hypothesis**: New concept article (2026-03-01) directly relevant to binding problem discussion and quantum mechanism sections was not referenced. *Resolution*: Added cross-links in concepts frontmatter, Connection to Binding Problem section, Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet section, and Further Reading.

### Counterarguments Considered
- Eliminative materialist: Indeterminacy-as-conceptual-inadequacy vs reality — already addressed in 2026-02-22 refinement with physical vagueness acknowledgment
- Dennett's heterophenomenology: Addressed in existing illusionist challenge section
- Tegmark's decoherence objection: Acknowledged in quantum section, now cross-linked to entanglement-binding-hypothesis which addresses it
- MWI defender: Bedrock disagreement, noted in previous reviews
- Buddhist no-self: Well-integrated in Contemplative Evidence section

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Three-dimensional phenomenal unity framework (synchronic, diachronic, subject)
- Nagel's indeterminacy thesis — five interpretations and "no whole number" conclusion
- Process philosophy integration with actual occasions and prehension
- Illusionist challenge with structural response (regress + indeterminacy persistence)
- Falsifiability conditions (five specific challenges listed)
- Open Question conclusion
- 2026-02-22 refinements (fixed non-sequitur, neural/phenomenal distinction, mechanism-neutral quantum section)

### Enhancements Made
- **Entanglement binding cross-links**: Added [[entanglement-binding-hypothesis]] reference in binding problem section — explains why minimal fiber connections preserve unity (entangled states don't require massive causal throughput)
- **Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet enriched**: Replaced generic "quantum-level coherence" reference with specific cross-link to entanglement-binding-hypothesis
- **Uncited source fixed**: Replaced reference to unnamed 2020 review with attribution to 2017 paper's own framing
- **Redundancy removed**: Deleted duplicate hard-problem paragraph (lines 127-129 repeated lines 123-124 almost verbatim)
- **Process philosophy tightened**: Removed redundant sentences to maintain length neutrality
- **AI refinement log removed**: Comment at end of file requested removal after human review

### Cross-links Added
- [[entanglement-binding-hypothesis]] (concepts frontmatter, binding problem section, MQI tenet section, Further Reading)

## Remaining Items

None. Article remains in stable state with entanglement-binding-hypothesis now integrated.

## Stability Notes

This is the fourth deep review of this article (2026-01-16, 2026-01-21, 2026-02-03, 2026-03-01). The article was declared stable in the previous review. This review was triggered by the cross-review context: the new entanglement-binding-hypothesis concept article required integration.

Changes were minimal and focused:
1. Cross-linking to the new entanglement-binding-hypothesis concept
2. Fixing an uncited source
3. Removing genuine redundancy
4. Cleaning up a stale refinement log comment

The article's core arguments, structure, and voice remain unchanged. Future reviews should expect no changes unless:
1. New empirical findings on split-brain patients emerge
2. New concept articles require cross-linking
3. Specific factual errors are discovered

Bedrock philosophical disagreements remain as expected:
- Eliminative materialists will always dispute the significance of indeterminacy
- Illusionists will reject the presupposition of phenomenal consciousness
- MWI defenders will find the No Many Worlds section unsatisfying

## Word Count
- Before: 3482
- After: 3469
- Change: -13 (length-neutral mode maintained)
