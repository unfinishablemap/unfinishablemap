**Date**: 2026-02-22
**Article**: [[disorders-of-consciousness-as-test-cases|Disorders of Consciousness as Test Cases]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-15-disorders-of-consciousness-as-test-cases|2026-02-15]]

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. All critical issues from the previous review (COGITATE mischaracterization, incorrect CMD figure, broken link, incorrect first author, frontmatter misclassification) remain correctly resolved. No new critical issues detected.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Orphaned article (zero inbound links)**: The article had no inbound links from any other site content despite being highly relevant to multiple existing articles. **Resolution**: Added 7 inbound cross-references from loss-of-consciousness, filter-theory, neural-correlates-of-consciousness, pain-asymbolia-as-central-test-case, ethics-of-consciousness, integrated-information-theory, and functionalism.
- **Missing outbound links to parallel test case articles**: The article did not link to pain-asymbolia-as-central-test-case or split-brain-consciousness, which are structurally parallel articles that test the same theories using different clinical dissociations. **Resolution**: Added both to Further Reading section.

### Counterarguments Considered
No new counterarguments needed—all were addressed in the previous review. Bedrock disagreements (materialist accommodation of CMD, functionalist response, COGITATE interpretation) remain stable.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clinical spectrum overview (coma → UWS → MCS → locked-in → CMD) remains clear and well-structured
- Discrimination problem section with presence/absence asymmetry argument is philosophically strong
- "What Would Challenge This View" section provides concrete falsification conditions
- Theory-testing framework (functionalism, GNWT, IIT, higher-order) engages fairly with each
- Confident but measured voice maintained throughout
- Reference list with primary sources is solid

### Enhancements Made
- Added 2 outbound cross-links to parallel test case articles (pain-asymbolia, split-brain)
- Added 7 inbound cross-references from related articles to resolve orphan status:
  - [[loss-of-consciousness]] (CMD section)
  - [[filter-theory]] (covert consciousness section)
  - [[neural-correlates-of-consciousness]] (filter theory section)
  - [[pain-asymbolia-as-central-test-case]] (opening comparison of dissociations)
  - [[ethics-of-consciousness]] (vegetative states mention)
  - [[integrated-information-theory]] (What's Unconscious section)
  - [[functionalism]] (boundary cases section)

### Cross-links Added
- Outbound: [[pain-asymbolia-as-central-test-case]], [[split-brain-consciousness]]
- Inbound: 7 articles now link to disorders-of-consciousness-as-test-cases (previously 0)

## Remaining Items

None. The article is stable after two reviews. Content quality is high, all previous issues remain resolved, and the orphan status has been addressed through comprehensive cross-referencing.

## Stability Notes

- All stability notes from the previous review remain valid:
  - Materialist accommodation of CMD is a bedrock disagreement, not a flaw
  - COGITATE doesn't support the Map's position; it shows current theories are incomplete
  - Functionalist response to CMD is legitimate; the article's counter is fair but won't convince committed functionalists
- The article has now reached stability. Two reviews have addressed all critical and medium issues. Future reviews should focus on whether newly created content warrants additional cross-links, not on re-examining the article's arguments.
