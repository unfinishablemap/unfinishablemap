## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Broken wikilink**: `[[voluntary-attention]]` linked to non-existent concept. Resolution: replaced with plain text "deliberate attention" (concept `attention-as-interface` already linked nearby).
- **Broken Further Reading link**: `[[contemplative-training-and-phenomenal-access]]` does not exist as a file. Resolution: replaced with `[[anoetic-noetic-autonoetic-consciousness]]` which exists and is relevant (the three consciousness levels map onto the three skill phases).
- **Uncited references**: Macnamara et al. (2014), Dreyfus & Dreyfus (1986), Csikszentmihalyi (1990), and Merleau-Ponty (1945) were in References but never cited in the text. Macnamara in particular challenges the Ericsson deliberate practice evidence. Resolution: all four now cited inline.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Friction Model underhedged**: Quantum mechanisms presented with more confidence than warranted per writing style guide restraint requirements. Resolution: added speculative hedging ("offers a speculative but illuminating reframing," "experience of effort *may* be," "This model is speculative").
- **Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet overconfident**: Zeno effect applied to skill acquisition without flagging speculation. Resolution: reframed with "If the friction model is correct," "On one speculative reading," "This remains a possible mechanism."
- **Phase two agency claim**: "Each delegation is itself a conscious act" stated as fact. Resolution: softened to "appears to involve conscious agency" with materialist alternative noted.
- **Macnamara meta-analysis gap**: Listed in references but not engaged with, despite challenging the Ericsson evidence base. Resolution: added paragraph engaging with the 12% variance finding and reframing the Map's argument accordingly.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist**: Neural plasticity mechanisms provide complete causal accounts — acknowledged throughout article, no new edits needed
- **Dennett-style physicalism**: Phenomenological description doesn't establish causal efficacy — article already acknowledges this honestly
- **Quantum skepticism**: Zeno effect and friction model are speculative — now properly hedged
- **Macnamara challenge to deliberate practice**: Only 12% variance explained — now engaged with explicitly

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening paragraph: vivid, concrete, immediately communicates the paradox
- Three-phase model: clear structure with philosophical depth at each stage
- Honest engagement with materialist counterarguments throughout
- The Return Problem section: original contribution, deepens the paradox beyond static accounts
- Epistemic calibration: "supports rather than proves," "compatible with but not uniquely supported by"
- Architectural metaphor: effective and non-fallacious (doesn't beg the question)

### Enhancements Made
- Integrated Dreyfus & Dreyfus (1986) and Merleau-Ponty (1945) citations to ground the three-phase model in established phenomenological literature
- Added Csikszentmihalyi (1990) inline citation at flow reference
- Engaged with Macnamara et al. (2014) meta-analysis honestly, reframing the Map's argument to rest on quality-dependence rather than practice-as-sole-determinant
- Added `[[agent-causation]]` cross-link in article body (was only in frontmatter)
- Replaced broken Further Reading link with relevant existing concept
- Removed stale AI refinement log comment (marked for removal)

### Cross-links Added
- [[agent-causation]] — linked in phase two discussion
- [[anoetic-noetic-autonoetic-consciousness]] — added to Further Reading and related_articles

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues have been addressed.

## Stability Notes

- The fundamental tension between materialist functional explanations and dualist phenomenal-causal accounts is a bedrock philosophical disagreement, not a flaw. The eliminative materialist will always find the phenomenal-to-causal inference unconvincing; the article handles this by presenting the argument as supporting rather than proving dualism.
- The Friction Model depends on the Map's quantum interaction framework. If that framework is discredited, the Friction Model section would need revision, but the article's core argument (the three-phase paradox, the architectural metaphor, the return problem) survives without it.
- Future reviews should NOT re-flag: the hedging of quantum mechanisms (now adequate), the Macnamara engagement (now present), or the honest acknowledgment of materialist responses (consistently maintained).
