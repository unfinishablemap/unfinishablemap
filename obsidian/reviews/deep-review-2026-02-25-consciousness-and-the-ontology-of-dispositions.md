**Date**: 2026-02-25
**Article**: [[consciousness-and-the-ontology-of-dispositions|Consciousness and the Ontology of Dispositions]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-21-consciousness-and-the-ontology-of-dispositions|2026-02-21]]

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. Attribution accuracy verified: Bird extrapolation remains properly marked as Map's own extension; pain-asymbolia framing remains appropriate ("consistent with"); all philosopher positions accurately attributed to cited works.

### Medium Issues Found

- **Missing cross-link to consciousness-and-the-metaphysics-of-laws**: The metaphysics of laws article has a dedicated section on "Dispositional Essentialism and Phenomenal Powers" directly relevant to this article's discussion of Bird's framework. **Resolution**: Added inline cross-reference in the psychophysical laws paragraph and to Further Reading.
- **Missing cross-link to why-pain-hurts**: The pain-asymbolia discussion connects directly to the why-pain-hurts article's treatment of quality-power inseparability. **Resolution**: Added inline cross-reference in the pain-asymbolia paragraph.
- **Missing cross-link to the-epiphenomenalist-threat**: The powerful qualities framework provides a direct escape from epiphenomenalism. **Resolution**: Added to Further Reading and related_articles.
- **knowledge-argument referenced in text but absent from frontmatter concepts**: The article discusses the knowledge argument by name but didn't list it as a concept. **Resolution**: Added to concepts frontmatter.
- **Zero inbound links (orphan status)**: The article was created 2026-02-18 and had no inbound links from any content article. This was the primary focus of this review. **Resolution**: Added inbound links from 8 articles (see Cross-links Added below).

### Counterarguments Considered

Per stability notes from previous review, the following are bedrock philosophical disagreements, not fixable flaws:
- Eliminative materialist critique (assumes qualia are real — foundational commitment)
- Buddhist no-self critique (assumes unified subject — foundational commitment)
- Quantum skeptic's decoherence objection (handled in other Map articles)

No new counterarguments required addressing.

## Attribution Accuracy Check

- **Misattribution**: None found. All positions accurately attributed.
- **Qualifier preservation**: Bird extrapolation properly marked as Map's extension (unchanged from previous review).
- **Position strength**: Appropriate use of "the Map argues," "the Map finds," "consistent with."
- **Source/Map separation**: Clean throughout.
- **Self-contradiction**: None detected.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- The three-position taxonomy (pandispositionalism, categoricalism, identity theory) — clear, well-structured, philosophically accurate
- The pandispositionalist dilemma — cleanly forces a choice between functionalism and abandoning the thesis
- The "Dispositional Modality Problem" section — the article's most original contribution, distinguishing outward-pointing physical dispositions from bidirectional phenomenal dispositions
- The closing "central insight" paragraph — memorable formulation that the mind-body problem is about what properties are
- The pain-asymbolia example (properly framed as "consistent with")
- Knowledge argument deployment with physicalist contestation acknowledged

### Enhancements Made

- Added cross-reference to [[consciousness-and-the-metaphysics-of-laws]] in the psychophysical laws discussion
- Added cross-reference to [[why-pain-hurts]] in the pain-asymbolia discussion
- Added [[the-epiphenomenalist-threat]], [[consciousness-and-the-metaphysics-of-laws]], and [[why-pain-hurts]] to Further Reading
- Added [[knowledge-argument]] to frontmatter concepts
- Expanded related_articles with 3 new entries

### Cross-links Added (Orphan Integration — Primary Focus)

**Inbound links added FROM these articles TO consciousness-and-the-ontology-of-dispositions:**

1. [[causal-powers]] — Added inline reference in Powers vs. Categorical Properties section and to Further Reading
2. [[consciousness-and-causal-powers]] — Added inline reference in For Metaphysics section and to Further Reading
3. [[consciousness-and-the-metaphysics-of-laws]] — Added inline reference in Dispositional Essentialism section and to Further Reading
4. [[russellian-monism]] — Added inline reference in Clearer Ontology paragraph and to Further Reading
5. [[why-pain-hurts]] — Added inline reference in Inseparability of Character and Causal Power section
6. [[the-epiphenomenalist-threat]] — Added inline reference in Property Dualism Without Interaction section
7. [[mental-causation]] — Added to Further Reading
8. [[explanatory-gap]] — Added to Further Reading
9. [[knowledge-argument]] — Added to Further Reading

**Total inbound links: 0 → 9** (orphan status fully resolved)

## Remaining Items

None. The article was already in good shape from the previous review. This review focused on orphan integration, which is now complete.

## Stability Notes

- Previous review's stability notes remain in effect: eliminative materialist, Buddhist, and quantum skeptic critiques are bedrock disagreements, not issues to re-flag.
- Pain-asymbolia's "consistent with" framing is appropriate and should not be strengthened or weakened.
- The article has now been reviewed twice with no critical issues found either time. It has reached stability. Future reviews should focus on changes to related articles that might warrant new cross-links, not on re-examining the article's core arguments.
