**Date**: 2026-01-30
**Article**: [[agent-causation|Agent Causation]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-20-agent-causation|2026-01-20]]

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None. Article has stabilized after previous review addressed key gaps.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Unsupported specific claim**: Line 138 stated "Current accuracy (~60%) leaves room" without citation. [Resolution: Softened to "Current prediction accuracy remains well below this threshold" to avoid requiring specific citation while preserving the argument]

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist**: Rejects "consciousness" as natural kind exercising causal powers. [Status: Bedrock disagreement—article operates within framework eliminativists reject wholesale]
- **Heterophenomenologist**: Phenomenology as data about beliefs, not metaphysical evidence. [Status: Article appeals to neural evidence alongside phenomenology; tension acknowledged]
- **Quantum skeptic**: Decoherence objection. [Status: Already addressed in previous review with subsection on decoherence]
- **Many-worlds defender**: If all outcomes occur, no selection. [Status: Acknowledged as falsifier at line 143; cross-linked to many-worlds article]
- **Buddhist philosopher**: What grounds the "substance"? [Status: Whitehead process philosophy section provides alternative framing]

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Two-domain convergence argument (attention + motor selection)
- Phenomenological descriptions (directing vs being captured distinction)
- Kane's 2024 evolution and sourcehood treatment
- Whitehead/process philosophy integration
- Retrocausal deepening of sourcehood claim
- Skill delegation and choking phenomenon evidence
- Creative generation section (Bergson, Boden, Hausman)
- Comprehensive falsifiability section

### Enhancements Made
1. **Softened unsupported claim**: Replaced specific "~60%" figure with more defensible general statement
2. **Added explanatory-gap cross-link**: Added [[explanatory-gap]] to concepts frontmatter for property dualist readers
3. **Added Further Reading entry**: Added [[explanatory-gap]] with context "Why physical description leaves consciousness unexplained"

### Cross-links Added
- [[explanatory-gap]]

## Remaining Items

None. Article has reached good stability. Two reviews have addressed major gaps (falsifiability, decoherence, cross-links, illusionism engagement). Current review made only minor refinements.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed twice. Key philosophical disagreements are acknowledged as bedrock:
- Eliminativists will reject the category "consciousness" as exercising causal powers
- Heterophenomenologists will question reliance on phenomenology
- MWI proponents will reject collapse-based frameworks

These are fundamental philosophical disagreements, not fixable problems. Future reviews should NOT re-flag them as critical issues—the article engages these perspectives fairly and explains why the Map's position holds.

The article has achieved good balance: comprehensive without being overlong (1910 words, 76% of soft threshold), well-cross-linked, falsifiable, and properly integrated with site tenets.
