## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Six adversarial personas applied. This is the third review of this article; it has stabilized well.

### Critical Issues Found
- None

### Medium Issues Found
- **Frontmatter miscategorization**: `first-person-third-person-methodology` and `quantum-neural-timing-constraints` were listed under `concepts:` but are actually topics. Moved to `topics:` list.
  - Resolution: Fixed frontmatter categorization
- **Broken related_article**: `mysterianism-cognitive-closure` listed in related_articles doesn't exist as an article (only as research notes). Removed; `mysterianism` already present.
  - Resolution: Removed non-existent link
- **Uncontextualized empirical claim**: "280-300ms neural decision windows" lacked inline attribution context.
  - Resolution: Added "identified in Libet-type experiments" parenthetical

### Counterarguments Considered
- Eliminative materialist: "irreducibly mental elements" in Buddhist section assumes what it needs to prove — bedrock disagreement, not fixable
- Dennett: determinacy challenge to Frankish could use citation — low priority, argument stands on its own
- Buddhist (Nagarjuna): Madhyamaka would challenge "irreducibly mental elements" — noted in previous review as low priority, deferred again

## Attribution Accuracy Check

All attributions verified:
- [x] Bloom (2004) — dual cognitive systems, "natural-born dualists"
- [x] Barrett et al. (2021) — cross-cultural study, "intuitive materialism"
- [x] Barlev & Shtulman (2021) — dualism is learned
- [x] Bering (2002, 2006) — simulation constraints
- [x] Berent et al. (2024) — LLM dualist representations
- [x] Chudek et al. (2018) — cross-cultural children's intuitions
- [x] Richert & Harris (2008) — dualism suppressed not eliminated
- [x] Willard & Norenzayan (2013) — mentalizing pathway
- [x] Fox et al. (2012) — meditation predicts introspective accuracy
- [x] Frankish (2016) — quasi-phenomenal properties

No misattributions, dropped qualifiers, overstated positions, or source/Map conflation found.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Genetic fallacy argument: "Folk physics is largely accurate for everyday objects despite being wrong about quantum mechanics" — excellent analogy
- Symmetric problem: "If cognitive naturalness disqualifies beliefs, intuitive materialism would also be suspect" — powerful rhetorical move
- Process philosophy integration: insight that both intuitive camps correctly sense one pole — genuinely novel
- "Explaining the belief doesn't explain the explanandum" — concise and devastating
- "What Would Challenge This View?" section — model of intellectual honesty
- Contemplative evidence — adds empirical dimension most philosophy-of-mind articles lack

### Enhancements Made
- Frontmatter accuracy: corrected topic/concept categorization
- Removed non-existent related_article link (mysterianism-cognitive-closure)
- Added empirical context for 280-300ms timing claim

### Cross-links Added
- None new (existing cross-links are comprehensive)

## Remaining Items

None. Article has reached stability after three reviews.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed three times (2026-01-20, 2026-01-24, 2026-02-06). It has stabilized well:

- The core arguments (genetic fallacy, symmetric problem, hard problem persistence) are sound and well-expressed
- Attribution accuracy is clean across all 10 cited sources
- The process philosophy section and contemplative evidence are distinctive strengths
- Bedrock disagreements: Eliminative materialists will always object to "irreducibly mental elements" in the Buddhist section; Madhyamaka Buddhists would challenge the same phrase from the opposite direction. These are philosophical standoffs, not flaws to fix
- The article is well below word count thresholds (1,783 words vs 2,500 soft limit) but feels complete — expansion would risk padding
- Future reviews should focus on verifying new content hasn't been added that introduces problems, not re-examining stable sections
