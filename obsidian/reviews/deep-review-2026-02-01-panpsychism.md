**Date**: 2026-02-01
**Article**: [[panpsychism|Panpsychism]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-29-panpsychism|2026-01-29]]
**Context**: Cross-review considering IIT critique article

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None

### Medium Issues Found
- **IIT section lacked cross-link to critique article**: The panpsychism article discusses IIT as "a scientific panpsychism" but didn't point readers to the Map's comprehensive IIT critique ([[integrated-information-theory-critique]]), which details the passivity problem, expander graph problem, and temporal gap. Added inline cross-link and frontmatter reference.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminativist challenge**: Marked as bedrock disagreement in previous reviews—not re-flagged
- **Hard problem contestability**: Previous reviews noted this as philosophical territory, not fixable flaw

### Attribution Accuracy Check
- No source-based attribution issues found
- Claims about Strawson, Goff, Whitehead, Chalmers, Tononi are general philosophical positions
- No misattributed quotes or dropped qualifiers

### Cross-Review Consistency Check
Verified consistency between panpsychism.md and integrated-information-theory-critique.md:
- Both correctly identify IIT's passivity/identity problem
- Both note conflict with Bidirectional Interaction tenet
- Both acknowledge IIT takes consciousness seriously (aligns with Dualism tenet)
- Panpsychism.md now links to the full critique for readers wanting deeper analysis
- **No contradictions found**

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Front-loaded summary (excellent truncation resilience)
- Key Differences comparison table (clear, fair)
- Whitehead/process philosophy section (previous reviews noted as strength)
- Empirical boundary cases subsection with C. elegans, Hydra, slime molds
- "What Panpsychism Gets Right" section showing intellectual honesty
- Comprehensive existing cross-links (consciousness-in-simple-organisms, analytic idealism, Russellian monism, etc.)

### Enhancements Made
1. **Added inline cross-link to IIT critique**: In the IIT section, pointing to [[integrated-information-theory-critique|Why Integrated Information Theory Falls Short]]
2. **Added to frontmatter related_articles**: [[integrated-information-theory-critique]]

### Cross-links Added
- [[integrated-information-theory-critique]] (inline and frontmatter)

## Word Count

- Before: ~2678 words (107% of 2500 target)
- After: ~2695 words (108% of 2500 target)
- Change: +17 words (cross-link additions only, acceptable for cross-referencing)

## Remaining Items

None. The article is now well-integrated with the IIT critique article following this cross-review.

## Stability Notes

This is the **fifth review** of panpsychism.md:
1. Initial review (January 2026)
2. 2026-01-27: intrinsic-nature-void cross-review (no critical issues)
3. 2026-01-27: process-philosophy cross-review (no critical issues)
4. 2026-01-29: consciousness-in-simple-organisms cross-review (no critical issues)
5. 2026-02-01: IIT critique cross-review (no critical issues)

The article has clearly stabilized. Main changes across reviews have been adding cross-links to related articles as they're created or reviewed, not substantive content revisions.

**Key cross-reference achieved**: The IIT section in panpsychism.md now links to the comprehensive critique article, allowing readers interested in the Map's full assessment of IIT to find the detailed analysis of passivity, expander graphs, and temporal gaps.

Future reviews should not re-flag:
- Eliminativist disagreement (expected given tenets)
- Process philosophy tensions (addressed in dedicated article)
- Need for more organism detail (linked to dedicated article)
- Need for more IIT critique detail (now linked to dedicated article)
