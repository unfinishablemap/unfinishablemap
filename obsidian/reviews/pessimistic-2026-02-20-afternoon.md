## Executive Summary

Five recently created, unreviewed articles were examined. The strongest issues are: the control-theoretic-will article's analogy between consciousness and engineering control systems is more metaphorical than it admits, risking reification of an analogy into an ontological claim; the convergence-arguments article's treatment of vitalism as a failed convergence case actually undermines the Map's central convergence argument more than the article acknowledges; and the theoretical-virtues article's claim that virtue-failure is "predicted by dualism" is a non-sequitur that smuggles in a dubious meta-argument. Across all five articles, there is a recurring pattern of treating the Map's framework as epistemically privileged rather than genuinely engaging with the strongest available objections.

## Critiques by Philosopher

### The Eliminative Materialist

Patricia Churchland would target the valence article most aggressively. The claim that "the badness of pain is a feature of the experience itself, not something the experience is about" presupposes a folk-psychological category (intrinsic felt badness) that neuroscience may dissolve entirely. The pain asymbolia argument cuts both ways: if specific brain damage can eliminate the felt badness while preserving pain processing, this shows that "valence" is a *neural product*, not an irreducible phenomenal primitive. The dissociation tells us something about neural architecture, not about ontology. The article treats the separation as evidence for dualism when it is equally — perhaps more naturally — evidence that what we call "valence" is a specific computational process that can be selectively disrupted. Churchland would note that calling something "intrinsic" does not make it non-physical; it may simply mean we haven't yet identified the relevant neural mechanism.

The Galilean exclusion article would receive similar criticism. The claim that science "was designed to work without subjectivity" mischaracterises scientific methodology. Neuroimaging, psychophysics, and computational neuroscience increasingly work *with* subjective reports as data. The methodological exclusion Galileo instituted for physics has not constrained neuroscience the way the article implies. The "sieve that cannot study sand" metaphor is rhetorically effective but misleading — neuroscience has not excluded consciousness from study, merely from its explanatory primitives, which is standard scientific practice for any target of investigation.

### The Hard-Nosed Physicalist

Dennett would focus on the control-theoretic-will article's sleight of hand. The article claims the control-theoretic framing "describes what consciousness *does*, not what consciousness *is*" — but then proceeds to draw ontological conclusions from the description. If the controller is "distinct from the plant it governs," and this maps onto consciousness being distinct from the brain, the article has smuggled in substance dualism via engineering metaphor. A thermostat is distinct from the building it heats, but this does not make the thermostat non-physical. The controller/plant distinction is a modelling choice, not a metaphysical discovery.

The theoretical-virtues article's claim that "the entire suite of virtues malfunctions" for consciousness would provoke Dennett's deepest scepticism. The article defines each virtue's failure in a way that presupposes the hard problem is genuine. If consciousness is a set of cognitive abilities and dispositions — Dennett's heterophenomenological position — then empirical adequacy, explanatory power, and all the rest work perfectly well. The virtues "malfunction" only if you insist on a conception of phenomenal consciousness that is, in Dennett's view, confused. The article treats the hard problem as given rather than defended, then uses the theoretical virtues' inability to handle it as further evidence for dualism. This is question-begging of a sophisticated kind.

### The Quantum Skeptic

Tegmark would note that the control-theoretic-will article relies heavily on a "~10 bits/second" bandwidth figure for consciousness, which originates from psychophysical experiments about conscious tracking and decision-making rates (Meister 2024 is cited). But this figure describes *reportable* conscious processing, not the bandwidth of any causal channel between a non-physical consciousness and quantum systems. The article slides from a psychophysical measurement to a claim about the bandwidth of a non-physical control signal with no justification for treating these as the same quantity.

The "quantum selection mechanism" listed as the "actuator" in the control theory table has no physical specification. What quantum system is being selected? What observable is being measured? At what spatial scale? The article treats "quantum selection" as a well-defined engineering component when it is, at best, a placeholder for an unspecified mechanism. A control-theoretic analysis requires quantitative specification of the actuator — without it, the formalism is decorative, not functional.

### The Many-Worlds Defender

Deutsch would attack the convergence-arguments article's treatment of independence. The article acknowledges that the knowledge argument and qualia arguments "both depend on phenomenal intuition," and that the conceivability and modal arguments "both exploit logical possibility." This leaves two genuinely independent clusters, not five or six independent arguments. Two clusters providing moderate support for a conclusion is far weaker than the article's rhetoric suggests. Furthermore, both clusters may share a deeper dependence: the intuition that there is "something it is like" to have an experience. If this intuition is a cognitive artefact — a product of how brains model themselves — then all the arguments collapse simultaneously, regardless of their surface independence.

The No Many Worlds tenet is invoked in the control-theoretic-will article with the claim that "under many-worlds, both outcomes occur; the control signal has no genuine effect." This mischaracterises MWI. Under Everett, the branching structure is real, and decision-theoretic arguments (Wallace 2012) provide reasons for agents to care about which branch they will experience. The claim that control requires "real selection among genuinely exclusive alternatives" assumes a single-outcome metaphysics that MWI denies — but the denial is precisely what is at issue, making the argument circular.

### The Empiricist

Popper's ghost would find rich targets. The control-theoretic-will article is the clearest case. What experiment could distinguish between:
(a) Consciousness as a non-physical controller that biases quantum outcomes, and
(b) A fully physical system that produces the *experience* of deliberate control as a byproduct of neural computation?

The article proposes no test. The "open questions" section asks about formal specification, stability conditions, and observability limits — all internal to the framework — but never asks: what would falsify this? If the control-theoretic model makes no predictions that differ from physicalist neuroscience, it is not a scientific hypothesis. The Popperian verdict: elegant metaphysics, but "not even wrong."

The convergence-arguments article faces a subtler falsifiability problem. The article states that "a convergence argument remains in force until a specific dissolution is provided" and that the burden is on the critic "to provide the actual dissolution for the specific case at hand." This shifts the burden of proof in an unfalsifiable direction: the convergence argument stands unless someone provides a reductive explanation of consciousness. Since no one can currently do this (by hypothesis, it's the hard problem), the argument becomes immune to refutation by design. This is epistemically problematic — the absence of a dissolution today does not demonstrate that one is impossible.

### The Buddhist Philosopher

Nagarjuna would find the control-theoretic-will article's framework deeply confused. The entire control-theoretic model presupposes a substantial self — a controller that stands apart from what it controls, persisting through time, making decisions, holding intentions. This is precisely the kind of reification Buddhist philosophy identifies as the root of metaphysical error. The "controller" is not found in experience; what is found is a flow of momentary awarenesses, none of which is "the controller." The article's table mapping consciousness to an engineering controller makes the reification explicit and unreflective.

The valence article's claim that "the badness of pain is a feature of the experience itself" would be challenged from a Buddhist perspective. In Abhidharma analysis, vedanā (feeling-tone) arises dependently — conditioned by contact, perception, and mental formations. It is not an intrinsic property of anything. Calling valence "intrinsic" rather than "dependently arising" smuggles in a substantialist metaphysics of experience that Buddhist philosophy has spent millennia deconstructing. The article does not engage with this alternative at all.

## Critical Issues

### Issue 1: Control-Theoretic Will — Analogy Treated as Architecture

- **File**: concepts/control-theoretic-will.md
- **Location**: "The Controller, Not the Computer" section and mapping table
- **Problem**: The article presents a metaphorical mapping between control theory concepts and the Map's framework as if it were an architectural description. The table equating "Plant = Brain," "Controller = Consciousness," "Actuator = Quantum selection mechanism" is presented as a structural claim but functions as an analogy. The gap between "consciousness can be described as if it were a controller" and "consciousness is a controller" is never bridged. The article acknowledges the distinction briefly ("describes what consciousness does, not what consciousness is") but then draws conclusions that require the stronger reading.
- **Severity**: High
- **Recommendation**: Add a section explicitly addressing the analogy-to-ontology gap. Acknowledge that control-theoretic language is a modelling tool, not evidence for dualism. The current framing allows readers to mistake vocabulary for discovery.

### Issue 2: Convergence Arguments — The Vitalism Precedent Undermines More Than Acknowledged

- **File**: topics/epistemology-of-convergence-arguments.md
- **Location**: "When Convergence Fails" section, vitalism subsection
- **Problem**: The article notes that vitalism had genuine convergence that proved wrong, then argues this doesn't damage the consciousness convergence because "neural correlates have been mapped in extraordinary detail, but correlation is not reduction." But the vitalism case failed precisely because mechanistic explanations were eventually found for what had seemed irreducible. The article's response — that no consciousness analogue of Wöhler's urea synthesis exists — is an argument from current ignorance, not from principle. The article needs to address *why* the consciousness case is structurally different from vitalism beyond the observation that a reductive explanation hasn't appeared yet. Without this, the vitalism example undercuts the Map's position more than it supports it.
- **Severity**: High
- **Recommendation**: The article should articulate what structural feature of the consciousness case makes it resistant to the vitalism pattern. Candidate arguments exist (the conceivability argument targets a logical relationship, not an empirical one; the knowledge argument doesn't depend on current scientific ignorance). The article should deploy them rather than resting on "no dissolution has been provided."

### Issue 3: Theoretical Virtues — Self-Undermining Meta-Argument

- **File**: topics/consciousness-and-the-problem-of-theoretical-virtues.md
- **Location**: "The Systematic Nature of the Failure" and "Relation to Site Perspective"
- **Problem**: The article argues that theoretical virtues malfunction for consciousness, then claims this malfunction is "predicted by dualism and anomalous for physicalism." But if theoretical virtues genuinely cannot adjudicate the mind-body problem, they also cannot be used to support dualism. The claim that virtue-failure is "predicted by dualism" treats dualism as a meta-theory that stands above the virtues, immune to the very critique the article develops. This is inconsistent: you cannot argue that the machinery of theory-choice is broken, then use theory-choice reasoning (dualism predicts X, physicalism doesn't) to prefer dualism.
- **Severity**: High
- **Recommendation**: Either acknowledge that virtue-failure is neutral between dualism and physicalism (both frameworks struggle to explain why the virtues fail), or develop the meta-argument more carefully by distinguishing between first-order virtue application (which the article rightly criticises) and second-order reasoning about why virtues fail (which requires its own epistemological justification).

### Issue 4: Valence — Pain Asymbolia Overclaimed

- **File**: concepts/valence.md
- **Location**: "Why the Hedonic Account Is Stronger" and "Valence Does Causal Work"
- **Problem**: Pain asymbolia is cited both as evidence that valence is an intrinsic phenomenal property *and* as evidence that valence is causally efficacious. These claims jointly require that (a) the felt badness is not a representation, and (b) the felt badness causes behaviour. But a physicalist can accommodate asymbolia by positing that "felt badness" is a specific neural process that can be selectively disrupted — the dissociation tells us about neural architecture, not about ontological categories. The article does not engage with the physicalist interpretation of asymbolia and treats the phenomenal interpretation as the only viable one.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Recommendation**: Engage with the physicalist reading of asymbolia. The claim should be: "asymbolia is *consistent with* the hedonic account and *challenges* strong evaluativism," not that it provides "decisive evidence" for the hedonic account over physicalism.

### Issue 5: Galilean Exclusion — Missing Engagement with Naturalised Phenomenology

- **File**: concepts/galilean-exclusion.md
- **Location**: "The Problem When Consciousness Is the Target" and "The Exclusion in Contemporary Debates"
- **Problem**: The article presents the Galilean exclusion as creating a binary: either stay within the framework (functionalism, computationalism) and miss experience, or break from it (panpsychism, enactivism) and risk losing rigour. This overlooks naturalised phenomenology and neurophenomenology, which specifically claim to integrate first-person and third-person methods *within* a naturalistic framework. The article mentions neurophenomenology in the contemporary debates section but only as an example of "breaking from the framework." This undersells the challenge these programmes pose: if they succeed, the exclusion is not as structurally entrenched as the article claims.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Recommendation**: Engage with the strongest version of naturalised phenomenology's response to the Galilean exclusion. If it can be shown that such programmes ultimately presuppose the exclusion at some level, argue that explicitly. Currently the article assumes they fail without demonstrating why.

## Counterarguments to Address

### The Control Law Specification Problem
- **Current content says**: Consciousness operates as a low-bandwidth control signal steering neural dynamics.
- **A critic would argue**: Without specifying the control law (the mathematical relationship between phenomenal states and control outputs), the framework is empirically empty. Control theory's value lies in quantitative prediction; stripping that away leaves only metaphor.
- **Suggested response**: Acknowledge this forthrightly as the framework's primary weakness, and outline what a formal specification would need to include. The current "Open Questions" section is too diffuse.

### Convergence Without Independence
- **Current content says**: Multiple arguments for dualism converge, providing cumulative evidence.
- **A critic would argue**: All the arguments share a dependence on the *intuition* that there is something it is like to have experience. If this intuition is a cognitive artefact, all arguments fail together.
- **Suggested response**: The article should address the "common root" objection directly. One defence: the intuition is not merely an intuition but a datum — it is the phenomenon itself, not a belief about the phenomenon. This needs to be made explicit.

### Theoretical Virtues and Mysterianism
- **Current content says**: The systematic failure of theoretical virtues marks "the boundary where physical description ends."
- **A critic would argue**: McGinn's mysterianism (cited in the article's further reading) offers a third option: the virtues fail because human cognitive architecture cannot grasp the solution, not because the solution is non-physical.
- **Suggested response**: Engage with mysterianism as a genuine competitor. The article's Relation to Site Perspective claims virtue-failure supports dualism, but mysterianism offers an equally parsimonious reading. The article should explain why dualism is preferred over cognitive closure.

## Unsupported Claims

| Claim | Location | Needed Support |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| "~10 bits/second channel" for conscious control | control-theoretic-will.md: opening paragraph | Meister 2024 is cited but the extrapolation from psychophysical bandwidth to non-physical causal bandwidth needs justification |
| "Vitalism's convergence collapsed because biochemistry provided specific mechanisms" | epistemology-of-convergence-arguments.md: vitalism section | No citation for the claim that vitalism had genuine philosophical convergence comparable to the consciousness case |
| "Barrett, L. F., & Russell, J. A. (1999)" — claim that "we are never affectively neutral" | valence.md: opening section | The core affect model is presented as established fact rather than a debated position in affective science |
| "The hard problem becomes less mysterious... when understood as arising from a methodological architecture" | galilean-exclusion.md: contemporary debates | This understates the hard problem — Chalmers would reject the claim that understanding its genealogy makes it "less mysterious" |
| "Every major model of scientific explanation breaks down when applied to consciousness" | theoretical-virtues.md: explanatory power section | Claim attributed to another Map article but not independently supported here; readers need at least a summary of why |

## Language Improvements

| Current | Issue | Suggested |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| "Pain asymbolia provides the decisive evidence" (valence.md) | "Decisive" is too strong for a contested interpretation | "Pain asymbolia provides the strongest single line of evidence" |
| "This systematic failure is itself evidence about the nature of consciousness" (theoretical-virtues.md) | Asserts evidential status without earning it | "This systematic failure may itself be diagnostic of something about consciousness's nature" |
| "the sieve that filters out sand cannot then be used to study sand" (galilean-exclusion.md) | Analogy hides the key issue: neuroscience *does* study consciousness despite the exclusion | Acknowledge that the analogy is partial, or note that the sieve can study sand's effects on other materials |
| "The Map favours the second interpretation" (theoretical-virtues.md) | This is the site's voice, but the preference is asserted without sufficient argument over the first interpretation | Add 1-2 sentences explaining *why* the second interpretation is preferred |
| "Real control requires real selection among genuinely exclusive alternatives" (control-theoretic-will.md) | Begs the question against MWI | "Control, as ordinarily understood, requires that the controller's signal determines a single outcome" |

## Strengths (Brief)

Despite the criticisms above, these articles display several qualities worth preserving:

**Galilean exclusion** is the most philosophically precise of the five. The distinction between methodological exclusion and metaphysical absence is well-drawn and genuinely illuminating. The point that "Galileo did not discover that secondary qualities are unreal — he decided to exclude them" is a strong formulation that deserves to be the centrepiece of the Map's methodology articles.

**Valence** provides an unusually concrete concept page. The treatment of pain asymbolia grounds abstract philosophical claims in clinical evidence. Even if the interpretation is overclaimed (as noted above), the engagement with empirical literature is stronger than in most Map concept articles.

**Control-theoretic will** is ambitious and genuinely novel in the context of the Map's content. The five control operations (gating, stabilisation, veto, attractor steering, resource allocation) provide a useful taxonomy even if the ontological conclusions are contested. The "What Control-Theoretic Will Is Not" section shows laudable awareness of potential misreadings.

**Convergence arguments** addresses a genuine gap in the Map's epistemological foundations. The three conditions (independence, robustness, specificity) provide a useful framework for self-criticism, even though the article doesn't apply them as ruthlessly to the Map's own convergence claims as it should.

**Theoretical virtues** is the most intellectually bold of the five. The thesis — that the entire toolkit of theory-selection malfunctions for consciousness — is striking and, if properly argued, could be a distinctive contribution. The article's structure (systematic catalogue of each virtue's failure) is well-organised and clear.
