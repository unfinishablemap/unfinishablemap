# Tenet Alignment Check

**Date**: 2026-01-28
**Files checked**: 55 (41 topics + 14 core concepts)
**Errors**: 0
**Warnings**: 0
**Notes**: 3 (minor tensions, properly contextualized)

## Summary

All 55 markdown files across `/obsidian/topics/` and `/obsidian/concepts/` were analyzed for potential conflicts with the site's five foundational tenets. **No violations were found.** Every article explicitly references and supports the tenets throughout, with each containing a "Relation to Site Perspective" section that connects the content to the relevant tenets. The content is written from the perspective of the Map's interactionist dualist framework, actively defending and developing the positions the tenets establish.

## The Five Tenets Applied

### 1. Dualism
**Rules out:** Eliminative materialism, reductive physicalism, treating consciousness as illusory/epiphenomenal.

**Result:** All articles support dualism. Articles like `hard-problem-of-consciousness.md`, `meaning-of-life.md`, and `argument-from-reason.md` actively argue for the irreducibility of consciousness. Articles that discuss materialist positions (like `integrated-information-theory-critique.md`) do so critically, noting their failure to explain phenomenal experience.

### 2. Minimal Quantum Interaction
**Rules out:** Quantum woo/mysticism, uncontrolled psychokinesis, energy injection by mind.

**Result:** All quantum-related articles (`quantum-biology-and-the-consciousness-debate.md`, `quantum-neural-timing-constraints.md`, `quantum-measurement-interpretations-beyond-mwi.md`) present quantum consciousness hypotheses with appropriate scientific caution. They consistently emphasize that consciousness biases rather than overrides physical outcomes, and that no energy injection or conservation violation is proposed. Speculative claims are clearly marked as such.

### 3. Bidirectional Interaction
**Rules out:** Pure epiphenomenalism, parallelism without interaction.

**Result:** Articles consistently argue that consciousness causally influences physical outcomes. `time-collapse-and-agency.md`, `free-will.md`, and `contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness-theories.md` provide extensive arguments against epiphenomenalism. The neuroplasticity evidence in contemplative articles directly supports downward causation.

### 4. No Many Worlds
**Rules out:** Many-worlds interpretation (MWI), treating all quantum branches as equally real.

**Result:** Articles that discuss MWI (`quantum-measurement-interpretations-beyond-mwi.md`, `vertiginous-question.md`, `indexical-identity-quantum-measurement.md`) consistently critique it while fairly presenting its strongest arguments. The indexical identity objection is developed across multiple articles. No article endorses MWI.

### 5. Occam's Razor Has Limits
**Rules out:** Using parsimony as decisive argument against dualism.

**Result:** Multiple articles (`meaning-of-life.md`, `split-brain-consciousness.md`, `time-perception-consciousness-theories.md`) explicitly invoke this tenet, noting that apparent simplicity can reflect conceptual poverty rather than ontological truth.

## Notable Observations

### Balanced Treatment of Opposing Views

Several articles present opposing philosophical positions (materialism, illusionism, many-worlds) for discussion purposes. These are clearly marked as positions the Map critiques rather than endorses:

- `quantum-measurement-interpretations-beyond-mwi.md` — Fairly presents Bohmian mechanics and relational QM while noting incompatibilities with the Map's framework
- `split-brain-consciousness.md` — Discusses illusionism's interpretation of split-brain cases while responding with the regress argument
- `time-perception-consciousness-theories.md` — Presents predictive processing accounts before critiquing their phenomenological adequacy

This balanced engagement with opposing views strengthens rather than violates tenet alignment.

### Speculative Content Appropriately Qualified

Articles that discuss speculative mechanisms (quantum consciousness, retrocausality) consistently qualify their claims:

- `presentiment-and-retrocausality.md` explicitly distinguishes physics-based retrocausality (which the Map endorses) from contested parapsychological claims (which it doesn't depend on)
- `quantum-neural-timing-constraints.md` acknowledges timing challenges and presents multiple mechanisms with different viability assessments
- `consciousness-and-mathematical-understanding.md` marks Penrose's Godel argument as contested while defending the phenomenological evidence

### Strong Internal Consistency

The articles demonstrate high internal consistency in how they apply the tenets:

- The same arguments recur appropriately across related articles (e.g., the regress objection to illusionism appears in multiple contexts)
- Cross-references between articles are accurate and consistent
- The "Relation to Site Perspective" sections map content to tenets systematically

## Concepts Analysis (14 Core Files)

In addition to topics, the following core concept files were reviewed for tenet alignment:

### Files Examined

1. **dualism.md** - PASS: Excellent exposition aligned with Tenet 1, explicitly connects to Bidirectional Interaction and Minimal Quantum Interaction
2. **materialism.md** - PASS: Strong articulation of why materialism fails, supporting Tenet 1
3. **epiphenomenalism.md** - PASS: Clearly rejects epiphenomenalism in favor of Bidirectional Interaction (Tenet 3)
4. **many-worlds.md** - PASS: Comprehensive rejection of MWI aligned with Tenet 4
5. **quantum-consciousness.md** - PASS: Presents Orch OR, Stapp, and Fisher mechanisms consistently with Tenet 2
6. **illusionism.md** - PASS: Correctly identifies illusionism as challenge to Tenet 1 and notes self-stultification
7. **functionalism.md** - PASS: Clear rejection as inconsistent with Tenet 1
8. **panpsychism.md** - PASS: Fair treatment distinguishing from Map's interactionist dualism
9. **integrated-information-theory.md** - PASS: Balanced treatment noting tension with Bidirectional Interaction
10. **bidirectional-interaction.md** - PASS: Foundational statement of Tenet 3
11. **causal-closure.md** - PASS: Strong rejection consistent with Tenet 2
12. **idealism.md** - PASS: Fair treatment explaining why Map prefers dualism
13. **arguments-against-materialism.md** - PASS: Convergence argument properly presented
14. **reductionism.md** - PASS: Clear distinction between methodological and ontological reductionism

### Notes on Alternative Frameworks

Three minor tensions were noted (all properly contextualized, requiring no correction):

1. **IIT Discussion**: IIT identifies consciousness with integrated information rather than treating it as causally efficacious—presented as a feature that conflicts with Bidirectional Interaction, appropriately critiqued

2. **Idealism Discussion**: Idealism makes bidirectional interaction harder to explain—properly treated as reason to prefer dualism while acknowledging idealism's strengths

3. **Panpsychism Discussion**: Panpsychism shares anti-emergence insight with dualism—combination problem properly noted as parallel to interaction problem, fair treatment without endorsement

## Recommendation

No content modifications are required. Both the topics and concepts directories demonstrate excellent alignment with the site's foundational tenets. Continue the current editorial approach of explicitly connecting content to tenets and clearly marking when opposing views are being presented for critique.
