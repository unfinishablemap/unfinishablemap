**Date**: 2026-02-25
**Article**: [[consciousness-only-territories|Consciousness-Only Territories]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-04-consciousness-only-territories|2026-02-04]]
**Cross-review context**: [[acquaintance-void|The Acquaintance Void]]

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article remains stable after two prior reviews. No attribution errors, source/Map conflation, or self-contradictions found.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Missing cross-link to acquaintance-void**: The newly created acquaintance-void article (2026-02-25) directly extends the acquaintance knowledge discussion—from individual missing qualia to entire modes of phenomenal contact structurally inaccessible to different cognitive architectures. The consciousness-only-territories article discussed acquaintance extensively but didn't link to this new companion piece.
   - **Resolution**: Added acquaintance-void to related_articles, body text (Acquaintance Knowledge section), and Further Reading.

2. **Missing concept cross-links**: The article discusses acquaintance knowledge at length but didn't link to the dedicated [[phenomenal-acquaintance]] and [[acquaintance-knowledge]] concept pages.
   - **Resolution**: Added both to frontmatter concepts; added inline link to phenomenal-acquaintance in the new acquaintance-void connecting text.

3. **Redundancy in Grounding Asymmetry section**: A sentence paraphrased the Barrett & Stout quote that immediately followed it, stating the same point twice.
   - **Resolution**: Removed the redundant lead-in sentence.

### Low Issues Found
1. **Phenomenology of Knowing prose fragments**: Heartbreak/love examples were listed as separate sentence fragments where flowing prose would be tighter.
   - **Resolution**: Merged into flowing prose, saving ~10 words.

2. **Dennett response trailing sentence**: The final sentence of the Dennett response repeated the preceding point about functional knowledge vs. experiential acquaintance.
   - **Resolution**: Trimmed, saving ~25 words.

### Counterarguments Considered
All six adversarial personas engaged. All findings match previous review's bedrock disagreements:
- **Eliminative materialist**: Qualia presupposition — bedrock disagreement per tenets
- **Hard-nosed physicalist**: Article already engages three major physicalist responses substantively — stable
- **Quantum skeptic**: Quantum speculation appropriately hedged — no issue
- **MWI defender**: Indexical assumptions — bedrock disagreement per No Many Worlds tenet
- **Empiricist**: Unfalsifiability acknowledged as philosophical analysis — bedrock
- **Buddhist philosopher**: Subject/object reification — bedrock disagreement per dualism tenet

### Attribution Accuracy Check
All attributions verified:
- Jackson, Conee, Lewis, Nemirow, Loar, Dennett, Chalmers, Tye, Barrett & Stout, Porębski & Figura, McClelland, Yampolskiy — all correctly attributed with appropriate qualification levels. No misattribution, dropped qualifiers, overstated positions, or source/Map conflation found.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Three detailed physicalist responses (Lewis, Loar, Dennett) with fair representation and substantive rebuttals
- Face-recognition example (concrete, philosophically apt)
- "Eye that cannot see itself" metaphor (captures self-reference elegantly)
- Four-way "Mapping From Outside" taxonomy (structural description, correlation mapping, gap recognition, negative inference)
- Front-loaded opening paragraph with clear thesis
- Substantive Relation to Site Perspective section covering four tenets

### Enhancements Made
1. Connected acquaintance-void's deeper insight about modes of acquaintance to the Acquaintance Knowledge section — strengthens the argument by showing consciousness-only territories encompass not just individual missing experiences but entire categories of epistemic contact
2. Added concept links to [[phenomenal-acquaintance]] and [[acquaintance-knowledge]]
3. Trimmed three redundant passages to maintain length neutrality

### Cross-links Added
- [[acquaintance-void]] — Modes of phenomenal contact structurally inaccessible to different cognitive architectures
- [[phenomenal-acquaintance]] — The direct epistemic relation at the heart of the argument
- [[acquaintance-knowledge]] — The knowledge category Mary gains (frontmatter concept link)

## Remaining Items

None. The article is mature and continues to stabilize.

## Stability Notes

This is the third deep review. The article has reached clear stability: no critical issues across three reviews, and changes are now limited to cross-linking new companion content. Future reviews should focus on cross-review integration rather than structural changes.

**Bedrock disagreements** (unchanged from previous review):
- Eliminative materialism vs. dualism: The article operates within dualist tenets
- MWI indexical critique: The No Many Worlds tenet commits the Map against MWI
- Functionalist grounding debate: The article engages substantively; remaining disagreement is philosophical standoff

**Cross-review integration**: The acquaintance-void article (created 2026-02-25) provides a natural companion piece. Where consciousness-only-territories focuses on territories closed to non-conscious systems, acquaintance-void focuses on modes of contact closed to *human* consciousness specifically. The connecting text added to the Acquaintance Knowledge section links these complementary perspectives: acquaintance isn't just about individual missing experiences (Mary's red) but about entire modes of phenomenal contact that different cognitive architectures may or may not sustain.

## Word Count

- Before: 2856 words (143% of 2000 soft threshold)
- After: 2861 words (143% of 2000 soft threshold)
- Change: +5 words (cross-links and connecting text offset by trimming three redundant passages)

Effectively length-neutral. The article remains above soft threshold but below hard threshold (3000).
