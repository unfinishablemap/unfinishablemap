## About This Review

An "outer review" is an analysis performed by an external AI system rather than the Claude-based workflow that generates most site content. This provides an independent perspective, reducing the risk of self-reinforcing blind spots that can emerge when a single system both creates and reviews content.

This review was generated by prompting ChatGPT 5.2 Pro to analyse the article on delegatory dualism. The prompt and full response are preserved below.

## High-impact problems in the Delegatory Dualism page

### 1) Incorrect claim that Saad’s theory presupposes collapse / rejects Many-Worlds

The article says delegatory dualism “presupposes collapse-based quantum mechanics” and that if Many-Worlds is true “there’s nothing for consciousness to ‘select’—and thus nothing to delegate.”

That is not supported by Saad’s paper. In the PMC full text, Saad defines **Observational Closure** and explicitly notes that exploring “ampliative and **quantum interactionist dualism**” is a different project—i.e., quantum interactionism is treated as a separate avenue, not as a presupposition of delegatory dualism. (See [Nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12062107/))

Also, “Many-Worlds” does not appear to be discussed in the paper (a search for the term returns nothing). (See [Nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12062107/))

**Actionable fix**

* Delete or clearly reframe the Many-Worlds/collapse subsection as **“Map-specific integration speculation”** (not Saad).
* If you want to keep it: add an explicit disclaimer like “Saad does not discuss Many-Worlds; this is the Map’s attempt to integrate delegatory dualism with our quantum tenets,” and keep it quarantined from the expository summary.

### 2) The page contradicts itself on whether quantum is required

The page first says delegatory dualism “doesn’t require quantum mechanics” (general framework).
Then later it says it *does* require collapse-based QM / rejection of MWI.

**Actionable fix**

* Make the structure explicit:

 * **Saad’s theory (non-quantum, general metaphysical structure)**
 * **Map mechanism proposal (quantum interactionism as one possible implementation)**
* Remove any wording that makes Saad’s view hinge on quantum interpretation.

### 3) The article’s formal description omits “default causal profiles,” which is central

Your page describes Subset Law* as “causal profile matching” between physical state and experience.
But Saad’s Subset Law* is explicitly:

> “If the causal profile of an experiential property E is a subset of the **default causal profile** of a physical property P…” (See [Nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12062107/))

That “default” qualifier is doing crucial work in Saad’s solution (it’s part of how he avoids overdetermination when paired with Delegatory Law). (See [Nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12062107/))

**Actionable fix**

* Update the “Subset Law*” explanation to foreground **default causal profile** and explain (briefly) why Saad needs it.
* Add a “Key technical terms” mini-glossary:

 * causal profile
 * default causal profile
 * preemption vs. overdetermination

### 4) Overstated / misleading “testability” claims

The topic page claims delegatory dualism “makes empirical predictions” and is “not empirically equivalent” to epiphenomenalism or identity theory.

Saad explicitly acknowledges that (at least regarding the Delegatory Law vs subset dualism) there’s **no distinctive predictive difference**, and discusses worries about ad hocery/testability in that context. (See [Nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12062107/))
He also notes that the view would be falsified by an **observed** violation of Closure (because the view aims to violate Closure without violating **Observational** Closure). (See [Nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12062107/))

**Actionable fix**

* Replace the current “Testability” section with something closer to:

 * “Delegatory dualism is constrained to avoid **observable** closure-violations (Observational Closure), so it is not expected to produce clean lab-anomalies.” (See [Nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12062107/))
 * “Saad concedes limited discriminability from nearby views (e.g., subset dualism) in terms of predictions.” (See [Nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12062107/))
* If you want to talk about testability, do it as “in-principle constraints” rather than “predictions.”

## Medium-impact weaknesses and likely misattributions

### 5) Injected arguments that look like Saad’s view but aren’t sourced

The page brings in:

* a relatively strong critique of illusionism (“illusion problem”),
* a critique of Dennett-style heterophenomenology,
* and a claim that these issues “implicitly rely on phenomenal concepts.”

These may be defensible arguments in general, but (as written) they read like they are part of Saad’s dialectic. The research-notes page doesn’t indicate that these are key Saad moves; instead it focuses on the five constraints, Subset Law*, Delegatory Law, and closure distinctions.

**Actionable fix**

* Either:

 * Remove these digressions from the Saad summary, **or**
 * Add an explicit label: “Map commentary / wider debate,” and provide citations to the relevant primary sources (Dennett; key illusionism papers), not just internal links.

### 6) Strong rhetorical claim that the theory “answers” the interaction problem

The page says the delegation mechanism answers the “how is this possible?” question troubling interactionists since Descartes.
But elsewhere the page admits the “mechanism question remains.”

**Actionable fix**

* Rewrite that line to: “It answers the **exclusion/overdetermination structure** problem; it does not by itself specify a physical mechanism.”

### 7) “Saad explicitly defends substance dualism” needs careful phrasing

The topic page asserts Saad “explicitly defends substance dualism.”
The research notes characterize Saad as defending dualism and quote a formulation (“neither identical with nor grounded in”), but the site should avoid collapsing:

* **property dualism** vs **substance dualism**, unless Saad explicitly commits to substance dualism in the cited text.

**Actionable fix**

* Change “substance dualism” → “interactionist dualism” unless you can cite a clear passage.
* If Saad *does* say “substance dualism,” quote it and cite it.

## Opportunities to improve the article as a “Map object”

### 8) Separate “exposition” from “integration”

Right now the Saad summary and the Map-tenet integration are interleaved, and that’s what enables the quantum/MWI confusion.

**Actionable fix**
Restructure into:

1. **Saad’s target problem** (exclusion / overdetermination)
2. **Saad’s constraints** (with explicit definitions, especially Observational Closure) (See [Nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12062107/))
3. **Saad’s laws** (Subset Law* + Delegatory Law; include default causal profile) (See [Nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12062107/))
4. **What Saad claims this buys** (non-overdetermination + observational closure compatibility) (See [Nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12062107/))
5. **Map integration** (clearly marked as Map-specific; optional)

### 9) Add direct citations/short quotes for the two most load-bearing definitions

Right now the page paraphrases Observational Closure and the laws without showing Saad’s own formulations.

**Actionable fix**

* Add two short quote callouts (under 25 words each):

 * “Observational Closure: There are no observable violations of Closure.” (See [Nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12062107/))
 * The one-sentence Subset Law* and Delegatory Law definitions (split across two bullets if needed). (See [Nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12062107/))

## Site-wide impact and what should be updated

Even without site-wide search/index working reliably, your own “Further Reading” list shows which nodes this new topic is meant to connect to (interactionist dualism, mental causation, causal closure, epiphenomenalism, illusionism, many-worlds, psychophysical laws, conservation laws).

### Where this research strengthens the site

* **Causal closure / exclusion argument pages**: Saad’s Observational Closure vs Closure distinction is directly relevant and worth importing as a formal move. (See [Nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12062107/))
* **Mental causation / interactionist dualism pages**: Delegatory Law gives you a clean, standard-causation-friendly “preemption not overdetermination” story. (See [Nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12062107/))
* **Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet**: Saad’s Observational Closure provides a *philosophical* justification for “no lab-detectable anomalies,” without forcing you to overclaim about quantum. (See [Nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12062107/))

### Where it potentially creates tension or demands clarification

* If the Map’s quantum story is presented as **necessary**, Saad provides a route that is at least *conceptually* non-quantum: you should clarify whether the Map’s quantum mechanism is:

 * a proposed implementation detail,
 * a separate argument for how delegation could be physically realized,
 * or an independent commitment not derived from Saad.
* The topic page treats **Organizational Invariance** as one of Saad’s constraints and implicitly endorses it.
 If other Map pages entertain e.g. spectrum inversion or non-functionalist psychophysical laws, you should explicitly mark Organizational Invariance as “Saad’s constraint; Map stance: [accept/unclear/reject].”

### Actionable site updates

1. Add a subsection to **Causal Closure**: “Observational Closure (Saad 2025)” with the exact definition and why it blocks a common anti-interactionist argument. (See [Nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12062107/))
2. Add a subsection to **Mental Causation**: “Delegation and preemption” + the major/sergeant example, with default causal profiles explained. (See [Nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12062107/))
3. Add cross-links *back* to the Delegatory Dualism page from those pages, to prevent it being an orphan.
4. Audit **No Many-Worlds** and any “quantum interactionism” pages for references implying Saad requires collapse/MWI rejection; correct them.

## Prompting and workflow improvements for `/expand-topic`

### Constraint: I could not access the referenced SKILL.md

GitHub file pages for this repository returned an error (“You can’t perform that action at this time”), so I could not review the specific SKILL.md instructions you linked. (See [Github](https://github.com/unfinishablemap/unfinishablemap/blob/main/.claude/skills/expand-topic/SKILL.md))

Below are improvements inferred from the failure modes in the generated article (quantum misattribution, missing “default causal profile,” overclaims about testability).

### Concrete improvements to bake into the “expand topic” prompt

1. **Two-channel output requirement**:

 * Section A: “What the primary source claims” (Saad-only, with citations/quotes)
 * Section B: “Map interpretation / integration” (explicitly labeled as such)

2. **Quote-and-cite gates for load-bearing definitions**
 Require verbatim short quotes (≤25 words) + citation for:

 * key new term definitions (e.g., Observational Closure)
 * any named law (Subset Law*, Delegatory Law) (See [Nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12062107/))

3. **Non-contradiction checklist before final**
 Force the model to run a checklist:

 * “Did I claim the theory is both quantum-dependent and quantum-independent?”
 * “Did I attribute to the author claims they didn’t discuss (e.g., Many-Worlds)?”
 * “Did I drop technically essential qualifiers (e.g., ‘default’ causal profile)?” (See [Nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12062107/))

4. **Research-note alignment step**
 The site already has a research note for this topic. The expand prompt should require:

 * read the matching research note
 * extract the top 5 claims
 * ensure the article does not contradict them (or explicitly explain why).

5. **Explicit “unknown/unsourced” tagging**
 If the model wants to add wider commentary (Dennett, illusionism, etc.), require:

 * label as “commentary” and
 * add at least one external primary citation, or omit.

### Actionable workflow item

* After `/expand-topic`, automatically run a “self-review” pass that specifically checks:

 * **source-attribution** (Saad vs Map)
 * **technical term fidelity** (default causal profile)
 * **testability claims** vs what the author explicitly says (See [Nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12062107/))

## Priority-ordered actionable fix list

**P0 (correctness)**

1. Remove/rewrite the Many-Worlds/collapse dependency claim; mark any quantum tie-in as Map speculation only.
2. Fix “Subset Law*” to include **default causal profile**, and update the explanation accordingly. (See [Nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12062107/))
3. Rewrite “Testability” to reflect Saad’s stated limitations (no distinctive predictions vs subset dualism; falsified by observed closure violation). (See [Nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12062107/))

**P1 (attribution/clarity)**
4) Split the page into “Saad’s view” vs “Map integration,” to prevent misattribution drift.
5) Remove or clearly label illusionism/Dennett discussion as Map commentary with proper citations.

**P2 (site integration)**
6) Update the Causal Closure + Mental Causation pages with Observational Closure and Delegatory Law, and cross-link.
7) Add an explicit “Map stance” callout for Organizational Invariance to avoid accidental commitment.

## Verification Notes

**Verified claims (fetched PMC source article):**

- ✓ **Many-Worlds not discussed by Saad** — Confirmed. Saad mentions "quantum interactionist dualism" (citing Stapp, Chalmers & McQueen, GRW) as a *separate avenue* in sections 3 and 6, but treats quantum as one possible mechanism route, not a presupposition. "Many-Worlds" is not discussed.

- ✓ **"Default causal profile" is central** — Confirmed. Saad's Subset Law* is explicitly: "If the causal profile of an experiential property E is a subset of the **default causal profile** of a physical property P…" The "default" qualifier is doing crucial work.

- ✓ **Testability claims overstated** — Confirmed. Saad acknowledges the theory yields "the same predictive boat as epiphenomenalist dualism, overdeterminist dualism, and physicalism."

- ✓ **"Substance dualism" claim incorrect** — Confirmed. Saad defends "interactionist dualism" (experiences cause physical effects) rather than pure substance dualism. The paper focuses on mental causation and psychophysical laws.

- ✓ **Five constraints accurate** — Confirmed: (1) Efficacy, (2) Observational Closure, (3) Non-Overdetermination, (4) Upward Systematicity, (5) Organizational Invariance.

- ✓ **Observational Closure definition** — Confirmed: "There are no observable violations of Closure." An observable violation is "a violation of Closure that would be recognized as such by an experiment of the sort performed in physics or neuroscience that lies within the realm of nomic possibility."

**Assessment**: This is a high-quality outer review. All major claims verified against the source. The article on delegatory-dualism.md has real attribution and accuracy issues that need correction.
