# Deep Review: Mysterianism and Cognitive Closure

**Date**: 2026-01-20
**File**: obsidian/concepts/mysterianism.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **No falsifiability section**: The article acknowledged uncertainty about whether limits are real but provided no testable conditions. Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section with five specific conditions that would undermine mysterianism.

### Medium Issues Found
- **No engagement with illusionism**: The article mentioned illusionism briefly but didn't engage with the dialectic between mysterianism and illusionism as opposing responses to the hard problem. Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section.
- **No process philosophy perspective**: Recent deep reviews have added Whitehead sections; this was missing. Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" connecting Whitehead's actual occasions to mysterian themes.
- **Incomplete tenet coverage**: Only addressed 3 of 5 tenets. Expanded "Relation to Site Perspective" to cover all five tenets explicitly.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Illusionist response to mysterianism**: Addressed with counter-argument about infinite regress and interpretation of illusionism as cognitive closure symptom.
- **Dennett's defeatism objection**: Already present and adequately addressed.
- **Vitalism analogy**: Already present and adequately addressed.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent treatment of Nagel's bat and its relation to mysterianism
- The phenomenology-of-the-edge connection is distinctive and well-developed
- The C. elegans empirical example effectively grounds theoretical claims
- Clear presentation of McGinn's cognitive closure concept
- Well-structured flow from concept to implications to site connection

### Enhancements Made
1. Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section engaging with Frankish/Dennett position and providing mysterian counter-argument
2. Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section with Whitehead's actual occasions as compatible framework
3. Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section with five falsifiability conditions
4. Expanded "Relation to Site Perspective" to address all five tenets explicitly, including quantum mechanism
5. Added 3 new entries to Further Reading (combination-problem, introspection, decoherence)
6. Added 4 new references (Chomsky, Frankish, Tallis, Whitehead)

### Cross-links Added
- [[illusionism]] — Added to concepts and discussed in new section
- [[combination-problem]] — Added to concepts and Further Reading
- [[introspection]] — Added to concepts and Further Reading
- [[decoherence]] — Added to concepts and Further Reading

## Remaining Items

None. All critical and medium issues have been addressed. The article now includes:
- Comprehensive tenet coverage
- Falsifiability conditions
- Engagement with illusionism challenge
- Process philosophy perspective
- Enhanced cross-linking
