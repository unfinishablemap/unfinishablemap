**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Article**: [[semantic-memory|Semantic Memory and Noetic Consciousness]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-20-semantic-memory|2026-01-20]]

## Review Outcome: Stable

This article has reached stability after the comprehensive improvements made in the 2026-01-20 review. No content changes are required.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Heterophenomenology engagement**: A Dennettian could argue the regress argument doesn't succeed because heterophenomenology explains "seeming to experience" without requiring genuine experience. However, the illusionist challenge section (added in previous review) already addresses this adequately. **Status**: Already handled.

### Low Issues Found
- **Falsifiability condition 5 vagueness**: The condition about "LLM metacognition proving equivalent" could specify what would count as "genuine" TOT-like states vs. functional mimicry. **Status**: Minor refinement opportunity; not worth expanding given length constraints.

### Counterarguments Considered
All six adversarial personas engaged:
1. **Eliminative Materialist**: TOT/FOK could be brain states we mislabel — addressed by illusionist challenge section
2. **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: Introspection is question-begging — article acknowledges this tension
3. **Quantum Skeptic**: Speculative mechanisms — article appropriately hedges and doesn't hang arguments on them
4. **Many-Worlds Defender**: Indexical argument contested — this is a bedrock disagreement per the Map's tenets
5. **Empiricist**: Falsifiability conditions present and reasonable
6. **Buddhist Philosopher**: Contemplative evidence section engages tradition

### Attribution Check
PASS — All attributions verified:
- Tulving's three forms of consciousness correctly attributed
- PCT linked appropriately without over-attribution
- Whitehead's terminology used correctly
- Illusionism correctly attributed to Dennett and Frankish
- Tallis quote referenced

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent opening that front-loads the key concept with concrete example
- Strong TOT/FOK phenomenological analysis with empirical grounding
- Well-developed PCT section bridging meaning and phenomenology
- Illuminating automatic vs. conscious processing distinction
- Effective LLM contrast highlighting what's missing in computational approaches
- Comprehensive illusionist challenge section with three-part response
- Contemplative evidence providing independent support
- Process philosophy perspective grounding noetic prehension
- Falsifiability section with specific conditions
- All five tenets covered with substantive connections

### Enhancements Made
None required — article is well-developed.

### Cross-links Status
Article has 16 cross-links in Further Reading, plus 7 concept links in frontmatter. Adequate coverage.

## Length Analysis

- **Word count**: 3094 words
- **Threshold**: 2500 (soft), 3500 (hard) for concepts/
- **Status**: Soft warning (124% of soft threshold)
- **Action**: Length-neutral mode. No expansions made. Article is comprehensive but not bloated.

## Remaining Items

None. All critical and medium issues from the previous review were addressed. The article has reached a stable state where further review would produce oscillation rather than improvement.

## Stability Notes

This article represents a mature treatment of semantic memory and noetic consciousness from the Map's dualist perspective. Key philosophical disagreements are acknowledged as such:

- **Illusionism**: The article presents the illusionist challenge fairly and offers three responses. Illusionists will remain unconvinced; this is a fundamental philosophical dispute, not a flaw to fix.
- **MWI**: The indexical argument against many-worlds assumes the problematic nature of branching. MWI defenders will object. This is a bedrock disagreement reflecting the Map's fifth tenet.
- **Quantum mechanisms**: The article appropriately hedges on quantum selection, presenting it as possibility rather than established mechanism. Quantum skeptics will object even to the mention; the Map's tenets require this connection but the article doesn't depend on it.

Future reviews should note this stability. The article needs re-review only if:
1. New research challenges the empirical claims about TOT/FOK
2. The Map's framework on cognitive phenomenology shifts
3. Significant external criticism identifies errors not caught here
