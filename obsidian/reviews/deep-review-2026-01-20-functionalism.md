**Date**: 2026-01-20
**Article**: [[concepts/functionalism|Against Functionalism]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Missing engagement with illusionism**: The strongest physicalist response was entirely absent. The article attacked functionalism without addressing the most radical defence: that phenomenal properties don't exist.
   - **Resolution**: Added comprehensive "The Illusionist Challenge" section with regress response, introspection analysis, and contemplative evidence.

2. **Incomplete tenet coverage**: Only 3 of 5 tenets addressed in Relation to Site Perspective section.
   - **Resolution**: Expanded to cover all 5 tenets with substantive analysis (Minimal Quantum Interaction, No Many Worlds, Occam's Razor Has Limits).

3. **No falsifiability section**: Article didn't identify what would challenge the anti-functionalist view.
   - **Resolution**: Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section with 5 specific conditions.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **No process philosophy perspective**: Given other deep-reviewed articles include Whitehead's framework, this was a gap.
   - **Resolution**: Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section covering concrescence, actual occasions, and haecceity.

2. **No contemplative evidence**: The article relied entirely on thought experiments without phenomenological data.
   - **Resolution**: Added "Contemplative Evidence" section connecting to witness consciousness and mental effort.

3. **Missing cross-links**: Key related concepts (illusionism, introspection, witness-consciousness, haecceity, decoherence, continual-learning-argument) not linked.
   - **Resolution**: Added 9 new concept links in frontmatter and wikilinks throughout text.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Illusionist regress**: Addressed through three responses (regress, introspection reliability, contemplative evidence)
- **Conceivability objection**: Preserved original response but noted it could be challenged
- **Scientific fruitfulness**: Preserved original response distinguishing utility from truth

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Five-argument structure (Absent Qualia, Inverted Qualia, Chinese Room, Multiple Realizability, Explanatory Gap)
- Clear logical premises and conclusions for each argument
- China Brain and Inverted Earth examples
- Measured, philosophical tone in objections/responses section
- Strong opening that frontloads the core claim

### Enhancements Made

1. **The Illusionist Challenge** section (new): Comprehensive engagement with eliminativism including regress response, introspection analysis, and contemplative counterevidence
2. **Process Philosophy Perspective** section (new): Whitehead's framework explaining why function can't generate experience, concrescence, haecceity connection
3. **Contemplative Evidence** section (new): Witness consciousness and mental effort as phenomenological data against functionalism
4. **What Would Challenge This View?** section (new): 5 falsifiability conditions
5. **Expanded Relation to Site Perspective**: From 3 to all 5 tenets with substantive connections
6. **Enhanced Further Reading**: From 6 to 15 site links, improved citation format for external sources

### Cross-links Added

New wikilinks to:
- [[illusionism]] — radical physicalist response
- [[introspection]] — reliability of phenomenal access
- [[witness-consciousness]] — contemplative evidence
- [[haecceity]] — particularity vs. functional equivalence
- [[decoherence]] — quantum coherence objection
- [[continual-learning-argument]] — AI consciousness criterion
- [[mental-effort]] — phenomenology functionalism misses
- [[mysterianism]] — cognitive closure alternative
- [[concepts/epiphenomenalism]] — rejected by Map's framework

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues addressed in this review.

## Metrics

- Word count increased: ~2400 → ~5200 (substantial enhancement)
- New sections added: 4 major sections
- Cross-links added: 9 new concept links
- External references added: 3 (Frankish 2016, Whitehead 1929, Hoel 2026)
