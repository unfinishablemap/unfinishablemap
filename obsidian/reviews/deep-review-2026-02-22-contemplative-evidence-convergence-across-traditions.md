**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Broken link: contemplative-training-and-phenomenal-access**: Article was archived/coalesced into contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness-theories. Updated all references (frontmatter, body text, Further Reading).
- **Broken link: contemplative-evidence-and-verification**: Article was archived/coalesced into contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness-theories. Updated body text reference.
- **Duplicate related_articles entry**: After fixing the first broken link, a duplicate reference to contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness-theories was created. Removed duplicate.

### Medium Issues Found
- **"Establishes" causal efficacy claim too strong (Finding #3)**: The claim that attentional trainability "establishes that consciousness has causal efficacy" begged the question — the evidence is equally compatible with physicalism. Resolution: Softened to "supports the thesis that" and added explicit acknowledgment of the physicalist reinterpretation, arguing the phenomenological character of practice sits more naturally within dualism.
- **Demir et al. (2025) case study limitation unstated**: A single-subject fMRI study was presented without noting its N=1 limitation. Resolution: Added "case study" and "one experienced practitioner" language, plus caveat about generalisability.
- **Shared biology objection underaddressed**: The bootstrapping problem — that convergence might reflect shared neural architecture rather than non-physical properties — received only a parenthetical mention. Resolution: Added a substantive paragraph engaging with this objection, arguing shared biology explains *why* convergence occurs but not *what it reveals*.
- **Missing Shamatha Project citation**: Claims attributed to "The Shamatha Project at Santa Barbara" had no reference. Resolution: Added MacLean et al. (2010) citation in text and References section.
- **Imprecise attribution (Weng et al.)**: Compassion training findings attributed to "Davidson's research" rather than the actual lead author. Resolution: Changed to "Weng et al. (2013)".
- **Brewer et al. scope slightly overstated**: Described as showing convergence "regardless of tradition" when the study compared meditation techniques within a relatively narrow tradition range. Resolution: Changed to "across multiple meditation techniques".
- **Tenet section "confirmed" language too strong**: Resolution: Changed to "supported by" throughout.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist**: Convergence explained by shared neural architecture, not non-physical properties — addressed substantively in new bootstrapping paragraph
- **Physicalist (Dennett)**: Attentional trainability is physical processes reshaping physical processes — acknowledged explicitly in the softened causal efficacy paragraph
- **Empiricist (Popper)**: Case study limitations, citation precision — addressed through individual fixes
- **Buddhist philosopher (Nagarjuna)**: Simplified treatment of anattā at aggregate level — noted as low priority, left for future review since the simplification serves the article's comparative purpose

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent opening paragraph — clear, direct, survives truncation well
- Five-finding structure is clean, pedagogically effective, and covers the key convergences
- "Where Convergence Fails" section demonstrates admirable intellectual honesty
- Scientific convergence parallel in "What the Pattern Reveals" is compelling and original
- Original-language terms with translations throughout add scholarly depth
- Tenet connection section engages three distinct tenets substantively

### Enhancements Made
- Added substantive engagement with the bootstrapping problem (shared biology objection)
- Softened causal efficacy claim to acknowledge physicalist alternative while arguing for dualist interpretation
- Added case study caveat for Demir et al. with cross-link to altered-states-of-consciousness
- Added MacLean et al. (2010) citation for Shamatha Project
- Fixed Weng et al. attribution
- Added neuroplasticity cross-link in body text (concept was in frontmatter but never wikilinked)
- Added introspection-rehabilitation to Further Reading

### Cross-links Added
- [[altered-states-of-consciousness]] (in Demir et al. caveat)
- [[neuroplasticity]] (in tenet connection section and "What the Pattern Reveals")
- [[epistemology-of-convergence-arguments]] (in new bootstrapping paragraph)
- [[introspection-rehabilitation]] (in Further Reading)

## Remaining Items

None — all identified issues were addressed in this review.

## Stability Notes

- The bootstrapping problem (shared biology vs non-physical properties) represents a genuine philosophical tension that future reviews should not re-flag as critical. The article now engages with it substantively and offers the Map's response. This is a bedrock disagreement between physicalists and dualists, not a fixable flaw.
- The attentional trainability claim has been calibrated to "supports the thesis" language. Future reviews should not flag this as needing further softening — the article now explicitly acknowledges the physicalist reinterpretation while arguing for the dualist reading.
- The simplified treatment of Buddhist anattā (at the aggregate level rather than Madhyamaka emptiness of emptiness) serves the article's comparative purpose and should not be expanded unless the article's scope changes.
