**Date**: 2026-02-24
**Article**: [[personal-identity|Personal Identity]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-06-personal-identity|2026-02-06]]
**Context**: Cross-review considering autonoetic consciousness insights

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The article remains stable through four consecutive reviews. No attribution errors, no internal contradictions, no missing required sections.

### Medium Issues Found

**Autonoetic paragraph missed constitutive view** (resolved): The paragraph mentioning autonoetic consciousness discussed reconstruction and the "pastness quale" but did not leverage the constitutive-contingent debate. The constitutive view—that autonoetic phenomenology *defines* episodic memory, not merely accompanies it—directly strengthens the haecceity argument: if the felt quality of re-experiencing is what makes memory episodic, then identity requires the experiencer, not just information. Added one sentence with cross-link.

**Bidirectional Connection missed autonoetic causal efficacy** (resolved): Klein's argument that autonoetic consciousness drives future self-projection (planning and counterfactual reasoning through specifically conscious experience) provides empirical support for the causal history argument. Added one sentence connecting autonoetic consciousness to bidirectional interaction.

### Low Issues Found

None new.

### Counterarguments Considered

The Churchland persona noted that the constitutive view of autonoesis is itself debated (De Brigard 2024 challenges it). The personal-identity article doesn't need to engage this debate in full—that's handled by the dedicated autonoetic-consciousness concept page. The cross-link allows readers to follow the argument.

## Attribution Accuracy Check

- [x] All claims attributed to sources are accurate
- [x] No dropped qualifiers
- [x] No overstated positions
- [x] Source/Map separation maintained
- [x] No self-contradictions
- [x] No false shared commitments

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

1. Excellent opening summary front-loading the key claim
2. Strong four-argument case for haecceity (conceivability, causal, explanatory gap, past-self)
3. Process haecceitism integration (from 2026-02-06 review)
4. Split-brain evidence with Nagel's observation
5. Comprehensive falsification conditions
6. Thorough tenet connections covering all five tenets
7. Past-self void and dreamless sleep void integrations
8. Unfalsifiability caveats on quantum mechanism (from 2026-02-17 pessimistic review)

### Enhancements Made

1. **Constitutive view integration**: Added to autonoetic paragraph—the felt quality of re-experiencing *defines* episodic memory, strengthening the connection between autonoetic consciousness and haecceity
2. **Autonoetic causal efficacy**: Added to Bidirectional Connection—Klein's argument that temporal self-projection drives planning through specifically conscious experience
3. **Prose tightening**: Trimmed Psychological View description, split-brain evidence, decoherence challenge, survival implications, and meaning connection to maintain length neutrality

### Cross-links Added

No new cross-links needed—[[autonoetic-consciousness]] already present in concepts frontmatter, inline text, and Further Reading from earlier versions.

## Changes Summary

This review integrated newly created autonoetic-consciousness.md insights in two targeted ways:

1. **Constitutive view**: The debate over whether autonoetic phenomenology defines episodic memory strengthens the irreducibility claim underlying haecceity
2. **Causal efficacy**: Klein's argument about temporal self-projection provides empirical grounding for the bidirectional interaction argument

Word count: 3154 → 3148 (-6, length-neutral). Five targeted trims offset the two additions.

## Remaining Items

None requiring immediate action.

## Stability Notes

This article remains highly stable. Four consecutive reviews (2026-01-30, 2026-02-03, 2026-02-06, 2026-02-24) have found no critical issues. Each review has made targeted integrations from newly created content rather than structural changes:
- 2026-01-30: past-self-void integration
- 2026-02-03: dreamless-sleep-void integration
- 2026-02-06: eastern-philosophy-consciousness (process haecceitism) integration
- 2026-02-24: autonoetic-consciousness (constitutive view, causal efficacy) integration

Future reviews should NOT:
- Re-flag the constitutive view integration—it correctly notes the debate without over-committing
- Re-flag the autonoetic causal efficacy addition—it's a targeted, well-supported point
- Re-flag process haecceitism, dreamless sleep, or past-self void integrations (all stable)
- Re-litigate philosophical disagreements (MWI, illusionism, Buddhist anattā)
- Expand significantly—article is at ~105% of word count target
- Re-flag the unfalsifiability caveats (stable since 2026-02-17)

The article has reached deep convergence. Unless major new content is created that directly bears on personal identity, further reviews are unlikely to find material improvements. The next review should be prompted by new content creation, not scheduled rotation.
