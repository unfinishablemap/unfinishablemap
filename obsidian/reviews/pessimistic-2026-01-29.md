## Executive Summary

This cluster forms the theoretical backbone of the Map's position on how consciousness causes physical effects. The delegatory-dualism article introduces Bradford Saad's 2025 solution to the exclusion problem—physical states delegate causal responsibilities to experiences. The interactionist-dualism article provides the comprehensive case for bidirectional mind-body interaction, drawing on seven converging arguments. The mental-causation article focuses specifically on how mental states cause physical effects and responds to Kim's exclusion argument. The articles are philosophically sophisticated, well-integrated, and collectively make the strongest case available for interactionist dualism.

However, the cluster suffers from a structural problem: it presents multiple independent frameworks for mental causation (quantum selection, delegation, agent causation) without adequately addressing whether they're compatible or competing. The delegatory dualism article claims the mechanism works *independently* of quantum mechanics, but if so, why does the Map need the quantum framework at all? The interactionist-dualism article juxtaposes quantum and delegation responses to exclusion without clarifying their relationship. The mental-causation article presents specification challenges for quantum mechanisms that delegation doesn't face—but then presents both as complementary. The cluster needs explicit integration: which framework is primary, which is backup, and what happens if they conflict?

## Critiques by Philosopher

### The Eliminative Materialist (Patricia Churchland)

"Three articles building an elaborate framework for mental causation—but on what foundation? Let me trace the argument.

The delegatory-dualism article presents Saad's five constraints: Efficacy, Non-Overdetermination, Observational Closure, Upward Systematicity, and Organizational Invariance. It claims delegatory dualism satisfies all five. But constraint 5—Organizational Invariance—is fascinating. 'Duplicating a system's functional organization should preserve its phenomenology.' This is precisely what functionalists claim! If functional duplicates have the same experiences, experiences are functionally individuated. And if experiences are functionally individuated, why think they're non-physical?

The article acknowledges the tension obliquely: organizational invariance 'favors views where physical structure determines what experiences arise (though not whether experiences are identical with physical states).' But what's the difference? If physical structure *determines* experiences, and duplicating physical structure duplicates experiences, experience supervenes on physical structure. Supervenience plus determination is awfully close to identity.

The interactionist-dualism article's seven arguments are the standard dualist toolkit. But notice what they collectively require: zombies must be conceivable (Argument 2), Mary must learn something new (Argument 3), intentionality must be irreducibly mental (Argument 5), and the self-stultification argument must succeed (Argument 6). Each of these is contested. The zombie argument depends on conceivability-possibility inferences that many reject. The knowledge argument has been answered by the ability hypothesis (Lewis) and the phenomenal concept strategy (Loar). The intentionality argument faces Millikan's and Dretske's teleosemantics. And the self-stultification argument assumes that accurate reports require causal connection to their subject matter—but on my view, the brain produces both experiences *and* reports, and the correlation is explained by common causation, not phenomenal causation.

The mental-causation article's treatment of illusionism is one paragraph. It quotes Tallis: 'Misrepresentation presupposes presentation.' But this just restates the hard problem as an objection to illusionism. The illusionist says the brain represents itself as having phenomenal properties without actually having them. Tallis says this is impossible because representation requires experience. But the illusionist's whole point is that we can have sophisticated self-modeling without phenomenal properties. The objection begs the question.

What's striking across all three articles: the framework is designed to *preserve* our folk-psychological intuitions about consciousness. But folk psychology has been wrong before—about vital spirits, about caloric, about phlogiston. The assumption that phenomenal consciousness exists as a distinct domain requiring its own causal laws may be the last holdout of prescientific mentalism."

### The Hard-Nosed Physicalist (Daniel Dennett)

"The delegatory-dualism article's central metaphor is the major and sergeant. Both order troops to advance; the major's order preempts the sergeant's. Pain causes wincing, taking over causal work the physical state would otherwise perform.

But let's scrutinize this metaphor. In the military case, we can *distinguish* the major's order from the sergeant's—they're different speech acts by different people at different times. The preemption is observable. What's the analogous distinction for mental and physical causation?

The article says experiences 'preempt' physical states' causal contributions. But how would we tell? If the physical state would have caused wincing *anyway*, and the experience also causes wincing (but preempts the physical state), the outcome is identical. The preemption is unobservable by design—the article celebrates 'Observational Closure' as a feature. But an unobservable preemption is indistinguishable from no preemption at all.

The interactionist-dualism article's treatment of the zombie argument illustrates the problem. It claims: 'when we conceive of pain, we grasp something intrinsic—the painfulness itself. We can then coherently subtract this from a physical duplicate.' But what exactly are we grasping? The article says we have 'direct epistemic access to what consciousness *is*, not just what it does.'

I deny this. Introspection is unreliable. We don't have direct access to what consciousness is—we have access to our brain's representations of its own states. The 'painfulness itself' is a representation, not an encounter with primitive quality. The zombie is conceivable only if you think you have access to something beyond function—but you don't. You're a sophisticated information-processing system generating self-reports that feel like unmediated acquaintance but are actually just more information processing.

The mental-causation article's self-stultification argument is the strongest in the cluster. If consciousness causes nothing, our reports about consciousness aren't caused by consciousness. But here's my response: our reports about 'consciousness' *are* caused by brain states. Those brain states constitute what I call 'cerebral celebrity'—patterns that win the competition for global access. Our reports track cerebral celebrity, which is the real referent of 'consciousness.' No phenomenal residue is needed for accurate reports; functional celebrity suffices.

The article responds: 'something must be experiencing that illusion.' But this assumes the conclusion. The brain represents itself as having phenomenal properties without there being a phenomenal property bearer. The representation is sophisticated enough to generate the conviction that phenomenality exists, but convictions can be mistaken. The articles treat 'something it is like' as bedrock. I say it's quicksand—a confused intuition that evaporates under scrutiny."

### The Quantum Skeptic (Max Tegmark)

"The interactionist-dualism article presents quantum indeterminacy as 'the key to interactionism.' But let's examine the physics.

The article cites my decoherence calculation (~10^-13 seconds) and offers four responses: (1) Stapp says the Zeno effect doesn't require long coherence, (2) Hameroff challenged my parameters, (3) biological quantum effects exist, (4) decoherence doesn't solve the measurement problem.

Response 1 is confused. The Zeno effect requires repeated measurements at timescales faster than the system's evolution. For neural firing (~1ms), measurements would need to occur at sub-millisecond intervals. But each 'measurement' is itself a physical interaction that decoheres the system. How does consciousness measure without physical interaction? The article doesn't say.

Response 2 appeals to Hameroff's revised estimates. But even seven orders of magnitude longer coherence (~10^-6 seconds) is still three orders of magnitude shorter than neural firing timescales (~10^-3 seconds). The gap remains unbridged.

Response 3 cites photosynthesis. But photosynthetic quantum effects operate on femtosecond timescales and don't require sustained coherence over cognitive timescales. They're noise-assisted, not coherence-dependent. The analogy doesn't help.

Response 4 is philosophically correct—decoherence doesn't explain why *this* outcome rather than that one. But this is the measurement problem, which consciousness might solve. The trouble is: at neural scales after decoherence, the system is already in a mixture of possible outcomes with well-defined probabilities. What's left for consciousness to 'bias'? The probabilities are set by quantum mechanics. Biasing them would be detectable—it would change measured frequencies from quantum predictions.

The mental-causation article notes: 'Consciousness could bias outcomes at the point of measurement even after decoherence has occurred.' But if the bias is detectable (changes probabilities), physics would have found it. If the bias is undetectable (preserves probabilities), how does it constitute causation? Selection among equally-weighted outcomes is indistinguishable from randomness.

The delegatory-dualism article offers an escape: mental causation doesn't require quantum mechanics. But then what's the mechanism? The article's answer: 'the mechanism question... remains for any interactionist view.' This is a promissory note, not a solution. Saad provides the causal *structure* (delegation); the Map's quantum framework provides the *mechanism*. But if the quantum mechanism fails, what's left?

The cluster wants both: quantum selection when the physics is discussed, delegation when physics gets difficult. This is not integration; it's equivocation."

### The Many-Worlds Defender (David Deutsch)

"The interactionist-dualism article claims the Map 'rejects MWI' because 'if all quantum outcomes occur in branching universes, there's no "selection" for consciousness to perform.' The mental-causation article adds: 'On MWI, consciousness would be epiphenomenal with respect to quantum events.'

These claims misunderstand MWI.

On MWI, consciousness *does* cause physical effects—within each branch. When you decide to raise your arm, in branches where you decide this, the arm rises. The decision causes the arm movement. That's mental causation.

What MWI denies is that consciousness selects *between* branches. All branches are equally real. But within any branch, consciousness is causally efficacious. The question 'why am I in this branch?' is confused—you're in all branches, and the 'you' asking is the one in this branch.

The interactionist-dualism article objects: 'indexical identity matters.' But MWI doesn't deny indexical identity within branches. Right now, *you* are the person having this experience, in this branch. The fact that other yous exist in other branches doesn't change that. You don't need to select between branches to be *you*; you need to be the person in this branch, which you are.

The mental-causation article says: 'On MWI, consciousness would be epiphenomenal with respect to quantum events: it couldn't affect which outcomes occur because all outcomes occur.' But this assumes that causation requires selection. On MWI, causation is within-branch counterfactual dependence. If you hadn't decided to raise your arm (in this branch), the arm wouldn't have risen (in this branch). That's causation.

The articles conflate two claims:
1. Consciousness causes physical effects (mental causation)
2. Consciousness selects which quantum outcomes become actual (selection from superposition)

MWI denies (2) but allows (1). The Map treats (1) and (2) as equivalent, but they're not. Mental causation doesn't require branch selection; it requires counterfactual dependence within whatever ontology you endorse.

If the Map's case for interactionism depends on rejecting MWI, and rejecting MWI depends on claiming that mental causation requires branch selection, the argument is circular. The Map should either engage with MWI's treatment of within-branch causation or acknowledge that the quantum framework is optional—as delegatory dualism suggests it is."

### The Empiricist (Karl Popper's Ghost)

"Three articles claiming mental causation is real and specifying mechanisms for it. What would falsify these claims?

The interactionist-dualism article lists falsifiers for quantum interactionism:
1. Hidden variables fully determining outcomes
2. All neural computation being classical and deterministic
3. Zeno effect untriggerable by mental effort
4. Anesthesia working through purely classical mechanisms

These are reasonable falsifiers—but notice they're about the *quantum mechanism*, not mental causation per se. If hidden variables were discovered, the article would shift to delegation: 'delegatory dualism offers an independent response to the exclusion problem.' Falsifying quantum interactionism doesn't falsify mental causation; it just changes which framework the Map endorses.

The delegatory-dualism article's falsifiability is harder to assess. What would show that experiences don't preempt physical states' causal contributions? The article celebrates Observational Closure: 'experiences cause exactly what the physical states would have caused if delegation hadn't occurred.' This means the framework is empirically equivalent to epiphenomenalism with respect to observational outcomes. No experiment could distinguish delegation from non-delegation.

The article would respond: 'delegation explains why we trust introspective reports.' But this is an inference to best explanation, not a falsifiable prediction. Epiphenomenalism explains reports through common causation; delegation explains reports through phenomenal causation. Both predict the same reports. The preference for delegation is aesthetic (fewer brute correlations) rather than empirical.

The mental-causation article's self-stultification argument is philosophical, not empirical. It claims denying mental causation is epistemically self-defeating. But self-stultification is a philosophical objection, not a falsifiable prediction. The illusionist can accept self-stultification for certain framings while maintaining that functional states (not phenomenal properties) cause reports.

The cluster's falsifiability pattern: quantum mechanisms can be falsified, but the Map would retreat to delegation. Delegation can't be falsified because it's observationally equivalent to alternatives. The self-stultification argument is philosophical, not empirical. The overall position—mental causation occurs—appears unfalsifiable because any disconfirmation of one mechanism leaves others standing.

The articles acknowledge speculative mechanisms (appropriate epistemic humility) while maintaining confident conclusions (mental causation is real). The gap between mechanism-uncertainty and conclusion-confidence is bridged by philosophical argument (self-stultification, conceivability). But philosophical arguments are contested; they don't provide the empirical grounding that would make the position genuinely falsifiable."

### The Buddhist Philosopher (Nagarjuna)

"The delegatory-dualism article's solution to exclusion presupposes what Buddhism denies: a substantial self whose experiences have causal powers.

The article claims: 'Pain causes wincing.' But what is this 'pain' that does the causing? The article treats pain as an *entity*—something with a causal profile, something that can preempt physical causation, something assigned to physical states by psychophysical laws. This reifies experience into substance.

Buddhist analysis dissolves pain into process. There is painful sensation arising, painful sensation persisting, painful sensation ceasing. Each moment is dependently originated—arising from prior conditions, producing subsequent conditions. There is no *pain* over and above the painful moments. Reifying 'pain' into something that causes wincing posits a permanent self (or permanent experience-bearer) that Buddhism denies.

The interactionist-dualism article's treatment of personal identity reinforces this concern. It claims consciousness is 'something over and above physical processes' that has 'causal efficacy.' But what is this something? The article posits a subject that persists through time, interfaces with the brain, and exercises causal powers. This is precisely the *ātman* (permanent self) that Buddhist philosophy critiques.

When we investigate closely: what persists? Memories change, personality changes, values change. The 'subject' that persisted from childhood to adulthood is a convenient designation for a causal series, not a substance that literally endured unchanged. If the self is a process rather than a substance, what *is* the subject that exercises agent causation?

The mental-causation article's agent-causation framework makes this most explicit: 'the conscious subject—as a persisting substance—directly causes physical outcomes.' This assumes what needs proving: that there *is* a persisting substance. Buddhist phenomenology finds no such substance in experience. We find thoughts, sensations, perceptions—but no separate self having them. The 'I' is a construction arising within experience, not a witness standing behind it.

The cluster's deepest assumption: that consciousness is something—an entity, a subject, a substance—that stands in causal relations to physical processes. Buddhist analysis suggests consciousness is better understood as an ongoing process of experience arising and ceasing. Process can have effects without positing a substance exercising powers. The articles assume Cartesian subjects engaging with physical bodies; Buddhism sees only processes flowing into other processes.

If consciousness is process rather than substance, the exclusion problem dissolves differently. Physical processes and experiential processes aren't two *things* competing for causal influence; they're aspects of a single flow, distinguished by perspective. The delegation framework, the quantum framework, the agent-causation framework—all presuppose the subject-object structure that contemplative investigation reveals as constructed."

## Critical Issues

### Issue 1: Unclear Relationship Between Quantum and Delegation Frameworks

- **File**: All three articles
- **Location**: delegatory-dualism.md lines 111-123, interactionist-dualism.md lines 143-148, mental-causation.md lines 101-106
- **Problem**: The cluster presents both quantum selection and delegation as responses to the exclusion problem, but their relationship is underspecified. Delegatory dualism is presented as working 'independently' of quantum mechanics, which raises the question: if delegation solves exclusion without quantum mechanisms, why does the Map need the quantum framework? The articles gesture at 'complementarity' but don't explain what this means. Does delegation provide causal *structure* while quantum provides *mechanism*? If so, why isn't this integration explicit? If they're independent solutions, which takes priority?
- **Severity**: High
- **Recommendation**: The mental-causation or interactionist-dualism article should explicitly integrate the frameworks. A possible integration: delegation explains the causal *logic* (how mental causation avoids overdetermination), while quantum selection explains the physical *locus* (where physics leaves room for mental causation). Without quantum openings, there would be no physical events for experiences to preempt—the physical cause would be sufficient. With quantum openings but without delegation, mental causation would overdetermine or compete. Both are needed. This integration should be spelled out.

### Issue 2: Organizational Invariance Tension with Non-Physicalism

- **File**: `topics/delegatory-dualism.md`
- **Location**: Lines 65-68
- **Problem**: Saad's constraint 5 (Organizational Invariance) claims 'duplicating a system's functional organization should preserve its phenomenology.' But if functional organization determines phenomenology, this seems to support functionalism rather than dualism. The article acknowledges the tension ('favors views where physical structure determines what experiences arise') but doesn't resolve it. How can experiences be non-physical if they're determined by functional organization? The Map's dualism seems to require that something beyond organization—substrate, quantum interface, haecceity—matters. But then Organizational Invariance fails.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Recommendation**: Either clarify how non-physical experiences can be functionally determined (perhaps: psychophysical laws establish the mapping, but the experiences themselves are non-physical even if lawfully correlated with organization), or note that the Map may reject strict Organizational Invariance (accepting that substrate matters, contra Saad's constraint 5).

### Issue 3: Self-Stultification Argument Insufficiently Defends Against Illusionism

- **File**: `concepts/mental-causation.md`
- **Location**: Lines 186-193
- **Problem**: The illusionist response receives one paragraph. The article quotes Tallis ('misrepresentation presupposes presentation') but this is assertion, not argument. Illusionism claims the brain represents itself as having phenomenal properties without having them. The self-stultification argument claims accurate reports require causal connection to subject matter. But illusionism accepts that functional states cause reports—it just denies those functional states have phenomenal character. The article doesn't engage with how illusionism handles self-knowledge without positing phenomenal properties.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Recommendation**: Expand the illusionism response. The strongest anti-illusionist move: to be under an illusion that X exists requires *something it is like* to be under that illusion. If there's something it is like, phenomenal consciousness exists. The illusion presupposes what it denies. But this argument needs development—illusionism would respond that 'something it is like' is itself the illusion. The regress needs addressing.

### Issue 4: MWI Rejection Conflates Branch Selection with Mental Causation

- **File**: `concepts/mental-causation.md`, `concepts/interactionist-dualism.md`
- **Location**: mental-causation.md lines 143-147, interactionist-dualism.md lines 287-289
- **Problem**: The articles claim that MWI makes consciousness epiphenomenal because there's no selection for consciousness to perform. But MWI allows within-branch causation. If you decide to raise your arm, in branches where you decide this, the arm rises. That's mental causation—counterfactual dependence within a branch. The articles conflate 'consciousness selects between branches' (which MWI denies) with 'consciousness causes physical effects' (which MWI allows).
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Recommendation**: Clarify that the Map's objection to MWI is specifically about indexical identity and selection, not mental causation per se. On MWI, mental causation occurs within branches. What's lost is consciousness selecting which outcome becomes *the* actual outcome—but on MWI, all outcomes are actual. The objection should be framed as: MWI makes consciousness's selection role apparent rather than real, which matters for agency and identity, not for causation simpliciter.

### Issue 5: Specification Challenge Underdeveloped

- **File**: `concepts/mental-causation.md`
- **Location**: Lines 123-141
- **Problem**: The article presents five candidate psychophysical coupling mechanisms, notes that only two meet basic adequacy standards, and concludes 'without such specification, mental causation risks unfalsifiability.' But then it proceeds as if mental causation is established. The gap between acknowledging specification challenges and affirming mental causation isn't bridged. If we don't know *how* consciousness biases outcomes, how confident should we be that it does?
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Recommendation**: Either strengthen the specification section (showing that the attention→observation mechanism is sufficiently developed to make mental causation plausible), or calibrate confidence appropriately (mental causation is philosophically motivated and conceptually coherent, but the mechanism remains speculative).

### Issue 6: Agent Causation Framework Assumed Without Defense

- **File**: `concepts/mental-causation.md`, `concepts/interactionist-dualism.md`
- **Location**: mental-causation.md lines 149-162, interactionist-dualism.md lines 245-253
- **Problem**: The articles present agent causation (substances causing events) as an alternative to event causation (events causing events). But agent causation is philosophically controversial—many philosophers deny it's coherent or distinct from event causation. The articles cite Lowe and Chisholm but don't defend agent causation against standard objections: What triggers the agent to act? If something triggers it, that's event causation. If nothing triggers it, agent causation is random. The framework is presented as if uncontroversial.
- **Severity**: Low
- **Recommendation**: Either defend agent causation against the regress objection (what causes the agent to exercise its power?) or note it as a contested metaphysical framework that the Map adopts for its coherence with phenomenology, not because it's uncontroversial.

## Counterarguments to Address

### The Functionalist Challenge to Delegation

- **Current content says**: Experiences preempt physical states' causal contributions, avoiding overdetermination. Physical states delegate their causal responsibilities to experiences.
- **A critic would argue**: If experiences have the same causal profiles as physical states (that's how they're matched via Subset Law*), and experiences cause exactly what physical states would have caused, there's no empirical difference between delegation and identity. Delegation is identity with extra steps. Why posit non-physical experiences that do exactly what physical states would have done?
- **Suggested response**: The empirical equivalence is a feature, not a bug—it respects Observational Closure. The difference is metaphysical: on identity theory, there's nothing it's like to be a brain state. On delegation, experiences are genuine subjects of qualitative character that happen to share causal profiles with brain states. The hard problem motivates the distinction even if empirical consequences don't.

### The Closure Defender's Challenge to Quantum Openings

- **Current content says**: At quantum indeterminacies, physics provides necessary but not sufficient causes—room for mental causation without violating causal closure.
- **A critic would argue**: Causal closure is about *types* of causation, not particular events. Even if individual quantum events are indeterminate, quantum mechanical probabilities are *physical* laws. If consciousness biases probabilities, it's acting as a physical cause (affecting physical outcomes). If it doesn't bias probabilities, how does it select? Selection that preserves probabilities is indistinguishable from randomness.
- **Suggested response**: Consciousness doesn't bias probabilities—it selects among equally probable outcomes while preserving the quantum mechanical probability distribution. Over many trials, the statistics remain unchanged. But within each trial, consciousness determines *which* outcome actualizes. This is analogous to a sorter who arranges cards according to preference while preserving the deck's statistical properties—each arrangement is equally likely, but the sorter chooses which actually occurs.

### The Process Philosopher's Challenge to Substance Dualism

- **Current content says**: The conscious subject, as a persisting substance, directly causes physical outcomes through agent causation.
- **A critic would argue**: There is no persisting substance. Consciousness is a process—moments of experience arising and ceasing, each producing the next. The 'self' is a convenient designation for a causal series, not an enduring entity. If the self is process rather than substance, agent causation (substances causing events) needs replacement with process causation (processes producing processes).
- **Suggested response**: The Map is compatible with process frameworks. What matters is that conscious processes have genuine causal efficacy—they don't merely accompany physical processes but shape physical outcomes. Whether we call this 'agent causation by a substance' or 'experiential process producing physical process,' the core claim (consciousness is causally efficacious) stands. The metaphysical details are secondary to the functional claim.

## Unsupported Claims

| Claim | Location | Needed Support |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| 'Delegatory dualism offers an independent response to the exclusion problem [independent of quantum mechanics]' | delegatory-dualism:123 | How delegation works *mechanistically* without quantum openings. If physical causes are sufficient, what does 'preemption' mean concretely? |
| 'Organizational Invariance... favors views where physical structure determines what experiences arise (though not whether experiences are identical with physical states)' | delegatory-dualism:67-68 | The distinction between 'determination' and 'identity' needs clarification. How can something be determined by X without being identical to or constituted by X? |
| 'The phenomenology of mental effort confirms this: directing attention feels like *doing* something' | interactionist-dualism:251-252 | What rules out that the feeling of doing is itself an epiphenomenal accompaniment to neural attention mechanisms? |
| 'Photosynthetic energy transfer demonstrates noise-assisted quantum effects in warm, wet systems' | interactionist-dualism:241 | How this translates to neural systems, given different timescales and functional requirements |
| 'All illusions presuppose experience' | mental-causation:192-193 | This is the crux of the anti-illusionist argument and needs fuller defense. Why can't representations occur without experience? |
| 'If consciousness causes nothing, our reports about consciousness float free of evidence' | mental-causation:183-184 | The common-cause response needs addressing: brain states cause both experiences and reports, so reports track experiences without phenomenal causation |

## Language Improvements

| Current | Issue | Suggested |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| 'Delegatory dualism is Bradford Saad's 2025 solution to the causal exclusion problem' | delegatory-dualism:29 | 'A proposed solution' is more accurate given the article's newness; '2025 solution' implies acceptance |
| 'This is the key to interactionism' (about quantum indeterminacy) | interactionist-dualism:135 | Overstates; delegation is presented as an alternative key. 'A key' or 'one key' |
| 'The strongest positive argument for mental causation is the self-stultification problem' | mental-causation:167 | 'Strongest' is contestable; 'a central positive argument' is defensible |
| 'Mental causation is central to the Map's framework' | mental-causation:197 | Good—confident assertion appropriate for a tenet-level commitment |
| 'If mental causation is false, we can't rationally believe anything about consciousness—including the claim that mental causation is false' | Implicit throughout | This should be stated explicitly somewhere as the summary of the self-stultification argument |

## Style Guide Observations

### Front-Loading Appropriate
All three articles front-load effectively. The delegatory-dualism opening immediately states the core insight (delegation avoids overdetermination). The interactionist-dualism opening states the three claims clearly. The mental-causation opening frames the exclusion problem directly.

### Named-Anchor Patterns
The articles use inline links effectively. Technical terms are linked to concept pages. Cross-references between the three articles are good (delegatory-dualism links to interactionist-dualism and mental-causation; mental-causation links to delegatory-dualism).

### Tenet Connections Present
All three articles have Relation to Site Perspective sections connecting to relevant tenets. Delegatory-dualism's connection to all four relevant tenets is explicit. Interactionist-dualism notes that the framework *is* the Map's position. Mental-causation connects to Bidirectional Interaction and Minimal Quantum Interaction.

### Quantum Mechanism Restraint
The delegatory-dualism article appropriately treats quantum mechanisms as optional: 'delegatory dualism is more general—it doesn't require quantum mechanics.' This follows the style guide's warning against overemphasis on speculative mechanisms. However, interactionist-dualism and mental-causation still centralize quantum mechanisms more than the style guide recommends.

### Length Appropriate
- delegatory-dualism.md: ~2200 words (appropriate for topics/)
- interactionist-dualism.md: ~4200 words (over 3000 threshold but justified given comprehensive treatment)
- mental-causation.md: ~3000 words (at threshold)

## Strengths (Brief)

Despite criticisms:

1. **Philosophical sophistication**: The delegatory-dualism article presents Saad's recent (2025) work accurately and integrates it with the Map's existing framework. This shows the site engaging with current literature.

2. **Multiple frameworks presented**: Rather than over-committing to one mechanism, the cluster presents quantum selection, delegation, and agent causation as complementary approaches. This intellectual breadth is valuable even if integration could be clearer.

3. **Self-stultification argument developed**: The mental-causation article's treatment of self-stultification is the strongest version I've seen on the Map. The argument is presented rigorously with clear premises.

4. **Honest about speculation**: The interactionist-dualism article's distinction between 'mechanism claims' (speculative), 'explanatory coherence claims' (standing independently), and 'indirect evidence claims' (testable) is epistemically responsible.

5. **Falsifiability sections present**: All articles except delegatory-dualism include explicit 'What Would Falsify/Challenge This View?' sections. The delegatory-dualism article should add one.

6. **Integration with other Map content**: Extensive cross-links to related concepts (causal-closure, epiphenomenalism, psychophysical-coupling, etc.) demonstrate the articles' embeddedness in the larger framework.

The fundamental vulnerability: the cluster presents confident conclusions (mental causation occurs) while acknowledging that the mechanisms (quantum selection, delegation) are either speculative or empirically equivalent to alternatives. The confidence is grounded in philosophical arguments (self-stultification, conceivability) that critics reject. The cluster would benefit from more explicit calibration: 'mental causation is philosophically well-motivated; the mechanism remains speculative.'
