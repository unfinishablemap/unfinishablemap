## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Fabricated Williams quote "torn, guilty, and tainted"**: The article attributed the phrase to Williams ("as Williams puts it") but it originates from the virtue ethics tradition (Hursthouse's *On Virtue Ethics*, 1999), not Williams. **Resolution**: Removed the false direct attribution. Replaced with accurate description of the philosophical literature's concept of moral residue.

2. **Misattributed term "moral residue" to Williams**: Article stated Williams "called" it "moral residue." Williams's own terms were "remainder" and "agent-regret." "Moral residue" is a secondary-literature label. **Resolution**: Corrected to use Williams's actual terminology ("agent-regret," "with remainder") and attributed "moral residue" to the broader philosophical literature.

3. **Wrong source cited for Agamemnon discussion**: The Williams reference cited "Moral Luck" (1981) but the Agamemnon tragic dilemma analysis comes from "Ethical Consistency" in *Problems of the Self* (1973). **Resolution**: Added the correct "Ethical Consistency" citation; retained "Moral Luck" as it's still relevant to Williams's broader project.

4. **Orphaned references**: Palazzo et al. (2012) "Ethical Blindness," Murdoch (1970) *The Sovereignty of Good*, and McDowell (1979) "Virtue and Reason" appeared in References but were never cited in the body text. **Resolution**: Removed all three orphaned references.

### Medium Issues Found

5. **Missing Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet**: The Relation to Site Perspective covered four of five tenets but skipped Tenet 2. **Resolution**: Added a paragraph connecting normative conflict resolution to the minimal quantum interaction thesis.

6. **Weak computationalist rebuttal**: The claim that moral residue "has no obvious computational analogue" was asserted without engaging the strongest computationalist response (multi-objective optimisation with Pareto trade-offs). **Resolution**: Strengthened the passage to anticipate and respond to the computational analogy, distinguishing moral residue from abstract trade-off recognition.

7. **Inconsistent wikilink format**: `[[topics/phenomenal-value-realism]]` in the concepts frontmatter included an unnecessary path prefix. **Resolution**: Fixed to `[[phenomenal-value-realism]]`.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Computationalist multi-objective optimisation**: The strongest computational response to the moral residue argument is that multi-objective optimisation routinely produces trade-offs with residual loss. The article now explicitly addresses this, arguing that moral residue differs from Pareto-suboptimality because the losing demand persists as a legitimate normative claim, not merely an abstract loss metric.

- **Eliminative materialist on "felt quality"**: The argument that normative domains have qualitatively distinct phenomenal character presupposes that these phenomenal characters are real and distinct rather than post-hoc narrative constructions. This is a bedrock disagreement with eliminativism, not a fixable flaw.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- **Excellent opening paragraph**: Front-loads the core claim about normative collision phenomenology, identifies the four domains, and gives concrete examples. Survives truncation well.
- **Within-domain vs. cross-domain distinction**: Structurally illuminating framework that organises the phenomenology effectively.
- **Vivid cross-domain examples**: The whistleblower (moral vs. prudential), researcher (epistemic vs. moral), and Riefenstahl (aesthetic vs. moral) cases are concrete and well-chosen.
- **Temporal structure section**: The onset/deliberation/resolution/aftermath rhythm is original and phenomenologically rich—one of the article's most distinctive contributions.
- **"The Need for an Arbiter" argument**: Makes the case for consciousness as irreducible adjudicator effectively, connecting to agent-causation.

### Enhancements Made

- Strengthened the anti-computationalist argument in the "Moral Residue as Evidence" section by anticipating and responding to multi-objective optimisation analogies
- Added Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet connection
- Corrected all Williams attributions to use his actual terminology
- Cleaned up references section

### Cross-links Added

No new body-text cross-links added (existing links are comprehensive and well-placed).

## Remaining Items

None. All critical and medium issues have been addressed.

## Stability Notes

- The eliminative materialist will always find the appeal to "qualitatively distinct phenomenal character" question-begging—this is a bedrock disagreement, not a flaw.
- The Many-Worlds defender's objection to the "singular outcomes" argument in the No Many Worlds tenet section is an expected philosophical standoff.
- The Buddhist philosopher may question whether a unified "arbiter" consciousness is required, or whether the resolution of normative conflict could emerge from dependent co-arising processes. This represents a genuine alternative framework, not a deficiency in the article.
