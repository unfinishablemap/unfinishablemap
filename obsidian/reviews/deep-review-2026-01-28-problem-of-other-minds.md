**Date**: 2026-01-28
**Article**: [[problem-of-other-minds|Problem of Other Minds]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-22-problem-of-other-minds|2026-01-22]]
**Context**: Cross-review considering other-minds-void.md insights

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The previous review (2026-01-22) addressed the main gaps including illusionism engagement, falsifiability conditions, alternative frameworks (process philosophy, Buddhist), and tenet connections.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Missing cross-reference to other-minds-void**: The new voids article offers complementary insights—Husserl's paradox that inaccessibility is constitutive of otherness, unusual cases (Hogan twins) suggesting partial exploration, the three-void-type taxonomy.
   - **Resolution**: Added other-minds-void to related_articles and Further Reading with description.

2. **Husserl's constitutive framing absent**: The voids article's key insight—that the void *constitutes* intersubjectivity rather than merely blocking access—was philosophically important.
   - **Resolution**: Added new "Husserl's Constitutive Paradox" subsection (~150 words) under Major Solutions.

### Low Issues Found
- Mechanism gap in dualist causation (acknowledged limitation, not fixable)
- MWI counterargument about indexicality (bedrock disagreement, previously marked resolved)

### Counterarguments Considered
All six adversarial personas applied. No new critical issues found. Eliminative materialist and Dennett perspectives raise objections that are bedrock disagreements rather than flaws to fix.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- The "Argument from Discourse" section—genuinely novel contribution to the literature
- Opening paragraph's vivid, direct, philosophically precise framing
- The Dualist's Dilemma section's clear tenet connection
- Overall structure aiding navigation
- Treatment of animals/machines extension
- Illusionist engagement (added in previous review)
- Process philosophy and Buddhist frameworks (added in previous review)
- Falsifiability conditions (added in previous review)

### Enhancements Made
1. Added "Husserl's Constitutive Paradox" subsection explaining that inaccessibility constitutes rather than merely blocks intersubjectivity
2. Added "Is the Asymmetry Absolute?" section discussing Hogan twins case and BCI implications
3. Added cross-link to [[other-minds-void]] in related_articles and Further Reading
4. Integrated the voids framework perspective throughout

### Cross-links Added
- [[other-minds-void]]

## Word Count Changes
- Before: 1812 words
- After: 2107 words
- Added: ~295 words
- Status: 84% of soft threshold (2500), well within limits

## Remaining Items

None. The cross-review successfully integrated insights from other-minds-void.md.

## Stability Notes

This article is approaching stability. The previous review (2026-01-22) added substantial content (~2300 words) addressing major gaps. This cross-review added targeted enhancements (~295 words) integrating insights from the newly created other-minds-void.md article. Future reviews should focus on:

- Verifying links remain accurate
- Checking for new site content to cross-reference
- NOT re-flagging: eliminativist objections (bedrock disagreement), MWI indexicality debates (bedrock disagreement), heterophenomenology engagement (addressed)

The article now provides both the epistemological analysis (this concepts article) and the structural/constitutive framing (via cross-link to other-minds-void), giving readers a complete picture.
