**Date**: 2026-02-24
**Article**: [[consciousness-and-testimony|Consciousness and Testimony]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-23-consciousness-and-testimony|2026-02-23]]

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Broken wikilinks to archived articles**: `[[consciousness-and-the-authority-of-logic]]` and `[[consciousness-and-semantic-understanding]]` were archived and superseded by `consciousness-and-the-authority-of-formal-systems` and `phenomenology-of-understanding` respectively. The coalescing operation on 2026-02-24 re-introduced these stale links. **Resolution**: Updated all references in both frontmatter and body text to point to replacement articles.
- **"This is not" LLM cliché** (style guide violation): "This is not a vicious circle" in the epistemic circle section. **Resolution**: Rephrased to "The circularity is productive rather than vicious."

### Medium Issues Found
- **Unsupported social cognition claims**: Specific claims about "amygdala-based threat evaluation" and "facial structure influence trust judgments" lacked citations. **Resolution**: Softened to general language about "rapid subpersonal evaluation" without making specific neuroscience claims that lack references.
- **Length at 115% of soft threshold**: Article was coalesced from 3 sources and slightly over target. **Resolution**: Trimmed redundant intersubjective void discussion from the tenets section (already covered in its dedicated section). Final count: 3,415 words (114% of soft threshold) — modest improvement, remaining overage acceptable given the article's scope.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminativist replacement strategy**: Previous review deferred deeper engagement. Article's current treatment remains adequate for scope. Not re-flagging.
- **Buddhist no-self challenge**: Previous review deferred as tangential. Not re-flagging.

## Attribution Accuracy Check

All attribution checks passed:
- Hume's reductionism about testimony: correctly attributed
- Reid's anti-reductionism: correctly attributed
- Schwitzgebel (2008) on introspective unreliability: correctly attributed with qualifiers preserved ("naive," "many domains")
- Jackson's knowledge argument: correctly attributed
- Dennett's heterophenomenology: correctly attributed to 2003 paper
- Churchland's eliminativism: correctly attributed
- No source/Map conflation detected
- No self-contradictions found
- No dropped qualifiers

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- The epistemic circle / self-grounding framing (central thesis)
- The thermometer analogy — makes the constitutive/observational distinction vivid
- "Propositionally correct but phenomenally hollow" — captures testimonial chain degradation precisely
- The eliminativist bind formulation — locates self-refutation in testimonial structure
- Transparency-to-opacity phenomenological description of suspicion arising
- The farmer vs. algorithm contrast — effective concrete example
- The constitutive vs. observational distinction in the tenet connection

### Enhancements Made
- Updated 4 wikilinks from archived articles to their current replacements
- Rephrased LLM cliché construct
- Softened unsupported empirical claims about social cognition
- Trimmed redundant intersubjective void discussion from tenets section

### Cross-links Updated
- [[consciousness-and-the-authority-of-formal-systems]] — replaced archived [[consciousness-and-the-authority-of-logic]]
- [[phenomenology-of-understanding]] — replaced archived [[consciousness-and-semantic-understanding]]

## Remaining Items

None — all critical and medium issues addressed. The article remains slightly above the soft word count threshold but the overage is modest and justified by the topic's scope (coalesced from 3 articles covering distinct aspects of testimony).

## Stability Notes

- The article has now been reviewed twice. The previous review's stability notes remain valid: adversarial personas' philosophical disagreements (Dennett on heterophenomenology, MWI on indexicality, eliminativist replacement strategy, Buddhist no-self) are expected standoffs, not fixable flaws. Future reviews should not re-flag these.
- The article's structure and arguments are stable. The main changes in this review were link maintenance (post-coalescing cleanup) and minor style fixes, not substantive content changes. This suggests the article is approaching maturity.
- The word count (3,415) sits above the soft threshold. Future reviews should prioritize tightening prose if the article is expanded, but should not cut substantive content to meet the target.
