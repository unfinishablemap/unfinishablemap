# Tenet Alignment Check

**Date**: 2026-01-21
**Files checked**: 133 (18 topics + 115 concepts)
**Errors**: 0
**Warnings**: 0
**Notes**: 0

## Summary

All content files demonstrate strong alignment with the five foundational tenets. Both topics (18 files) and concepts (115 files) consistently support the Map's dualist framework. Articles discussing opposing views (illusionism, eliminative materialism, many-worlds interpretation, functionalism, epiphenomenalism) present these positions for completeness but consistently critique them rather than endorse them. The vast majority of substantive articles include explicit "Relation to Site Perspective" or "Relation to Site Tenets" sections that connect content to the relevant tenets.

## Tenet-by-Tenet Summary

### Tenet 1: Dualism

All files support dualism. Materialism and illusionism are discussed as opposing views but consistently critiqued. No file endorses eliminative materialism or treats consciousness as purely illusory.

**Key examples:**
- `hard-problem-of-consciousness.md` explicitly argues that consciousness is not reducible to physical processes
- `knowledge-argument.md` provides Mary's Room as powerful argument for non-physical facts
- `inverted-qualia.md` shows functional organization doesn't determine qualia
- `epiphenomenalism.md` explicitly rejects epiphenomenalism with self-stultification argument

### Tenet 2: Minimal Quantum Interaction

Files discussing quantum mechanisms support minimal quantum interaction. No quantum mysticism or uncontrolled psychokinesis is endorsed.

**Key examples:**
- `quantum-consciousness.md` describes Zeno effect and Orch OR without mysticism
- `decoherence.md` addresses objection while maintaining room for consciousness
- `meditation-and-consciousness-modes.md` connects quantum Zeno to effortful attention
- `consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns.md` describes selection without energy injection

### Tenet 3: Bidirectional Interaction

Multiple files explicitly support consciousness having causal efficacy. No file treats consciousness as epiphenomenal without critique.

**Key examples:**
- `epiphenomenalism.md` explicitly rejects epiphenomenalism as self-stultifying
- `mental-causation.md` central article on downward causation
- `attention-as-interface.md` attention as mechanism for consciousness influencing brain
- `working-memory.md` manipulation requires conscious reactivation

### Tenet 4: No Many Worlds

Several files explicitly reject MWI and support indexical identity/haecceity.

**Key examples:**
- `many-worlds.md` explicitly presents problems with MWI
- `haecceity.md` supports indexical "thisness"
- `near-death-experiences.md` discusses phenomenology of uniqueness resisting MWI
- `inverted-qualia.md` connects to haecceity and No MWI

### Tenet 5: Occam's Razor Has Limits

Several files directly address parsimony arguments.

**Key examples:**
- `knowledge-argument.md` notes physicalism's apparent simplicity fails before learning intuition
- `inverted-qualia.md` "simpler" theory ignores what needs explanation
- `near-death-experiences.md` warns against premature parsimony dismissing NDEs

## Files Passing All Checks

All 133 files (18 topics + 115 concepts) pass all tenet alignment checks:

**Topics (18):**
topics.md, hard-problem-of-consciousness.md, epistemic-advantages-of-dualism.md, death-and-consciousness.md, ethics-of-consciousness.md, time-collapse-and-agency.md, personal-identity.md, eastern-philosophy-consciousness.md, loss-of-consciousness.md, purpose-and-alignment.md, meaning-of-life.md, split-brain-consciousness.md, consciousness-in-simple-organisms.md, quantum-binding-and-phenomenal-unity.md, animal-consciousness.md, ai-consciousness.md, free-will.md, lucid-dreaming-and-consciousness.md

**Concepts (115):**
All concept files pass. Categories include: core dualist concepts, opposing views (discussed but critiqued), quantum consciousness, consciousness and experience, mind-brain interaction, free will and agency, alternative frameworks, and memory/cognition.

## Conclusion

The complete content collection (133 files) is well-aligned with all five tenets. The consistent use of "Relation to Site Perspective" sections ensures explicit tenet connections throughout the site. Opposing philosophical positions are presented for completeness and intellectual honesty but are consistently critiqued rather than endorsed. No remediation is required.

This check confirms the site maintains philosophical coherence across its entire content base.
