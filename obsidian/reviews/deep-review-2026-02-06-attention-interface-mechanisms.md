**Date**: 2026-02-06
**Article**: [[attention-interface-mechanisms|Mechanisms of the Attention-Consciousness Interface]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-05-attention-interface-mechanisms|2026-02-05]]
**Context**: Cross-review considering attention-motor-planning quantum interface article

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
1. **Wrong author attribution for theta oscillations paper**: The article cited "Bengson 2019" and listed authors as "Bengson, J.J., Mangun, G.R., & Mazaheri, A. (2019)." Verified via PubMed that the correct authors are Rajan, A., Siegel, S.N., Liu, Y., Bengson, J., Mangun, G.R., & Ding, M. (2019). Bengson is 4th author, not first; "Mazaheri" is not an author on this paper at all.
   - **Resolution**: Changed all in-text references from "Bengson 2019" to "Rajan et al. 2019" and corrected the reference entry.

2. **Wrong first author for dopamine study**: Reference 5 listed "Kaeser, P.A., et al. (2024)" but verified first author is Cai, X. (Kaeser is last/senior author). The companion article correctly uses "Cai et al. 2024."
   - **Resolution**: Corrected to "Cai, X., Liu, C., et al. (2024)" with added volume/page info.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Missing cross-link to companion topic article**: The new [[attention-motor-planning-quantum-interface]] article explicitly references this article for "candidate sites, timing constraints, and predictions" but this article didn't link back.
   - **Resolution**: Added to related_articles frontmatter and Further Reading section.

### Low Issues Noted
None new.

### Counterarguments Considered
All six adversarial personas engaged:
1. **Eliminative Materialist**: Three-layer architecture begs the question—consciousness as selector is a homunculus. Standing philosophical disagreement, not fixable.
2. **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: Heterophenomenological explanation of effort remains unaddressed. Standing disagreement from previous reviews.
3. **Quantum Skeptic**: Decoherence hedging remains appropriate. No new issues.
4. **Many-Worlds Defender**: MWI response adequate. Bedrock disagreement.
5. **Empiricist**: Falsification conditions remain clear and specific.
6. **Buddhist Philosopher**: Assumption of unitary agent doing selecting. Metaphysical disagreement with dualism itself.

### Attribution Accuracy Check
- Rizzolatti premotor theory ✓
- Wise & Murray 2022 prefrontal claim ✓
- **Rajan et al. 2019 theta oscillations ✗ → FIXED** (was incorrectly attributed to Bengson with wrong co-authors)
- Stapp ion channel hypothesis ✓
- Georgiev challenge ✓
- Penrose-Hameroff Orch OR ✓
- **Cai et al. 2024 dopamine study ✗ → FIXED** (was incorrectly listed under Kaeser as first author)
- Cisek parallel representation ✓
- Schurger 2012 stochastic reinterpretation ✓
- Sjöberg 2024 surgical evidence ✓
- Desmurget 2009 double dissociation ✓
- Meister 2024 bandwidth ✓
- Neumann et al. 2024 dopamine theta ✓

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Front-loaded opening with key insight (attention-motor substrate unity)
- Excellent tables (candidate sites, timing constraints, neural signatures)
- Honest engagement with challenges (Georgiev, decoherence, MWI)
- Specific falsification conditions
- The ~280ms/~300ms timing convergence observation
- "The Map doesn't commit to a specific mechanism" epistemic humility
- Selection vs Execution subsection's phenomenological acuity
- Framework-agnostic presentation of multiple candidate mechanisms

### Enhancements Made
1. Corrected two critical attribution errors (Rajan et al., Cai et al.)
2. Added cross-link to companion topic article [[attention-motor-planning-quantum-interface]]
3. Minor prose tightening to maintain length neutrality

### Cross-links Added
- [[attention-motor-planning-quantum-interface]] — in related_articles and Further Reading

## Length Analysis

- **Before**: 3991 words (133% of 3000 soft threshold)
- **After**: 3997 words (133% of 3000 soft threshold)
- **Change**: +6 words (length-neutral)

Operated in length-neutral mode: citation corrections and cross-link addition balanced by prose tightening.

## Remaining Items
None. The attribution errors were the significant finding this review. The article's philosophical content and structure remain stable.

## Stability Notes

From previous reviews (still applicable):
- The decoherence debate is a standing scientific controversy—do not re-flag unless new research changes the landscape
- MWI proponents will always find the indexical/selection argument unsatisfying—bedrock philosophical disagreement
- Quantum mechanism proposals appropriately presented as candidates without commitment
- The dopamine section integrates key insights from the comprehensive dopamine topic article—done in 2026-02-05 review

New for this review:
- The Rajan et al. 2019 citation is now correct and consistent with the companion article. Future reviews should not flag this.
- The Cai et al. 2024 citation is now correct. Future reviews should not flag this.
- Cross-link to [[attention-motor-planning-quantum-interface]] is established. Both articles now reference each other.
- The article has reached stability across 4 reviews (2026-02-02, 2026-02-02 orphan, 2026-02-05, 2026-02-06). Content improvements are marginal; future reviews should focus on attribution accuracy and cross-link maintenance rather than structural changes.
