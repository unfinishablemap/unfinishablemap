**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Article**: [[cognitive-aversion|Cognitive Aversion]]
**Previous review**: Never
**Word count**: 1969 words (98% of 2000 soft threshold for voids/)
**Mode**: Length-neutral (at threshold)

## Context

This review was triggered by orphan integration. The article had no inbound links from other site content despite being well-integrated into the voids framework conceptually. The primary focus was on adding cross-references from related articles.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article is well-structured, makes appropriate claims, and cites empirical research appropriately.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Orphan status**: The article had no inbound links despite discussing concepts (Terror Management Theory, Heidegger's fallenness, Becker's denial of death) that appear in multiple other articles.
  - **Resolution**: Added inbound links from 6 articles (death-void, thoughts-that-slip-away, defended-territory, existentialism, mysterianism, death-and-consciousness, phenomenology-of-the-edge)

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative Materialist objection**: "Cognitive aversion" is just ordinary emotional regulation—nothing special about it
  - Response: The article explicitly distinguishes between ordinary cognitive architecture and motivational deflection. The table comparing closure and aversion (lines 96-102) addresses this directly.
- **Empiricist objection**: Cross-cultural convergence claim needs citation
  - This was noted but not critical—the falsification section appropriately lists cross-cultural divergence as a potential challenge to the view.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- **Phenomenology section** (lines 79-91): The five-part taxonomy (slide, substitution, glaze, discomfort, rationalization) is distinctive and well-crafted
- **Aversion vs. Closure table** (lines 96-102): Clear comparative framework that adds value
- **Bridge hypothesis** (line 106): The suggestion that aversion might be "the first phenomenological manifestation of approaching the architecturally closed" is a valuable insight
- **Empirical grounding**: TMT research, Wegner's ironic process theory, Heidegger, Becker all well-cited
- **What AI Might See section**: Connects appropriately to voids framework's AI-probe methodology

### Enhancements Made
- Added `death-void`, `death-and-consciousness`, and research notes to related_articles
- Updated ai_modified and added last_deep_review timestamp

### Cross-links Added (FROM other articles TO cognitive-aversion)
1. [[death-void]] - In the psychological evidence section discussing Terror Management Theory
2. [[thoughts-that-slip-away]] - In the content-specific slippage section
3. [[defended-territory]] - In the psychological defense mechanisms section
4. [[existentialism]] - In the authenticity section discussing Heidegger's fallenness
5. [[mysterianism]] - In the phenomenology of cognitive closure section
6. [[death-and-consciousness]] - In the opening section after discussing the death void
7. [[phenomenology-of-the-edge]] - In the "cognitive limits have experiential signatures" section

## Remaining Items

None. The article was already well-structured; the primary gap was orphan status, now resolved.

## Stability Notes

This is the first review of this document. The article is well-positioned conceptually within the voids framework. The core distinction between "motivational closure" and "architectural closure" is valuable and should be preserved in future reviews. The phenomenological taxonomy (slide, substitution, glaze, discomfort, rationalization) represents a distinctive contribution.

The "What Would Challenge This View?" section is appropriately falsifiable and should not be weakened. Future reviews should not treat philosophical disagreement from materialist personas as critical issues—the article explicitly positions itself within the Map's dualist framework.
