**Date**: 2026-02-06
**Article**: [[phenomenological-evidence|Phenomenological Evidence]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-02-phenomenological-evidence-2|2026-02-02 (integration focus)]]

## Context

This article was recently coalesced (2026-02-06) from two separate articles—`/concepts/phenomenological-evidence/` and `/topics/phenomenological-evidence-methodology/`—into a single unified piece. The coalesced version triggered candidacy for review as a new modification since the last review.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None. The coalesced article integrates content cleanly. No attribution errors, no self-contradictions, no broken references.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Description over length limit**: Was 197 chars, guideline is 150-160. **Resolution applied**: Trimmed to 157 chars while preserving key meaning.
- **Imprecise contemplative tradition reference**: "Hindu yoga" was vague—could refer to many traditions. **Resolution applied**: Changed to "Hindu dhyana (as systematised in Patanjali's Yoga Sutras)" for precision.
- **Missing cross-links**: Article discussed concepts that exist as separate Map pages but weren't linked. **Resolution applied**: Added links to `[[altered-states-of-consciousness]]`, `[[cognitive-phenomenology]]`, and `[[epistemological-limits-of-occams-razor]]`.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist** (Churchland): The "phenomenal content" category may not be real. Previous review marked this as bedrock disagreement — not re-flagged.
- **Hard-nosed physicalist** (Dennett): Heterophenomenology response is already robust (zombie argument engagement added in first review). Not re-flagged.
- **Empiricist** (Popper): Falsification criteria already present from first review. Article adequately addresses what would count as evidence against phenomenological reliability.
- **Buddhist philosopher** (Nagarjuna): Tension between Husserlian transcendental ego and Buddhist anatta remains unexplored. Previous review noted this as future content opportunity, not a flaw in this article.

### Attribution Check
- Husserl: Epoché/bracketing correctly attributed. Dates (1859-1938) verified.
- Varela: Neurophenomenology and mutual constraint correctly attributed to 1996 paper.
- Fox et al. (2012): Meditation/introspective accuracy claim verified against cited paper.
- Petitmengin: Microphenomenology correctly attributed.
- Dennett: Heterophenomenology accurately characterised as methodological stance.
- Nisbett & Wilson (1977): Correctly described as targeting cognitive processes not phenomenal content.
- No misattributions found.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Front-loaded summary survives truncation with core thesis intact
- Access vs. status distinction is philosophically precise and powerful
- Three-method progression (Husserl → Varela → Petitmengin) tells a compelling methodological story
- Five reliability criteria are well-structured with concrete examples
- Honest Limitations section acknowledges real constraints proportionately
- Strong tenet connections (Dualism, Bidirectional Interaction, Occam's Razor Has Limits)
- Zombie argument engagement with Dennett (from first review) remains effective
- Falsification criteria (from first review) strengthen empirical credibility

### Enhancements Made
- Trimmed description to 157 chars (was 197)
- Replaced vague "Hindu yoga" with precise "Hindu dhyana (as systematised in Patanjali's Yoga Sutras)"
- Added cross-link to `[[altered-states-of-consciousness]]` in contemplative convergence paragraph
- Added cross-link to `[[cognitive-phenomenology]]` in reliability objection's process/content distinction
- Added cross-link to `[[epistemological-limits-of-occams-razor]]` in Relation to Site Perspective
- Added `[[cognitive-phenomenology]]` and `[[altered-states-of-consciousness]]` to frontmatter concepts
- Added `[[epistemological-limits-of-occams-razor]]` to frontmatter related_articles

### Cross-links Added
- [[altered-states-of-consciousness]]
- [[cognitive-phenomenology]]
- [[epistemological-limits-of-occams-razor]]

## Remaining Items

None. Article is well-structured, well-integrated, and addresses its thesis effectively at 1822 words (73% of concepts threshold).

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed three times (two on 2026-02-02, one today). The core content has been stable since the first review. Today's changes were minor: description length, precision of one reference, and three cross-links. The article has reached stability.

Bedrock disagreements from previous reviews remain unchanged:
- Eliminativists will always find "phenomenal content" question-begging — this is a philosophical standoff, not a fixable flaw.
- The Husserlian transcendental ego vs. Buddhist anatta tension is a legitimate topic for a future article, not a deficiency in this one.

Future reviews should find no critical or medium issues unless the article is substantively modified.
