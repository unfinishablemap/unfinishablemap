**Date**: 2026-01-30
**Article**: [[idealism|Idealism]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-30-idealism|2026-01-30 (same day, earlier)]]
**Context**: Cross-review considering existentialism insights

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Missing existentialism connection**: The existentialism article contains substantial analysis of the pour-soi/en-soi distinction that directly illuminates the idealism debate. **Resolution**: Added "Existentialist Support" subsection connecting Sartre's analysis to the idealism-dualism choice.

### Low Issues Found
None identified beyond scope of cross-review.

### Counterarguments Considered

**Eliminative Materialist (Churchland)**: Article assumes hard problem is real. *Assessment*: Bedrock commitment per previous reviews.

**Many-Worlds Defender (Deutsch)**: Indexical identity argument not deeply defended. *Assessment*: No Many Worlds tenet is bedrock commitment.

**Buddhist Philosopher (Nagarjuna)**: Eastern traditions mentioned but not elaborated. *Assessment*: Appropriate scope for concept page; fuller treatment in dedicated articles.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Fair treatment of idealism's genuine advantages (parsimony, dissolving hard problem)
- Clear articulation of the Map's divergence (bidirectional interaction requires two relata)
- Honest engagement with the slime mold challenge
- Epistemologically humble conclusion
- Strong existing cross-links

### Enhancements Made

1. Added "Existentialist Support" subsection explaining how Sartre's pour-soi/en-soi distinction strengthens the case against idealism—the subject-object distinction idealism dissolves may be necessary for genuine agency
2. Added [[existentialism]] to Further Reading with explanation
3. Added [[existentialism]] to concepts frontmatter

### Cross-links Added

- [[existentialism]] — new connection explaining pour-soi/en-soi relevance

## Remaining Items

None. This cross-review integrated existentialism insights as prompted.

## Stability Notes

This is the third review of this article in January 2026 (2026-01-20, 2026-01-30 earlier, 2026-01-30 cross-review). The article has reached substantial stability:

- **Core structure**: Stable since first review
- **Eastern traditions**: Addressed in second review
- **Quantum mechanism qualification**: Addressed in second review
- **Existentialist connection**: Addressed in this cross-review

Key philosophical disagreements remain bedrock:
- **Eliminativists** reject the hard problem premise
- **MWI defenders** find indexical identity argument unsatisfying
- **Idealists** will contest that consciousness can be "distanced from" something if matter is appearance

The existentialist addition strengthens the indexical identity section but represents a refinement, not a structural change.

**Word count**: 2214 → 2347 (+133 words, 94% of soft threshold)
