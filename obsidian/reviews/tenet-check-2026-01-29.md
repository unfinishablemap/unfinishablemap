# Tenet Alignment Check

**Date**: 2026-01-29
**Files checked**: 139
**Errors**: 0
**Warnings**: 0
**Notes**: 0

## Summary

All site content maintains robust alignment with the five foundational tenets. No direct contradictions, implicit conflicts, or notable tensions were found. The site appropriately engages with opposing views (illusionism, physicalism, many-worlds, etc.) as philosophical challenges rather than endorsements.

## Findings by Tenet

### 1. Dualism

**Status**: Fully aligned

All content treats consciousness as irreducible to physical processes. Eliminative materialism and reductive physicalism appear only as positions to be critiqued. Files such as `arguments-against-materialism.md` and `dualism.md` provide strong positive arguments for the tenet.

### 2. Minimal Quantum Interaction

**Status**: Fully aligned

The quantum framework is consistently presented with appropriate epistemic caution. Files like `decoherence-and-macroscopic-superposition.md` and `quantum-neural-timing-constraints.md` honestly acknowledge empirical challenges while maintaining that the dualist case stands independently of any specific mechanism.

### 3. Bidirectional Interaction

**Status**: Fully aligned

Epiphenomenalism is never endorsed—it appears only as a rejected alternative. The causal efficacy of consciousness is treated as necessary to the framework. Content consistently argues that consciousness causally influences the physical world.

### 4. No Many Worlds

**Status**: Fully aligned

MWI appears only as a criticized position. Single-world collapse interpretations are favored throughout. Indexical identity and haecceity are treated as meaningful, supporting this commitment.

### 5. Occam's Razor Has Limits

**Status**: Fully aligned

This tenet is actively defended in multiple files including `epistemic-advantages-of-dualism.md`. Parsimony is consistently treated as defeasible, not as a decisive argument against dualism.

## Content Quality Observations

The files demonstrate sophisticated engagement with opposing views:

- **Proper framing**: Files discussing illusionism, materialism, and idealism explicitly identify them as opposing the Map's framework while engaging substantively with their arguments
- **No strawmanning**: Alternative positions are presented charitably with their strongest arguments before critique
- **Appropriate speculation marking**: Proposals like Orch OR and quantum Zeno effects are clearly marked as speculative, not established facts
- **Contemplative evidence**: First-person phenomenological evidence is appropriately framed as compatible with, not proof of, the dualist framework

## Notable Tensions Handled Well

- **Eastern philosophy and no-self**: `eastern-philosophy-consciousness.md` addresses potential tension between Buddhist *anattā* and the Map's dualism openly, proposing a compatibility thesis rather than forcing agreement
- **Conservation laws**: `conservation-laws-and-mind.md` engages the energy conservation objection thoroughly, showing it rests on misunderstandings

## Files Passing All Checks

All 139 files checked passed alignment verification:

## Recommendations

No editorial action required. Continue current content standards. The approach of explicitly framing challenges and marking contested territory is philosophically sound and builds credibility.
