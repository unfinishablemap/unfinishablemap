**Date**: 2026-02-25
**Article**: [[phenomenal-consciousness|Phenomenal Consciousness]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-25-phenomenal-consciousness|2026-01-25]]

## Context

Since the previous review (2026-01-25), this article was:
1. Enhanced with ~800 words of new content (deep review additions)
2. Had meta descriptions added (2026-01-26)
3. Condensed from 3582 to 1781 words (2026-02-03)
4. Had bare wikilinks qualified for colliding slugs (2026-02-21)

The condensation was substantial and well-executed, preserving all essential content from the first review's enhancements while cutting redundancy and tightening prose.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Personas Applied

1. **Eliminative Materialist** (Churchland): P-consciousness treated as self-evident datum — bedrock disagreement with site's dualist position, not a flaw
2. **Hard-Nosed Physicalist** (Dennett): A/P distinction correctly presented; phenomenal overflow appropriately hedged; PCS section accurate
3. **Quantum Skeptic** (Tegmark): Quantum mechanisms hedged as "one possible interface" — no overclaiming
4. **Many-Worlds Defender** (Deutsch): No Many Worlds section clearly framed as Map's tenet position — bedrock disagreement
5. **Empiricist** (Popper): Zombie conceivability properly attributed to Chalmers; counterarguments acknowledged
6. **Buddhist Philosopher** (Nagarjuna): Unified subject assumed — bedrock disagreement noted in previous review

### Critical Issues Found
- None

### Medium Issues Found
- **Broken wikilink**: `[[voluntary-attention]]` in frontmatter concepts list — no file with this exact slug exists. Actual file is `voluntary-attention-control-mechanisms.md`. *Resolution: Fixed to `[[voluntary-attention-control-mechanisms]]`*

### Counterarguments Considered
- All major counterarguments from the previous review remain adequately addressed
- Illusionism engagement is balanced (acknowledges valid insights while explaining why the Map disagrees)
- Phenomenal overflow evidence remains properly hedged

## Attribution Accuracy Check

### All Checks Passed
- Block (1995) quotes and P/A distinction attribution: accurate
- Nagel (1974) "what it is like" formulation: accurate
- Chalmers hard problem, zombie conceivability, master argument against PCS: accurate
- Jackson's Mary's Room: accurate
- PCS versions (Loar, Papineau, Balog): correctly identified
- McGinn mysterianism: accurate summary of 1989 paper
- Nagel's View from Nowhere: accurate
- No dropped qualifiers detected
- No source/Map conflation detected
- No self-contradictions detected

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Personas Applied

1. **Property Dualist** (Chalmers): Praised clear PCS presentation and master argument accuracy
2. **Quantum Mind Theorist** (Stapp): Appropriate hedging of quantum mechanisms noted approvingly
3. **Phenomenologist** (Nagel): Strong opening with concrete examples; effective objectivity section
4. **Process Philosopher** (Whitehead): Noted panpsychism cross-link opportunity (deferred — not essential for article scope)
5. **Libertarian Free Will** (Kane): Free will connection present and concise
6. **Mysterian** (McGinn): Mysterian caveat section effective and well-connected to Occam's Razor Has Limits

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent front-loaded opening summary with concrete examples (red, coffee, pain)
- Clean A/P distinction with effective "feel like" vs "what information does" contrast
- PCS + Chalmers master argument section is sophisticated and accurate
- Illusionism section balances fair engagement with clear critique
- Mysterian caveat adds nuance without undermining dualist position
- Comprehensive Relation to Site Perspective touching all 5 tenets
- Extensive cross-linking via wikilinks
- Strong reference section with accurate citations

### Enhancements Made
- Fixed broken `[[voluntary-attention]]` wikilink in frontmatter

### Cross-links Added
- None needed — article already has excellent cross-linking

## Remaining Items

None. The article is in excellent shape after its review + condensation cycle.

## Stability Notes

This article has reached stability after one deep review (2026-01-25) plus condensation (2026-02-03). The current review found 0 critical issues, 0 attribution errors, and only 1 broken wikilink. Key stability signals:

- **Inverted qualia section**: Thin (4 sentences) but recently condensed from longer version. Expanding would be oscillation — the current version covers the core argument adequately.
- **Panpsychism cross-link**: Absent but not essential for this article's scope, which focuses on P-consciousness itself rather than surveying all responses to the hard problem.
- **Bedrock disagreements**: Eliminative materialists, MWI defenders, and Buddhist philosophers will always disagree with the article's premises. These are fundamental philosophical standoffs, not fixable issues.
- **Lewis reference**: Present in references section without explicit inline citation — supports the argument-from-reason mentions and is appropriate as foundational sourcing.

Future reviews should focus on detecting factual errors or attribution problems rather than attempting structural changes. The article's structure and argumentation are sound.
