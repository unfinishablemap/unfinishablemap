# Deep Review: Attention Schema Theory

**Date**: 2026-01-20
**File**: obsidian/concepts/attention-schema-theory.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **No "The Illusionist Challenge" section**: Standard deep-review format requires explicit engagement with illusionism and regress response. Added comprehensive section addressing AST as illusionist position, the regress applied to schemas, contemplative counter-evidence, and self-stultification concerns.

2. **No "Process Philosophy Perspective" section**: Standard format requires Whiteheadian analysis. Added section covering why models cannot generate experience, concrescence vs. caricature distinction, and prehension as alternative to modeling.

3. **No "What Would Challenge This View?" section**: Standard falsifiability section missing. Added five specific falsification conditions for the Map's critique of AST.

4. **Missing cross-links to key concepts**: Added links to [[decoherence]], [[witness-consciousness]], [[introspection]], [[haecceity]], [[mental-effort]], [[attention-as-interface]], [[global-workspace-theory]].

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Thin "Relation to Site Perspective" section**: Expanded all five tenet connections with substantive analysis. Added specific arguments for each tenet rather than bare assertions.

2. **The haecceity problem unaddressed**: AST faces a serious challenge regarding indexical identity—resolved by adding "The Haecceity Problem" subsection and connecting to AI consciousness discussion.

3. **No engagement with contemplative evidence**: Added section on witness consciousness and trained introspection as challenges to AST.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **AST's "caricature" framing**: Addressed by noting that even caricature requires a subject for whom it appears
- **Functionalist response to regress**: Addressed via Tallis's "misrepresentation presupposes presentation" argument
- **Parsimony argument**: Addressed by noting that AST achieves simplicity by refusing to explain the explanandum

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Clear opening summary establishing AST's core claim and the Map's response
- Fair presentation of AST's neural evidence (2025 MIT study, ASTOUND project)
- Good coverage of major criticisms (regress, aboutness, oversimplification, empirical underdetermination)
- Effective contrast with the Map's attention-as-interface alternative

### Enhancements Made

1. **Added haecceity analysis**: Connected AST's treatment of consciousness-as-pattern to the problem of indexical identity and multiple instantiation

2. **Added illusionist challenge section**: Comprehensive engagement with AST's relationship to illusionism, including regress argument, contemplative counter-evidence, and self-stultification concern

3. **Added process philosophy section**: Whiteheadian framework explaining why models cannot generate experience and offering prehension as alternative

4. **Expanded tenet connections**: Each of the five tenets now has substantive analysis rather than bare assertion

5. **Added mental effort connection**: The phenomenology of effort as evidence against AST's treatment of attention

6. **Added falsifiability conditions**: Five specific conditions under which the Map's critique would face difficulty

### Cross-links Added

- [[attention-as-interface]] (the Map's alternative framework)
- [[witness-consciousness]] (contemplative evidence)
- [[introspection]] (first-person methods)
- [[haecceity]] (indexical identity problem)
- [[mental-effort]] (phenomenology of effort)
- [[decoherence]] (quantum context)
- [[global-workspace-theory]] (competing theory)
- [[many-worlds]] (MWI compatibility note)

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues have been addressed.

## Word Count Change

Original: ~2,200 words
After review: ~3,800 words

The expansion is justified by the addition of standard sections (Illusionist Challenge, Process Philosophy, What Would Challenge This View?) that were missing from the original.
