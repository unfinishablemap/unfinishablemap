**Date**: 2026-01-29
**Article**: [[causal-closure|Causal Closure of the Physical]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-29-causal-closure|2026-01-29 (earlier same day)]]
**Context**: Task from outer review to add Observational Closure distinction

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. This review was context-driven to add specific content (Observational Closure distinction from Saad 2025), not a general review.

### Medium Issues Addressed

1. **Missing Observational Closure distinction**: The causal closure page didn't present Saad's crucial distinction between universal closure (the strong claim physics is complete everywhere) and observational closure (the empirical claim that no violations are detectable in experiments). This distinction directly weakens the causal closure objection to dualism.
   - **Resolution**: Added new subsection "Observational vs Universal Closure" under "Problems with the Principle" with:
     - Definition of both closure types
     - Verbatim quote from Saad (2025) defining observational closure
     - Explanation of why the empirical evidence only supports observational closure
     - How this reframes the dialectic (dualists need only respect observational closure)
     - Cross-link to delegatory-dualism.md

### Counterarguments Considered

None new—the addition strengthens an existing argument rather than responding to new objections.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Front-loaded structure
- Existing responses to overdetermination, hidden variables, probabilistic causation
- Stapp mechanism detail
- Testability section

### Enhancements Made

1. **New subsection**: "Observational vs Universal Closure" (~200 words)
2. **Saad reference**: Added to References section
3. **Condensation**: Trimmed "Arguments from Reason" and "Causal Closure and Free Will" sections to maintain length neutrality

### Cross-links Added

- `[[delegatory-dualism|Saad's delegatory framework]]` in new subsection

## Length Management

Article was above soft threshold; operated in length-neutral mode:
- **Before**: 3419 words
- **Added**: ~200 words (Observational Closure subsection)
- **Trimmed**: ~300 words (Arguments from Reason, Free Will sections)
- **After**: 3321 words
- **Net change**: -98 words

## Remaining Items

None. The task (add Observational Closure distinction per outer review) is complete.

## Stability Notes

This article had reached good stability in the previous review (2026-01-29 earlier). This review was a targeted enhancement per the outer review task, not a general re-review. The core arguments and structure remain stable.
