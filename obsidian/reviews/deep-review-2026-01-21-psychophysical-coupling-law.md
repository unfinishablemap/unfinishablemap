**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None critical. The existing article was well-structured with strong philosophical content.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing Decoherence Challenge section**: Article discussed quantum mechanisms without directly addressing the main physics objection. **Resolution**: Added comprehensive "The Decoherence Challenge" section with three mitigating considerations (disputed timescales, Zeno mechanism speed, biological quantum precedents).

- **Missing Illusionist Challenge section**: Standard deep-review section was absent. **Resolution**: Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section with three responses (regress problem, introspection survives, functional asymmetry).

- **Missing Contemplative Evidence section**: No phenomenological data from meditation traditions. **Resolution**: Added section covering phenomenology of attention, effort and selection distinctions, and Buddhist complication regarding selfless selection.

- **Missing Process Philosophy Perspective**: Standard framework connection was absent. **Resolution**: Added section on concrescence as selection, eternal objects as coupling variables, and why process philosophy dissolves the interaction problem.

- **Missing What Would Challenge This View section**: No falsifiability conditions specified. **Resolution**: Added 5 specific conditions under which the framework would fail.

- **Thin Relation to Site Perspective**: Section covered 4 tenets but briefly. **Resolution**: Expanded all 5 tenet connections with substantive analysis, including specific arguments for why coupling laws are necessary and how they address objections.

### Counterarguments Considered
- Tegmark's decoherence objection → addressed with three mitigations
- Illusionist deflation → addressed with regress, introspection, and functional asymmetry arguments
- Functionalist sufficiency → addressed in falsifiability section
- Parsimony objection → addressed in expanded Occam's Razor tenet section

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear articulation of the coupling law problem with four specific requirements
- Excellent coverage of Chalmers' framework including recent Chalmers-McQueen quantum work
- Strong presentation of Stapp's selection mechanism
- Well-structured candidate coupling laws (four families)
- Bandwidth constraint section with empirical grounding
- "What's Not Selectable" section distinguishing position from psychokinesis claims
- Testing approaches section

### Enhancements Made
1. Added "The Decoherence Challenge" section (4 paragraphs)
2. Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section (4 paragraphs)
3. Added "Contemplative Evidence" section with 3 subsections
4. Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section with 3 subsections
5. Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section (5 falsifiability conditions)
6. Expanded "Relation to Site Perspective" from brief coverage to substantive analysis of all 5 tenets
7. Added 5 new concept cross-links in frontmatter
8. Added 3 new references
9. Expanded Further Reading section

### Cross-links Added
- [[decoherence]]
- [[illusionism]]
- [[introspection]]
- [[witness-consciousness]]
- [[mental-effort]]

## Remaining Items

None. All standard deep-review sections now present. Article comprehensively addresses the coupling law problem with appropriate challenges, responses, and connections to site framework.
