## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Libet reference missing**: Libet referenced by name in the Veto section but missing from references; "readiness potential" used without definition; Libet not identified for readers. **Resolution**: Added brief context identifying Libet and his experiments, defined readiness potential, added Libet (1985) citation to references.
- **Schwartz & Begley unused**: Listed in references but never cited in the article text. **Resolution**: Connected to the Adaptive Control open question, citing their OCD neuroplasticity findings as evidence that the controller can reshape the plant.
- **Promissory claims**: The "What Control Theory Adds" section claims control theory adds stability analysis and degradation modes, but offers analogies rather than formal results. **Deferred**: This is acknowledged in Open Questions (formal specification, stability conditions) and is a future research direction rather than a fixable issue.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist**: Five control operations are interpretive mappings, not formal derivations from control theory. The "Analogy, Model, and Ontology" section already addresses this honestly — acknowledged as a modelling tool, not evidence.
- **Hard-nosed physicalist**: The mapping table assumes qualia as sensors, which begs the question. Again, the "Analogy, Model, and Ontology" section correctly notes physicalists can use the same framework.
- **Quantum skeptic**: "Quantum selection mechanism" as actuator is the weakest link. The article hedges appropriately ("however it physically operates") and the writing style guide requires restraint here.
- **MWI defender**: The claim that "under many-worlds, both outcomes occur; the control signal has no genuine effect" slightly overstates the case (in MWI, the controller's branch still matters from its perspective). However, this is a standard philosophical standoff given the Map's tenet commitments.
- **Empiricist**: Promises of formal results (stability analysis, degradation modes) remain analogical. Honestly acknowledged in Open Questions.
- **Buddhist philosopher**: Assumes a unified persisting controller. Outside the Map's scope.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- "Analogy, Model, and Ontology" section — outstanding model for handling framework-vs-ontology distinctions; prevents the article from committing the category error it warns about
- Opening summary — excellent front-loading, direct, clearly states the article's purpose
- Mapping table — clear and useful reference for the control theory ↔ Map framework correspondence
- Five control operations — give concrete, actionable content to abstract claims about conscious will
- "What Control-Theoretic Will Is Not" section — clear boundary-drawing against functionalism, computationalism, eliminativism
- Bandwidth-as-design-feature reframing — sophisticated insight (thermostat, pilot analogies)
- "You decide *what* to do, not *how* to do it" — novel articulation of coarse-grained conscious will
- Phenomenological grounding — mental effort "feels like holding something in place against forces pulling it away"

### Enhancements Made
- Added Libet context and identification in Veto section (self-containment per style guide)
- Added Libet (1985) citation to references
- Connected Schwartz & Begley (2002) to Adaptive Control open question
- Added [[concept-of-free-will]] to Further Reading section

### Cross-links Added
- [[concept-of-free-will]] (Further Reading)

## Remaining Items

- The "What Control Theory Adds" claims remain analogical rather than formal. This is a research direction, not a current fixable issue — tracked in the article's own Open Questions section.
- References include Cisek (2007), Meister (2024), and Wiener (1948) without inline citations. These function as background references rather than cited sources. Minor style concern, not worth disrupting the article to address.

## Stability Notes

- **MWI philosophical standoff**: MWI proponents will always contest the claim that "the control signal has no genuine effect" under many-worlds. This is a bedrock disagreement arising from the Map's No Many Worlds tenet, not a flaw to fix.
- **Physicalist adoption**: The article explicitly acknowledges physicalists can use the same control vocabulary. Materialist critics will always object that the ontological claim (non-physical controller) doesn't follow from the model. The "Analogy, Model, and Ontology" section already handles this with intellectual honesty. Future reviews should not re-flag this.
- **Quantum mechanism speculation**: The actuator (quantum selection) remains the most speculative element. The article hedges appropriately. Unless new evidence changes the picture, this need not be re-flagged.
