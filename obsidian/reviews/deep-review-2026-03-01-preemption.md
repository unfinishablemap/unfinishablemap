**Date**: 2026-03-01
**Article**: [[preemption|Preemption]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-20-preemption|2026-02-20]]

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. Attribution checks all pass. "Default causal profile" qualifier preserved. Saad's framework correctly attributed. Source/Map separation clear. No factual errors, internal contradictions, or missing required sections.

### Medium Issues Found
- **AI refinement log still present**: Lines 114-124 contained a log marked "This log should be removed after human review." The article had been deep-reviewed on 2026-02-20. **Resolution**: Removed the log.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist**: Preemption presupposes mental/physical ontological divide—bedrock disagreement, as previous review noted.
- **Physicalist (Dennett)**: "What grounds the hierarchy?" question is addressed by the article's honest acknowledgment that preemption is a metaphysical interpretation resting on philosophical arguments. Previous review addressed this.
- **Empiricist**: Unfalsifiability concern now transparently addressed in the Observational Closure paragraph. Previous review addressed this.
- **Buddhist**: Clean individuation of causes is a bedrock metaphysical disagreement, as previous review noted.

## Attribution Accuracy Check

All checks passed (unchanged from previous review):
- "Default causal profile" qualifier preserved correctly throughout
- Subset Law* and Delegatory Law accurately described
- Saad's framework correctly attributed; Map-specific claims clearly labeled in Relation to Site Perspective
- Lewis (1973, 2000), Schaffer (2000), Kim (2005) correctly attributed
- No misattributions, dropped qualifiers, overstated positions, or self-contradictions

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent front-loaded opening paragraph
- Clear assassin examples for early and late preemption
- Major/sergeant analogy for trumping preemption
- Consistent and correct use of "default causal profile" qualifier
- Clean separation between Saad's claims and Map's interpretation
- Honest epistemic status acknowledgment (metaphysical interpretation, not empirically testable)
- Well-structured progression: causation literature → philosophy of mind → site perspective

### Enhancements Made
- **Removed stale AI refinement log**: Log was marked for removal after human review; article had been deep-reviewed.

### Cross-links Added (Orphan Integration)
The primary focus of this review was integrating preemption.md into the site navigation. The article had zero inbound wikilinks. Added `[[preemption]]` links in 6 articles:

- [[mental-causation]] — Added `[[preemption|preempt]]` inline link (line 98) + frontmatter concept
- [[delegatory-dualism]] — Added `[[preemption|preempts]]` inline link (line 97) + frontmatter concept + Further Reading entry
- [[objections-to-interactionism]] — Added `[[preemption|preempts]]` inline link (line 249) + frontmatter concept + Further Reading entry
- [[causal-closure]] — Added `[[preemption|preempt]]` inline link (line 107) + frontmatter concept
- [[interactionist-dualism]] — Added `[[preemption|preempted]]` inline link (line 116)
- [[consciousness-and-agency]] (apex) — Added `[[preemption|preempt]]` inline link (line 120)

## Remaining Items

None. The article has converged to a stable state. The orphan integration task is complete.

## Stability Notes

- All stability notes from the 2026-02-20 review remain valid:
  - Eliminativist and Buddhist objections are bedrock metaphysical disagreements, not fixable article flaws.
  - The falsifiability tension with observational closure is transparently addressed. Future reviews should not re-flag this.
- The article is well below the soft word limit (1449/2500) and could accommodate expansion if future content development warrants it.
- After two reviews with no critical issues and minimal changes needed, this article has reached stability. Future reviews should focus on other content unless the article is substantively modified.
