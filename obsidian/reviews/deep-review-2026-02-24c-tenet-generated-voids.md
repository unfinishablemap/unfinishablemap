**Date**: 2026-02-24
**Article**: [[tenet-generated-voids|Tenet-Generated Voids]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-24b-tenet-generated-voids|2026-02-24]]

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Six adversarial personas engaged with the content. Context: cross-review in light of new `substrate-void`, `the-surplus-void`, and `the-givenness-void` articles.

1. **Eliminative Materialist**: No new issues. Substrate void deepens the Nature Void but doesn't change the self-inflicted-voids critique. *Bedrock disagreement — stable across four reviews.*
2. **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: Surplus void adds an interesting wrinkle (consciousness is simultaneously undetectable AND extravagantly rich), but the article already acknowledges suspicious fine-tuning. *No new issue.*
3. **Quantum Skeptic**: No change from new voids. Mechanism Void remains as characterized. *Stable.*
4. **Many-Worlds Defender**: No change. Selection Void already strengthened with indexical and plurality connections. *Stable.*
5. **Empiricist**: Substrate void's 400-year history of failure supports the "Unexplorable" classification. Supporting evidence, not an issue. *Stable.*
6. **Buddhist Philosopher**: Givenness void's felt-immediacy analysis echoes Buddhist critique of the natural attitude. Philosophical connection, not article flaw. *Stable.*

### Critical Issues Found
None. Fourth consecutive review with no critical issues.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing cross-link to substrate-void**: The Nature Void section discusses characterisation failure. The substrate-void article is the dedicated deep-dive. *Resolution*: Added inline reference connecting Nature Void to `[[substrate-void]]`.
- **Missing cross-links to surplus-void and givenness-void**: New void articles in the framework. *Resolution*: Added all three to Further Reading and related_articles.

### Counterarguments Considered
All counterarguments from previous reviews remain bedrock disagreements. No new counterarguments emerged from the three new void articles.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

Six sympathetic personas identified strengths:

1. **Property Dualist**: Substrate void is the dedicated companion article to the Nature Void — inline reference helps readers find the detailed treatment
2. **Quantum Mind Theorist**: No specific insights from new voids
3. **Phenomenologist**: Givenness void adds another dimension to Nature Void's "hitting a wall" phenomenology, but Further Reading link is sufficient — the section is already well-grounded
4. **Process Philosopher**: Surplus void's connection to bidirectional interaction (why full richness for minimal quantum interaction?) is already touched on by the Detection Void section
5. **Libertarian Free Will Defender**: No specific insights
6. **Mysterian**: Substrate void's "conceptual closure" argument strengthens McGinn's position, already represented in References

### Strengths Preserved
- Five-void/five-tenet parallel structure
- "What the tenet says / What it cannot answer" format
- Phenomenological grounding in Nature Void section
- Honest self-critique (Epistemic Privilege Void)
- Reflexive structure in Relation to Site Perspective
- Selection Void → indexical void and plurality void connections
- Binding void connection in Nature Void

### Enhancements Made
- Connected Nature Void to substrate void — the dedicated deep-dive companion article
- Added `[[substrate-void]]`, `[[the-surplus-void]]`, `[[the-givenness-void]]` to Further Reading
- Tightened prose in Mechanism Void, Nature of These Limits, Completeness Void, and Comparative Context to maintain length neutrality

### Cross-links Added
- [[substrate-void]]
- [[the-surplus-void]]
- [[the-givenness-void]]

## Length Management

- **Before**: 1967 words (98% of 2000 soft threshold)
- **After**: 1972 words (99% of 2000 soft threshold)
- **Mode**: Length-neutral — additions balanced with prose tightening
- Trimmed: Mechanism Void candidates list restructured; "nearly 400 years without a satisfying answer" removed from Nature of These Limits; Completeness Void tightened; Comparative Context consolidated into single sentence

## Remaining Items

None.

## Stability Notes

This is the fourth review finding no critical issues. The article is fully stable.

All bedrock disagreements from previous reviews remain unchanged:
- **Eliminative materialist objection**: Self-inflicted voids — fundamental disagreement
- **MWI defender objection**: Indexical questions as manufactured — different metaphysical framework
- **Buddhist non-self objection**: Competing ontology, not article flaw
- **Divine hiddenness parallel**: Article acknowledges the suspicion honestly
- **Epistemic Privilege Void**: Transparency vs. hiding resolution remains adequate

**Future review guidance**: This article has been reviewed four times in one day. It is fully stable. Future reviews should only occur when *new void articles* are created that warrant cross-linking. Do not re-examine the five-void/five-tenet mapping, cross-tenet voids, or philosophical foundations — these have been validated across four reviews.
