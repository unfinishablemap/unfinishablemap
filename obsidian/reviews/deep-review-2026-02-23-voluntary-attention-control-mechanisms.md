## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Zeno timescale gap unacknowledged**: The Temporal Dynamics section referenced Stapp's quantum Zeno interpretation without noting the severe timescale gap (femtosecond observations vs. millisecond attention) that the Map's own consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns article acknowledges. **Resolution**: Added explicit qualification about the gap, the need for intermediate mechanisms, and the 2024 cryptochrome precedent as partial biological evidence.
- **Spectral signatures table uncited**: Frequency bands for consciousness (55-65 Hz), attention (75-90 Hz), and willed decision (theta) were presented without attribution. **Resolution**: Added source column to table citing Koch & Tsuchiya 2007 and Rajan et al. 2019; added Koch & Tsuchiya to References section.
- **Granger causality unattributed**: The bidirectional theta-band coherence claim in Network Reorganization lacked explicit attribution. **Resolution**: Added "(Rajan et al. 2019)" citation inline.
- **Stochastic pre-state response slightly hand-wavy**: The claim that consciousness selects "at a resolution below EEG measurement" risked unfalsifiability. **Resolution**: Reworded to explicitly acknowledge this as a limitation for future empirical confirmation rather than presenting it as a clean accommodation.
- **Occam's section could engage materialist counter more directly**: The "more computation" explanation for additional frontal recruitment deserved explicit engagement. **Resolution**: Rewrote to name the materialist response and explain precisely why it leaves a gap (phenomenal character of effort unexplained by computational complexity alone).

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist**: Neural mechanisms described could simply *be* willed attention—no separate consciousness intervening. Addressed through Occam's section improvements: additional computation doesn't explain why this computation feels effortful.
- **Physicalist**: Selection "below EEG measurement" is unfalsifiable. Addressed by making the epistemic limitation transparent.
- **Quantum skeptic (Tegmark)**: Zeno timescale gap. Addressed by adding explicit qualification and noting the gap honestly.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Three-component framework (frontal decision, network reorganization, stochastic pre-state) provides structured empirical engagement
- Concrete phenomenological example in salience network section ("absorbed in reading; thought about dinner arises")
- Temporal dynamics table with philosophical implications column
- Thalamic relay as "candidate selection site" with appropriately tentative language
- Bidirectional coherence finding effectively supporting bidirectional interaction tenet
- Balanced treatment of stochastic pre-state challenge (both interpretations presented fairly)

### Enhancements Made
- Added cross-link to [[structure-of-attention]] in opening paragraph for readers wanting the three-mode taxonomy
- Added wikilink to [[attention-as-interface|interface hypothesis]] in spectral signatures section
- Added Koch & Tsuchiya 2007 reference for spectral dissociation claims
- Added Zeno timescale gap qualification with cryptochrome biological precedent
- Strengthened Occam's section by directly naming and engaging the materialist "more computation" counter

### Cross-links Added
- [[structure-of-attention]] (opening paragraph)
- [[attention-as-interface]] (spectral signatures section)

## Remaining Items

None. All medium issues addressed. No critical issues found.

## Stability Notes

The following represent expected philosophical disagreements, not fixable problems:
- **Eliminative materialists** will always argue that neural mechanisms fully constitute willed attention without residual need for consciousness. The article addresses this through the phenomenology-of-effort argument but cannot resolve a bedrock disagreement about whether phenomenology requires non-physical explanation.
- **Quantum skeptics** will find the Zeno mechanism speculative. The article now honestly acknowledges the timescale gap rather than glossing over it. The gap is a genuine open problem, not a flaw in the article's presentation.
- **Dennett-style physicalists** will view the "below EEG measurement" framing as unfalsifiable. The revised text now transparently flags this limitation. Future reviews should not re-flag unless the article reverts to presenting it as unproblematic.
