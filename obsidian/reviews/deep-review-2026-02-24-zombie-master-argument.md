**Date**: 2026-02-24
**Article**: [[zombie-master-argument|The Zombie Master Argument]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. Attribution accuracy check passed on all counts — Chalmers, Jackson, Levine, and Kripke all accurately credited. Type-Q correctly flagged as non-standard nomenclature. Source/Map separation clean. No self-contradictions.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Frontmatter path inconsistency**: `[[concepts/materialism]]` and `[[concepts/functionalism]]` used path prefixes inconsistent with all other concept links. **Resolution**: Fixed to `[[materialism]]` and `[[functionalism]]`.
- **"The gap seems to widen" (contested claim)**: Original phrasing presented as fact that the explanatory gap is widening. **Resolution**: Replaced with balanced framing — "Type-A advocates argue progress is being made; critics contend the gap has not narrowed."
- **Question-begging phrasing**: "An uncomfortable position for anyone who trusts their own phenomenal judgments" presupposes the reliability of phenomenal judgments, which is precisely what Type-A physicalists dispute. **Resolution**: Replaced with "a position that carries its own explanatory burden, since it must account for the widespread and persistent intuition that zombies are conceivable."
- **No mention of illusionism**: The article mentioned Dennett and Frankish without engaging illusionism as a distinct response, despite `illusionism.md` existing on the site. **Resolution**: Added illusionism as the most developed Type-A position with cross-link.
- **AI refinement log**: HTML comment from prior refine-draft session (2026-02-23) noted "should be removed after human review." **Resolution**: Removed; this deep review supersedes it.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative Materialist**: Conceivability may reflect neuroscientific immaturity, not metaphysical truth. Addressed by balanced phrasing in Type-A section.
- **Dennettian objection**: We systematically misconstrue what we're doing when "conceiving" zombies. Addressed by adding illusionism engagement and removing question-begging phrasing.
- **Quantum skepticism**: "Biasing quantum indeterminacies" in Bidirectional Interaction section is speculative. Acceptable — sits within explicit "Relation to Site Perspective" section presenting the Map's framework.
- **MWI engagement**: No MWI discussion. Acceptable omission — article focuses on the master argument structure; MWI engagement would be scope creep.
- **Empiricist concern**: Reliance on armchair conceivability without falsifiability criteria. The article links to [[conceivability-possibility-inference]] which handles this in detail.
- **Buddhist perspective**: Assumes unified, binary consciousness. Tangential to the article's purpose; noted but not addressed.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Three-step logical architecture — precise and clean
- Subsumption arguments (knowledge arg, explanatory gap, Kripke as special cases) — excellent pedagogical structure
- "Decision tree" framing of physicalist responses
- Bidirectional Interaction section honestly addressing zombie/Tenet 3 tension
- "Ladder that, once climbed, the full framework kicks away" metaphor — philosophically elegant
- Two-dimensional semantics section
- Type-Q transparency note
- Front-loaded opening paragraph with strong thesis

### Enhancements Made
- Added [[illusionism]] cross-link and engagement as most developed Type-A position
- Balanced the empirical claim about explanatory gap progress
- Improved epistemic fairness of "Why the Argument Resists Defeat" section
- Cleaned up frontmatter concept paths for consistency
- Removed superseded refinement log

### Cross-links Added
- [[illusionism]] (new body cross-link in Type-A section)

## Remaining Items

None. The article is in good shape. Potential future work:
- Could add Block & Stalnaker (1999) to references for phenomenal concepts strategy
- Two-dimensional semantics section could benefit from a brief inline explanation for non-specialist readers
- Could note Kripke's own caution about extending his modal argument to substance dualism

## Stability Notes

The six adversarial personas disagree with the article's dualist conclusions as expected. These are bedrock philosophical disagreements, not flaws:
- Eliminative materialists will always consider zombie conceivability unreliable
- Dennettians will always consider the conceivability illusory
- Empiricists will always want falsifiability criteria for thought experiments
- Buddhist philosophers will question the unified consciousness assumption

Future reviews should NOT re-flag these as critical issues. The article engages with them fairly and takes its position transparently.
