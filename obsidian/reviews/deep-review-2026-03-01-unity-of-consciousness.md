**Date**: 2026-03-01
**Article**: [[unity-of-consciousness|The Unity of Consciousness]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-25-unity-of-consciousness|2026-02-25]]
**Context**: Cross-review considering entanglement-binding-hypothesis insights. The entanglement-binding-hypothesis article was created 2026-03-01 and provides extended treatment of quantum binding including experimental evidence.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. Article is stable from previous review. Attributions accurate, all required sections present, no internal contradictions.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Missing cross-link to [[entanglement-binding-hypothesis]]**: New article created 2026-03-01 provides the extended treatment of quantum binding that this article's quantum binding paragraph points toward. Cross-link was missing.
   - *Resolution*: Added to frontmatter concepts, updated quantum binding paragraph to reference EBH article, added to Further Reading.

2. **Microtubule-specific language in quantum binding paragraph**: Writing style guide advises restraint on microtubule mentions. The paragraph named microtubules specifically when the broader hypothesis is about quantum entanglement in neural processes generally.
   - *Resolution*: Restructured paragraph to reference the entanglement binding hypothesis as the developed proposal, mentioning experimental evidence briefly rather than the specific mechanism. Microtubules now appear only in the experimental evidence summary ("microtubule-stabilising drugs delaying anaesthesia") rather than as the proposed substrate.

### Low Issues Found

1. **quantum-binding-and-phenomenal-unity Further Reading description was generic**: "Quantum entanglement as candidate mechanism" didn't differentiate from the new EBH entry.
   - *Resolution*: Updated to "Structural analysis of quantum binding and phenomenal unity" to distinguish from EBH's experimental focus.

### Counterarguments Considered

All six adversarial personas engaged:
- **Eliminative Materialist**: Illusionist challenge section addresses with unity-as-precondition argument. Bedrock disagreement (per previous reviews).
- **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: Multiple Drafts engagement present (added 2026-02-25). Functionalist identification of access with phenomenal unity is a bedrock disagreement.
- **Quantum Skeptic**: Quantum binding paragraph now uses conditional language and references EBH for evidence rather than asserting mechanism directly. Appropriate hedging maintained.
- **Many-Worlds Defender**: No Many Worlds tenet connection adequate. Bedrock disagreement.
- **Empiricist**: No falsifiability section, covered by extended argument article. Low issue, unchanged from previous review.
- **Buddhist Philosopher**: Subject unity assumption is a bedrock disagreement.

### Attribution Accuracy Check

- Bayne & Chalmers (2003): Subsumptive unity, conjoint phenomenology — **Accurate**
- Husserl: retention/primal impression/protention — **Accurate standard framework**
- Dainton (2000), Lloyd (2012): specious present 100-750ms — **Reasonable range**
- Nagel (1971): Paraphrase form — **Accurate** (fixed in 2026-02-25 review)
- Pinto et al. (2025): Split-brain PNAS study — **Accurate**
- James (1890): "most peculiar puzzle" — **Common attribution, acceptable**
- Dennett (1991): Multiple Drafts — **Accurate**
- No source/Map conflation. No self-contradictions.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Opening paragraph: excellent truncation resilience
- Three-dimension taxonomy (synchronic, diachronic, subject): clean Bayne-Chalmers framework
- Wine-tasting example: vivid phenomenological illustration
- Dissociation evidence: three cases showing dimensions can come apart
- Leibniz's Mill parallel: effective philosophical connection
- Illusionist challenge: unity-as-precondition argument remains compelling
- Multiple Drafts engagement: post-hoc narrative requires narrator
- All five tenets connected substantively in Relation to Site Perspective

### Enhancements Made

1. **Entanglement binding hypothesis cross-link added** (+26 words net): Frontmatter concept, body reference, Further Reading entry
2. **Quantum binding paragraph restructured**: Now references EBH article as the developed proposal with experimental evidence rather than naming microtubules as specific substrate
3. **Further Reading descriptions differentiated**: quantum-binding-and-phenomenal-unity (structural analysis) vs entanglement-binding-hypothesis (testable hypothesis and evidence)

### Cross-links Added

- [[entanglement-binding-hypothesis]] — in frontmatter concepts, body text, and Further Reading

## Word Count

- Before: 1954 words (78% of 2500 soft threshold)
- After: 1980 words (79% of 2500 soft threshold)
- Change: +26 words

Below soft threshold; no length-neutral restrictions applied.

## Remaining Items

1. **Falsifiability section**: Noted in 2026-02-25 review as expansion opportunity (~520 words available before soft threshold). Could be restored in a future standalone review.

## Stability Notes

This is the third review of this article (second of the coalesced version). The article is approaching stability:
- 2026-02-25 review: no critical issues, restored content lost in coalescing
- 2026-03-01 review: no critical issues, cross-review integration with new EBH article

The only changes made were cross-linking to the newly created entanglement-binding-hypothesis article and minor restructuring of the quantum binding paragraph. The article's core arguments, structure, and voice are stable.

Bedrock disagreements (do NOT re-flag in future reviews):
- **Eliminativists** will reject the premise that phenomenal unity exists
- **MWI defenders** will find the indexical argument unsatisfying
- **Functionalists** will identify access unity with phenomenal unity
- **Buddhist philosophers** will challenge subject unity as illusory
