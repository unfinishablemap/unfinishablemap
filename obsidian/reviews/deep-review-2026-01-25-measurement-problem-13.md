# Deep Review: The Measurement Problem

**Date**: 2026-01-25
**File**: obsidian/concepts/measurement-problem.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-25T18:30:00+00:00 (12 reviews today)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Empirical equivalence not explicit**: The article noted the framework is "philosophically compatible with physics" but didn't explicitly state that preserving Born statistics means the theory predicts exactly what standard QM predicts—making them empirically equivalent.
   - **Resolution**: Added "meaning this framework predicts exactly what standard quantum mechanics predicts" to the honest limitation paragraph.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Why dissolution is inadequate unclear**: The MWI response says it "dissolves rather than explains" but didn't articulate what is lost.
   - **Resolution**: Added "the 'view from here'" to articulate the phenomenological fact that dissolution fails to capture.

2. **Minor verbosity in Stapp section**: Some redundant phrasing.
   - **Resolution**: Tightened to offset additions.

### Counterarguments Considered

1. **Eliminativist denial of hard problem**: Noted but not addressed—would require substantial revision outside scope of targeted improvements.

2. **Buddhist no-self challenge to indexical question**: Noted as philosophically interesting but the Map presupposes a theory of self that makes the indexical question meaningful.

3. **Empirical unfalsifiability concern**: Addressed via explicit statement of empirical equivalence.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Opening summary with honest limitation
- Indexical dimension section connecting to hard problem
- Fair treatment of Wallace's MWI derivation
- Balanced Stapp framework discussion
- Multi-observer coordination solution
- Born probabilities section
- All existing cross-links

### Enhancements Made

1. Explicit empirical equivalence statement
2. "View from here" articulation of what dissolution loses
3. Tightened Stapp section prose

### Cross-links Present

All existing cross-links preserved (14 total).

## Word Count

- Before: 2657 words (106% of 2500 target)
- After: 2661 words (106% of 2500 target)
- Change: +4 words

Operated in length-neutral mode: tightened Stapp section to offset additions.

## Remaining Items

None. Given 13 reviews today, the article has reached a high level of quality. Further improvements would require either substantial restructuring or new philosophical insights rather than targeted edits.

## Cumulative Progress (13 reviews)

Key improvements across all reviews today:
- MWI engagement substantially strengthened
- Decoherence objection burden-of-proof clarified
- Heterophenomenology response made fairer
- Born statistics detectability addressed
- Falsification conditions specified
- Empirical equivalence made explicit
- "View from here" articulated
- Length stabilized at 106% of soft threshold
