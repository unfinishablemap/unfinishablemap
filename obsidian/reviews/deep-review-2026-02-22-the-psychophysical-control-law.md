## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **T-shirt problem misattribution**: Article attributed "t-shirt problem" to Jonathan Schaffer; the term originates with Chalmers (1996, p. 214). Schaffer uses the term but credits Chalmers. Fixed: changed attribution to Chalmers with page reference. This same error was caught in the-interface-specification-problem deep review (2026-02-20) and persists in 3 other Map articles (selection-laws, psychophysical-laws, psychophysical-laws-bridging-mind-and-matter).
- **Missing key references**: Article discussed Zeno effect and decoherence timescales without citing Tegmark (2000), the primary source for decoherence calculations in neural systems. Fixed: added Tegmark reference and quantified the timescale challenge.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Physicalism/epiphenomenalism conflation**: Occam's section painted all non-dualist positions as denying consciousness is causally efficacious. Fixed: distinguished physicalist identity theory (which faces the explanatory gap) from epiphenomenalism (which faces the causal disconnection problem).
- **Decoherence treatment too thin**: Single sentence at Stapp limitations was inadequate for an article proposing quantum-level control laws. Fixed: added specific timescale figures (10⁻¹³ to 10⁻²⁰ seconds) and noted available responses.
- **MWI dismissal perfunctory**: Two sentences dismissing a major interpretation on which the article's central claim depends. Fixed: expanded to engage with decision-theoretic MWI response (Wallace 2012) and connected to indexical identity argument.
- **Microtubule study overstated**: Cohen's d = 1.9 result presented without noting classical mechanism alternatives. Fixed: added caveat about microtubule stabilisation affecting cellular transport through classical mechanisms.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist**: Folk-psychological input variables (attention, effort, intention) may not carve nature at its joints. Acknowledged as a genuine concern but not addressed in detail — the Map's framework commits to phenomenal properties as real, making this a bedrock disagreement.
- **Dennett-style physicalism**: The specification gap is self-inflicted — there's nothing to specify because consciousness is physical. The article now more carefully distinguishes this position from epiphenomenalism.
- **Quantum skeptic (Tegmark)**: Decoherence timescales make the Zeno mechanism physically implausible. Now addressed with specific figures and noted responses.
- **Many-worlds defender**: Self-locating uncertainty preserves rational agency under MWI. Now engaged directly with the counter-response that self-locating discovery is not genuine causal influence.
- **Buddhist no-self critique**: The controller metaphor assumes a unified subject. Noted as a deep philosophical disagreement under the Map's tenet commitments.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- "Commitment is not specification" — the four-word framing that structures the article
- The control-theoretic formalisation of Stapp's framework (proportional controller, gain parameter)
- The five constraints any control law must satisfy (bandwidth, conservation, scope, phenomenology, falsifiability)
- Honest treatment of each candidate's limitations
- Strong opening paragraph and tenet connection section
- The three-level analysis of the specification gap

### Enhancements Made
- Added cognitive closure (mysterianism) as a deeper explanation for the specification gap
- Expanded MWI engagement with decision-theoretic response and indexical identity connection
- Quantified decoherence timescale challenge with Tegmark figures
- Distinguished physicalism from epiphenomenalism in Occam's section
- Added caveats to microtubule study evidence
- Added page references to Chalmers quotes

### Cross-links Added
- [[the-interface-specification-problem]] — complementary article on interface location
- [[mysterianism]] — cognitive closure as specification gap explanation
- [[princess-elizabeths-challenge]] — original form of the specification problem
- [[neurophenomenology]] — methodology for constraining phenomenal inputs
- [[explanatory-gap]] — epistemic analogue of the specification gap
- [[indexical-knowledge-and-identity]] — why genuine selection requires irreducible indexical facts
- [[epiphenomenalism]] — distinguished from physicalism in Occam's section

## Remaining Items

- **T-shirt attribution propagation**: The same Schaffer misattribution exists in 3 other articles: selection-laws.md, psychophysical-laws.md, psychophysical-laws-bridging-mind-and-matter.md. These should be fixed in their respective deep reviews.
- **Chalmers quote page reference**: The quote "It would be odd if the universe had fundamental laws..." now has a page reference (p. 214) but this should be verified against the source text.
- **Eliminativist engagement**: The article does not address the eliminativist critique of folk-psychological input variables. This is a medium-priority expansion opportunity for a future review if word count permits.
- **Process 1 (Heisenberg Choice)**: The Stapp section covers the Zeno mechanism but not Process 1 (basis control). This would strengthen the section but was deferred to avoid exceeding length targets.
- **Backlinks from referenced articles**: None of the 7 referenced concept articles link back to this article yet. Future deep reviews of those articles should add the cross-reference.

## Stability Notes

- The eliminativist critique of folk-psychological input variables is a bedrock disagreement. The Map's framework commits to phenomenal properties as real and causally relevant. Future reviews should not flag "attention intensity is not a scientifically legitimate variable" as a critical issue — it is a philosophical standoff.
- The Buddhist no-self critique of the controller metaphor challenges the Map's commitment to a subject-object structure. This is a tenet-level disagreement, not a fixable problem.
- The empiricist concern about unfalsifiability is genuine but inherent to the current state of the field. The article is honest about this. Future reviews should not re-flag "candidate laws are untestable" as critical unless the article claims otherwise.
