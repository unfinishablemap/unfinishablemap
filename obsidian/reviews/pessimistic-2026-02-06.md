## Executive Summary

These three recent articles (all created 2026-02-05) represent the Map's engagement with empirical science—mechanisms of mind-matter coupling, cognitive science's bearing on dualism, and the attention-consciousness dissociation. All are well-structured and argumentatively clear. However, they share a pattern of selectively interpreting empirical evidence as favourable to dualism while understating the strength of physicalist explanations for the same data. The coupling mechanisms article overstates the viability of Stapp's model given decoherence constraints. The cognitive science article commits the same inferential move it accuses physicalists of—reasoning from methodological gaps to ontological conclusions. The dissociation article treats a double dissociation as evidence for dualism when double dissociations are the standard tool of *physicalist* cognitive neuroscience.

## Critiques by Philosopher

### The Eliminative Materialist

**On Psychophysical Coupling Law Mechanisms**: The entire framework of "coupling laws" assumes there is a distinct phenomenal domain that *needs* coupling to physics. This presupposes dualism rather than arguing for it. We don't need coupling laws between "phlogiston" and combustion—we need better chemistry. The five "candidate mechanisms" are five ways of elaborating a category error. The article's specification threshold (phenomenal variable, physical parameter, causal pathway) is designed to make dualism look rigorous, but each "phenomenal variable" (attention, intention, valence) will eventually be fully explained in neural terms. Schwartz's OCD results show that cognitive therapy changes brain states—this is evidence for neuroplasticity, not evidence for a non-physical mind directing quantum events.

**On Cognitive Science of Dualism**: The article argues cognitive science presupposes materialism and therefore can't adjudicate dualism. But cognitive science presupposes materialism because *materialism works*—every prediction, every intervention, every treatment flows from physical-level understanding. The "methodological circle" argument (that cognitive science depends on first-person report) confuses data collection with ontological commitment. Physicists use human observation to record data without concluding that observation is non-physical. First-person reports are verbal behaviours. The article's claim that this "smuggles in an irreducibly first-person element" conflates epistemic access with ontological status.

**On Attention-Consciousness Dissociation**: The article treats "consciousness" as if it refers to a well-defined natural kind. It doesn't. What dissociates from attention is a set of information-processing operations we *call* consciousness due to folk-psychological categories. As neuroscience matures, the term "consciousness" will be replaced by more precise vocabulary, and the apparent dissociation will dissolve into distinct neural subsystems doing different things—none requiring a non-physical explanation.

### The Hard-Nosed Physicalist

**On Psychophysical Coupling Law Mechanisms**: The article is commendably honest about the tiering of mechanisms (Tier 1/2/3), but it fails to draw the appropriate conclusion. When your best mechanism (Stapp) faces a decoherence objection that requires retreating from "freezing superpositions" to "selecting among decoherence-produced alternatives," you haven't saved the theory—you've hollowed it out. The revised mechanism ("consciousness biases which possible outcome becomes actual") is unfalsifiable. How would we distinguish this from ordinary stochastic neural selection? The article acknowledges the gap but treats it as an "open question" rather than a fatal weakening.

**On Cognitive Science of Dualism**: The radio-wave analogy ("concluding radio waves don't exist because a thermometer can't measure them") is misleading. Radio waves were predicted by physical theory before detection. No physical theory predicts non-physical mental causation. The analogy should be: "concluding that ghosts don't exist because ghost-detectors don't work." The article also overstates the significance of cognitive science's dependence on first-person reports. Reports are behavioural outputs. That we *interpret* them as testimony about experience is a pragmatic choice, not evidence of irreducible phenomenality.

**On Attention-Consciousness Dissociation**: Blindsight is not "attention without consciousness"—it's degraded visual processing with residual unconscious capacities. The four-quadrant framework (Koch & Tsuchiya) is heuristically useful but doesn't establish that consciousness is an entity separable from attentional mechanisms. The article leaps from "attention and consciousness can dissociate" to "consciousness is something over and above attentional mechanisms." A physicalist reading: attention and phenomenal access are partially overlapping neural processes. Dissociation shows they use different circuits, not that one is non-physical.

### The Quantum Skeptic

**On Psychophysical Coupling Law Mechanisms**: The article's treatment of the decoherence problem is insufficient. It mentions the Araujo et al. (2014) Monte Carlo result—that quantum Zeno breaks down beyond brain decoherence time—and then offers a "possible response" that shifts the mechanism to "outcome determination after decoherence." This is hand-waving. Decoherence doesn't leave a tidy set of "possible outcomes" for consciousness to choose among—it produces a density matrix that evolves deterministically. The "selection among decoherence-produced alternatives" requires a collapse interpretation, and the mechanism for that collapse is precisely what's in question. You can't solve the measurement problem by inserting consciousness at the point where you need a solution to the measurement problem—that's circular.

The article also cites the Kerskens and Pérez (2022) MRI study as evidence for brain entanglement. This study has not been replicated, and its methodology has been criticized. Citing it alongside the Wiest et al. microtubule study without noting that neither has been independently confirmed presents speculative findings as more established than they are.

**On Attention-Consciousness Dissociation**: The article invokes Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism to explain why mental effort "feels real"—it's "actual engagement" holding neural patterns stable through repeated observation. But Stapp's model requires coherent quantum states lasting long enough for the Zeno effect to operate. Tegmark's decoherence calculations give 10⁻¹³ seconds for relevant neural systems. Attention operates at ~100ms timescales. The mechanism requires bridging ten orders of magnitude. The article presents this as a live option without noting this devastating quantitative mismatch.

### The Many-Worlds Defender

**On Psychophysical Coupling Law Mechanisms**: The article claims that under MWI, "coupling mechanisms have nothing to couple *to*—there's no selection because everything happens." This misrepresents MWI. In many-worlds, the branching structure and probability weighting still require explanation—and the Born rule needs derivation. MWI doesn't say "everything happens equally"—it says branches have different amplitudes, and observers experience outcomes weighted by those amplitudes. The article's dismissal assumes that "selection" requires actual collapse, but decision theory under MWI (Deutsch-Wallace) recovers rational probability assignment without collapse. The article should engage with this rather than asserting that MWI makes selection meaningless.

**On Cognitive Science of Dualism**: The article doesn't discuss MWI, but its framing of quantum measurement as "consciousness selects outcomes" presupposes a collapse interpretation. Under MWI, all measurement outcomes occur—consciousness doesn't select, it branches. The article's background assumption that quantum indeterminacy provides an "opening" for consciousness only works under specific interpretations it doesn't argue for.

### The Empiricist

**On Psychophysical Coupling Law Mechanisms**: The article's specification threshold (phenomenal variable, physical parameter, causal pathway) is admirable—it's trying to make the dualist programme falsifiable. But does it succeed? Stapp's model predicts that "willed attention produces different frontal-parietal signatures than reflexive attention." This is already explained by standard neuroscience without invoking quantum Zeno effects. The prediction doesn't discriminate between Stapp's model and ordinary neuroplasticity accounts. A genuinely testable coupling mechanism would predict something *only* the dualist model explains—and the article doesn't identify such a prediction.

The article acknowledges that valence-as-motivational-force, qualia-as-basis-selection, and unity-as-sustained-entanglement have "no mechanism connecting qualitative character to measurement basis, and no empirical evidence." Three of five candidates are admittedly not even wrong. This is presented as intellectual honesty, but it should be presented as a problem for the programme.

**On Cognitive Science of Dualism**: The article argues that "absence of evidence within a restricted methodology is not evidence of absence." Correct in principle. But the article then infers from this logical point that something positive—non-physical causation—might exist beyond the methodology's reach. This is an unfalsifiable claim. What evidence would convince the Map that non-physical causation doesn't exist? If no evidence could, the position is metaphysical in the Popperian pejorative sense.

**On Attention-Consciousness Dissociation**: The COGITATE 2025 adversarial testing is cited as showing "neither simple functionalist theory captures consciousness." But "not yet captured" is different from "cannot be captured." The article treats the current failure of GWT and IIT as evidence that consciousness resists reduction. A Popperian would note that scientific theories are routinely revised—the failure of current theories is expected in ongoing science, not evidence for non-physical entities.

### The Buddhist Philosopher

**On Psychophysical Coupling Law Mechanisms**: The entire project of specifying a "coupling mechanism" between consciousness and physics reifies both sides of a duality that doesn't exist in the way assumed. Consciousness is not a *thing* that couples to another *thing*. The five candidates all assume a substantial self—an agent that "selects" or "attends" or "intends." But who is this agent? The article never examines whether the self doing the selecting is itself a construction. In dependent origination, consciousness arises in dependence on conditions—it is not an independent agent standing outside the physical and reaching in. The Map's coupling mechanisms are elaborate descriptions of what clinging to selfhood looks like when dressed in quantum physics.

**On Attention-Consciousness Dissociation**: The article uses dissociation evidence to argue that "consciousness is something over and above attentional mechanisms"—a distinct *subject* that uses attention as an interface. This is exactly the permanent self (atman) that Buddhist philosophy has argued against for 2,500 years. The dissociation evidence is equally compatible with the view that "consciousness" is a label for a shifting collection of processes—sometimes attention is among them, sometimes not. No permanent subject is required. The "driver and steering wheel" analogy assumes a driver—but what if there's no driver, only the car?

## Critical Issues

### Issue 1: Unfalsifiable Retreat in Stapp's Model
- **File**: `topics/psychophysical-coupling-law-mechanisms.md`
- **Location**: "Possible responses" paragraph under the decoherence objection (line 77)
- **Problem**: When the Zeno mechanism fails due to decoherence timescales, the article retreats to "consciousness biases which possible outcome becomes actual after decoherence." This revised mechanism has no testable predictions distinct from ordinary stochastic neural processes. The retreat strips the model of its empirical content while maintaining the dualist conclusion.
- **Severity**: High
- **Recommendation**: Explicitly acknowledge that this retreat reduces the mechanism's falsifiability. State what empirical finding would distinguish "consciousness selects among post-decoherence alternatives" from "neural processes are stochastic."

### Issue 2: Double Dissociation Misinterpreted as Evidence for Non-Physical Entity
- **File**: `topics/attention-consciousness-dissociation.md`
- **Location**: "What Dissociation Reveals" section (lines 84-99)
- **Problem**: Double dissociations between attention and consciousness are presented as evidence that consciousness is "something over and above" attentional mechanisms—i.e., non-physical. But double dissociation is the standard method cognitive neuroscience uses to identify *distinct physical processes*. Perception and action dissociate (optic ataxia vs visual agnosia) without anyone concluding that perception is non-physical. The article treats dissociation as dualism-supporting without addressing why it couldn't simply indicate distinct neural circuits.
- **Severity**: High
- **Recommendation**: Add a section explicitly addressing the physicalist interpretation of double dissociation. Argue why consciousness-attention dissociation is different from other double dissociations if possible, or acknowledge the interpretive ambiguity.

### Issue 3: The Radio-Wave Analogy Is Misleading
- **File**: `topics/cognitive-science-of-dualism.md`
- **Location**: Paragraph on methodological assumption (line 41)
- **Problem**: The article compares cognitive science's failure to detect non-physical causation to a thermometer failing to detect radio waves. But radio waves were predicted by electromagnetic theory—there was independent theoretical reason to expect them. No well-confirmed physical theory predicts non-physical mental causation. The analogy obscures this crucial disanalogy: radio waves were part of an established theoretical framework, while non-physical causation is postulated to fill an explanatory gap.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Recommendation**: Acknowledge the disanalogy explicitly. The logical point (absence of evidence ≠ evidence of absence) is valid, but the analogy overstates the case by implying that non-physical causation is as theoretically motivated as radio waves were.

### Issue 4: Selective Use of Empirical Evidence
- **File**: `topics/psychophysical-coupling-law-mechanisms.md`
- **Location**: Lines 114-115 (Kerskens & Pérez, Wiest et al.)
- **Problem**: The article cites the Kerskens and Pérez (2022) MRI study and the Wiest et al. (2024) microtubule study as evidence for quantum effects in the brain. It notes they "require independent replication" but presents them alongside established results without sufficiently flagging their preliminary status. Both are single studies, neither replicated, and Kerskens & Pérez has been questioned methodologically.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Recommendation**: Strengthen the epistemic hedging. Differentiate more clearly between "established experimental results" (quantum Zeno effect in physics) and "single unreplicated studies" (brain entanglement, microtubule effects on anaesthesia).

### Issue 5: Genetic Fallacy Argument Cuts Too Deep
- **File**: `topics/cognitive-science-of-dualism.md`
- **Location**: "The Genetic Fallacy in Both Directions" section (lines 72-78)
- **Problem**: The article correctly identifies the genetic fallacy in using cognitive origins to debunk dualism. But it then argues the same fallacy applies to intuitive materialism, concluding that "Evolution selects for behaviourally useful heuristics, not metaphysical truth." This is too strong—if applied consistently, it undermines *all* evolved cognitive capacities, including the reasoning capacity being used to make this very argument. The article needs to explain why philosophical reasoning can escape the evolutionary debunking it applies to intuitions.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Recommendation**: Add a sentence acknowledging the reflexivity problem. If evolutionary origins debunk intuitions, they potentially debunk the reasoning faculty itself. Distinguish between debunking intuitions and debunking reasoned arguments to avoid self-undermining.

## Counterarguments to Address

### Stapp's Model and Decoherence
- **Current content says**: The Zeno mechanism "might operate not on sustained superpositions but at the point of outcome determination after decoherence has already selected preferred bases."
- **A critic would argue**: This is not a mechanism—it's a promissory note. "Outcome determination" after decoherence is precisely the measurement problem, and inserting consciousness here is circular (consciousness explains collapse, collapse is where consciousness acts). Additionally, the shift from Zeno-based to post-decoherence selection abandons the specific mechanism (rapid observation → Zeno holding) that gave Stapp's model its empirical content.
- **Suggested response**: Be more transparent about the cost of this retreat. Acknowledge that the post-decoherence version is significantly weaker than the original Zeno version and identify what new evidence or theoretical development could restore specificity.

### Dissociation as Evidence for Distinct Physical Processes
- **Current content says**: Dissociation shows "consciousness is something over and above attentional mechanisms."
- **A critic would argue**: Every double dissociation in cognitive neuroscience shows two processes are *physically* distinct—not that one is non-physical. Face recognition and object recognition dissociate; working memory and long-term memory dissociate. None of these dissociations motivate dualism. The consciousness-attention dissociation, absent additional argument, likewise shows only that they are distinct neural processes.
- **Suggested response**: The article needs a "Why this dissociation is different" subsection explaining what makes consciousness-attention dissociation uniquely problematic for physicalism in a way that face-object dissociation is not. The hard problem provides such an argument, but the article doesn't make the connection explicitly enough.

### Cognitive Science's Dependence on First-Person Report
- **Current content says**: Cognitive science "depends on first-person testimony to ground its third-person measurements, creating a methodological circle it cannot close from within."
- **A critic would argue**: All science depends on observer reports—a physicist reads a meter. This doesn't make meter-reading non-physical. The "methodological circle" is universal to empirical science, not specific to consciousness. The article confuses the epistemic role of reports (how we gather data) with the ontological status of what's reported.
- **Suggested response**: Distinguish between reports *about* physical phenomena (where the report's content has physical referents we can independently verify) and reports *about* experience (where the report's content has no independently verifiable referent). The asymmetry is in the subject matter, not in the act of reporting.

## Unsupported Claims

| Claim | Location | Needed Support |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| "Monte Carlo simulations by Araujo et al. (2014) showed that the quantum Zeno effect 'breaks down for timescales greater than the brain decoherence time'" | coupling-mechanisms, line 75 | Direct quote needs page number; need to specify what decoherence time was used in the simulation |
| "the felt quality of attending could modulate a physical process (the frequency of quantum measurements)" | coupling-mechanisms, line 49 | This is presented as what needs to be shown, but the article never returns to explain why this hasn't been shown |
| "Willed attention produces different frontal-parietal signatures than reflexive attention" | coupling-mechanisms, line 73 | No citation provided for this claim; needs specific reference |
| "Lieberman et al. (2008) found that cognitive load on conscious processes specifically impairs logical reasoning" | cognitive-science (via tenets reference) | Not cited in this article's references section |
| "A 2025 eLife study (Nartker et al.) found that inattentionally blind participants retain visual sensitivity" | dissociation, line 51 | Characterised as "the strongest evidence to date"—is this the study's own claim or the article's interpretation? Should clarify |

## Language Improvements

| Current | Issue | Suggested |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| "For this claim to be more than a philosophical posture" (coupling, line 37) | "Philosophical posture" is dismissive of the Map's own tenet | "For this claim to have empirical traction" |
| "Below it, a proposal remains a metaphor" (coupling, line 51) | Too strong; proposals below the threshold are underdeveloped, not metaphors | "Below it, a proposal lacks the specificity needed for scientific engagement" |
| "This tiering matters for the Map's intellectual honesty" (coupling, line 127) | Implies other Map content may lack intellectual honesty | "This tiering matters for calibrating the Map's claims" |
| "The evidence sits most comfortably with views that..." (dissociation, line 99) | Overstates; the evidence is compatible with multiple views | "The evidence is particularly consonant with views that..." |
| "a cognitive bias like the gambler's fallacy" (cognitive-science, line 49) | Potentially unfair characterisation of the debunking position | "a systematic cognitive error" |

## Strengths (Brief)

Despite the criticisms above, these articles have genuine merits worth preserving:

- **The specification threshold** (coupling mechanisms) is a genuinely useful framework. Requiring phenomenal variable + physical parameter + causal pathway disciplines dualist theorising and prevents vague hand-waving. This is the kind of self-imposed rigour that distinguishes serious philosophy from speculation.

- **The tiering of mechanisms** (coupling mechanisms) is admirably honest. Placing three of five candidates in "Tier 3 (phenomenological observation without mechanism)" shows the Map takes its own standards seriously. This transparency should be preserved even as the issues above are addressed.

- **The genetic fallacy argument** (cognitive science) is logically sound and cuts both ways effectively. The symmetry—if cognitive origins debunk dualism, they equally debunk materialism—is a genuine philosophical insight, even if the reflexivity problem needs addressing.

- **The four-quadrant framework** (dissociation) organises complex evidence clearly. Koch and Tsuchiya's matrix is well-presented and the integration of 2024-2025 research updates keeps the article current.

- **The COGITATE 2025 results** (dissociation) are accurately reported and the article draws appropriately measured conclusions from them—noting that neither theory was vindicated rather than overclaiming.

- **Writing quality across all three articles** is strong: front-loaded summaries, clear section structure, substantive "Relation to Site Perspective" sections, and appropriate use of hedging language for speculative claims. The articles model good LLM-first writing.
