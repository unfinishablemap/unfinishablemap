**Date**: 2026-02-01
**Article**: [[visual-consciousness|Visual Consciousness]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None

### Medium Issues Found
- Quantum binding section presented speculation without adequate hedging: **Resolved** — Added "One proposal" framing, explicit "speculative" label, and cross-reference to binding-problem for detailed treatment
- Explanatory gap mentioned conceptually but not linked: **Resolved** — Added wikilink and concept reference

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminativist response**: Article assumes qualia exist without engaging eliminativist objections. **Assessment**: Article scope is appropriate—it's a concept page for visual consciousness, not a defence of qualia. The Map's tenets commit to qualia reality. Adequate engagement exists via blindsight dissociation.
- **Functionalist response** (Dennett): Inverted spectrum coherence contested. **Assessment**: Article presents as conditional ("If this scenario is coherent") which is appropriate hedging.
- **Quantum skeptic response** (Tegmark): Decoherence times too short. **Assessment**: Article appropriately hedges quantum content; detailed treatment in binding-problem page.
- **MWI response**: Visual determinacy compatible with MWI branches. **Assessment**: This is a philosophical standoff, not a flaw. The Map's No Many Worlds tenet is clearly labeled as the Map's position.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent opening summary—front-loaded, truncation-resilient
- "Physics describes wavelengths; it does not describe what redness looks like" — clean quotable summary
- "Correlation is not unity" — key philosophical move in binding section
- "This is not ignorance about neural detail. It's a gap in our conceptual apparatus" — captures explanatory gap clearly
- Phenomenological descriptions throughout (perspectival character, specious present)
- Comprehensive tenet connections in Relation to Site Perspective

### Enhancements Made
- Quantum binding section now explicitly hedged as "one proposal" and "speculative"
- Added cross-reference to [[quantum-consciousness|Orch OR]]
- Added cross-reference to [[binding-problem]] for detailed evidence
- Added [[explanatory-gap]] wikilink in explanatory gap discussion
- Added [[explanatory-gap]] to concepts frontmatter
- Added [[interactionist-dualism]] to related_articles frontmatter

### Cross-links Added
- [[explanatory-gap]]
- [[quantum-consciousness]]
- [[interactionist-dualism]]

## Remaining Items

None — article is well-structured and appropriately scoped for a concept page.

## Stability Notes

The adversarial personas (eliminativist, functionalist, quantum skeptic, MWI defender) represent expected philosophical disagreements with the Map's dualist framework, not fixable flaws. Future reviews should not re-flag these as critical issues. The article takes positions consistent with the tenets while acknowledging alternatives exist.
