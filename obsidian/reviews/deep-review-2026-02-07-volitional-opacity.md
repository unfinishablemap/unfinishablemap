**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Article**: [[volitional-opacity|Volitional Opacity]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Misattributed citation (Haynes 2007 → Soon et al. 2008)**: The seven-second prediction finding was attributed to Haynes et al. (2007) "Reading hidden intentions in the human brain," which was about decoding already-formed intentions, not prediction timing. Corrected to Soon, Brass, Heinze & Haynes (2008) "Unconscious determinants of free decisions in the human brain." *Nature Neuroscience*.
- **Two unattributed block quotes in Mechanistic Opacity**: Quotation marks around paraphrases from secondary/encyclopedia sources ("Since the mind is, on the Cartesian model, immaterial..." and "is problematic because in dualism 'the mind' is assumed to be non-physical..."). Rewritten as the article's own language without quotation marks.
- **Missing qualifier on 7-second claim**: Original stated prediction as if deterministic. Added "at above-chance rates" and "(~60%), not deterministic" to accurately represent Soon et al. findings.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing No Many Worlds tenet connection**: Added new subsection connecting volitional opacity to the No Many Worlds tenet—MWI dissolves the void by eliminating selection, so rejecting MWI preserves volitional opacity as a genuine puzzle.
- **Merleau-Ponty section tension with article thesis**: Reframed as "a fourth interpretation" rather than standalone insight, and added note about compatibility with dualism depending on whether mind operates *through* embodied processes.
- **Thin treatment of Illusion Interpretation**: Added sentence explaining why the Map finds illusionism insufficient (evolution of the illusion demands its own mechanism).
- **Aristotle akrasia quote**: Removed quotation marks from what was likely a modern scholarly paraphrase, rephrased as article's own language.
- **Strawson clarification**: Added parenthetical noting Strawson himself argues the libertarian phenomenology does not ground genuine freedom, preventing misreading of his position.
- **Missing bidirectional cross-link**: Added `[[volitional-opacity]]` to introspective-opacity.md's related_articles.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Engineering limitation argument** (Dennett): opacity may be ordinary design limitation, not ontological gap. Not directly addressed in this review—the Merleau-Ponty reframing partially engages this, but a full response would require expanding beyond word-count threshold.
- **Confabulation undercutting phenomenology**: Already addressed by existing epistemic caveat in phenomenology section (added in prior refinement).
- **AI and cognitive closure**: Whether AI systems with different concept-forming procedures could resolve what humans cannot. Deferred to future work.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening paragraph with "We know *that* we decide; we cannot observe *how* we decide" thesis
- Three-dimensional taxonomy (temporal, process, mechanistic opacity)
- Epistemic caveat in phenomenology section
- Wegner nuance ("did not claim conscious thought cannot cause action")
- "What Would Challenge This View" section with four specific conditions
- Tenet connections (substantive, non-formulaic)
- Akratic revelation argument

### Enhancements Made
- Added No Many Worlds tenet subsection (all five tenets now addressed)
- Strengthened Illusion Interpretation with Map's response
- Added Strawson position clarification
- Reframed Merleau-Ponty as fourth interpretation with dualism compatibility note
- Fixed Soon et al. citation with accuracy qualifier

### Cross-links Added
- [[limits-reveal-structure]] (related_articles + Further Reading)
- [[creativity-void]] (related_articles + Further Reading)
- [[volitional-opacity]] added to introspective-opacity.md (bidirectional link)

## Remaining Items

- The "engineering limitation" counterargument (that opacity is ordinary neural design, not evidence for dualism) is the strongest unaddressed objection. A future review could add a brief response in the Merleau-Ponty section or the tenet connections.
- The meditation convergence claim ("Meditators across traditions report the same finding") remains uncited. A specific contemplative source would strengthen it.
- William James quote ("The rush of thought...") could not be independently verified as verbatim. May be a close paraphrase—low priority but worth checking against *Principles of Psychology* if access is available.

## Stability Notes

- The six adversarial personas all found material to engage with but produced no critical philosophical objections—all critiques were either attribution/factual errors (fixable) or expected philosophical disagreements. The eliminativist, physicalist, and MWI objections are bedrock disagreements with the site's dualist framework, not flaws to fix.
- The article is at 2171 words (109% of 2000 soft threshold). Further additions should be offset by equivalent cuts. The article should be considered near stable length.
- The Merleau-Ponty section may continue to generate tension in future reviews. The reframing as "a fourth interpretation" with a dualism-compatibility note should be treated as the resolution unless new content reintroduces the problem.
