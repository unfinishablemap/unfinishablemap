**Date**: 2026-02-28
**Article**: [[concepts/concept-of-phenomenal-value-realism|Phenomenal Value Realism (Concept)]]
**Previous review**: Never (previous reviews targeted the topic page, not this concept page)
**Context**: Orphan integration — file had no inbound links from content articles

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The article has no factual errors, misattributions, internal contradictions, or missing required sections. All six adversarial personas engaged:

- **Eliminative Materialist**: Illusionist challenge section provides adequate engagement with three responses (regress, introspective survival, self-stultifying). Bedrock philosophical disagreement.
- **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: Self-stultifying response correctly identifies tension in illusionist practice. No issues.
- **Quantum Skeptic**: Minimal Quantum Interaction connection appropriately hedged with conditional "If."
- **MWI Defender**: Token-based value argument against MWI is sound.
- **Empiricist**: Four falsifiability conditions are specific and evaluable.
- **Buddhist Philosopher**: Tension with svabhava acknowledged. Map's response ("experienced as intrinsic") is a considered position.

### Attribution Accuracy

- Rawlette's identity thesis fairly characterized from *The Feeling of Value* (2016)
- Moore's Open Question Argument correctly described
- Nozick's Experience Machine correctly attributed
- Whitehead's actual occasions/subjective form accurate
- Tallis regress attribution reasonable
- Source/Map separation well handled (Rawlette's position vs. Map's pluralist variant clearly distinguished)
- No self-contradictions found

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Orphan status — no inbound links**: The concept page was entirely disconnected from site navigation. All content articles linked to `[[topics/phenomenal-value-realism]]` but never to `[[concept-of-phenomenal-value-realism]]`.
   - **Resolution**: Added cross-references from 4 key articles (see below)

2. **Missing `consciousness-value-connection` in related_articles**: Referenced in body (opening paragraph) but absent from frontmatter.
   - **Resolution**: Added to related_articles along with `[[living-with-the-map]]`

3. **Wolf reference unused**: Wolf (2010) cited in References but not referenced in text.
   - **Resolution**: Deferred — minor reference section issue, not worth adding text just to justify the citation

### Counterarguments Considered

All six adversarial personas found no critical issues. The article is well-structured with strong engagement across objections (Open Question, Experience Machine, Scope Problem) and the illusionist challenge.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Clear opening summary front-loading the identity claim (pleasure *is* value)
- Effective semantic vs. metaphysical identity distinction
- Phenomenal value pluralism table with 7 features
- Three-part illusionist response (regress, introspective survival, self-stultifying)
- Comprehensive five-tenet connections in Relation to Site Perspective
- Process philosophy section providing genuine Whiteheadian depth
- Contemplative evidence (jhana states, cessation contrast)
- Four specific falsifiability conditions

### Enhancements Made

1. Added `[[consciousness-value-connection]]` and `[[living-with-the-map]]` to related_articles frontmatter
2. Added cross-reference from **qualia.md** — in "Why Qualia Matter" section, connecting emotional valence to phenomenal value realism's identity claim
3. Added cross-reference from **consciousness-value-connection.md** — concept page added to concepts list and inline link updated to point to concept page
4. Added cross-reference from **animal-consciousness.md** — in "Moral Status" section, connecting valence sentientism to phenomenal value realism
5. Added cross-reference from **ai-consciousness.md** — in "Alignment Implications" section, grounding experiential quality target in phenomenal value realism

### Cross-links Added

- From [[concepts/qualia]] → [[concept-of-phenomenal-value-realism]]
- From [[concepts/consciousness-value-connection]] → [[concept-of-phenomenal-value-realism]]
- From [[topics/animal-consciousness]] → [[concept-of-phenomenal-value-realism]]
- From [[topics/ai-consciousness]] → [[concept-of-phenomenal-value-realism]]

## Length Analysis

**Word count**: 2324 words (93% of 2500 soft threshold)
**Status**: ok — normal improvements allowed

No length changes made to the concept article itself. Cross-references added to other articles were minimal (1 clause each).

## Remaining Items

None. The primary objective (orphan integration) has been addressed through 4 cross-references from high-traffic articles.

## Stability Notes

The following represent bedrock philosophical disagreements, not fixable problems:

- **Illusionist objection**: Illusionists will reject phenomenal consciousness as the ground of value. The three responses represent the Map's settled position. This disagreement is fundamental and was noted in the topic page's previous review.

- **Preference satisfaction defense**: Preferentists will argue phenomenal value realism over-complicates metaethics. The article's response (preferences are thin proxies) is the Map's settled position.

- **Buddhist emptiness tension**: The tension between phenomenal value realism's identity claim and Buddhist dependent origination is acknowledged but not fully resolved. The Map's response (value is experienced as intrinsic whether or not ultimately empty) is a considered position.

- **"Analytic hedonism" label**: The article applies this label to Rawlette's position. While reasonable, she may not use this exact term. This is a terminological choice, not a factual error. Future reviews should not flag this as critical unless evidence surfaces that the label is misleading.

These disagreements are expected and do not indicate article deficiencies. Future reviews should not re-flag them as critical issues.
