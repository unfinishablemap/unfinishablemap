**Date**: 2026-02-17
**Article**: [[elisabeths-contemporaries-and-the-interaction-debate|Elisabeth's Contemporaries and the Interaction Debate]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Missing Leibniz / pre-established harmony**: The article listed "at least five distinct strategies" for responding to the interaction problem but omitted Leibniz's pre-established harmony — historically one of the most important responses. **Resolution**: Added a new section on Leibniz with citations (*Monadology* 1714, *New System of Nature* 1695), expanded the taxonomy to six strategies, and updated the Relation to Site Perspective to address Leibniz alongside occasionalists.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Awkward phrasing**: "Paralysed persons will movement that does not follow" was unclear. **Resolution**: Reworded to "Paralysed persons will bodily movement that never occurs."
- **Missing cross-links**: Body text lacked links to `[[causal-closure]]`, `[[mental-causation]]`, and `[[dualism]]` despite discussing these concepts directly. **Resolution**: Added inline wikilinks where contextually appropriate.
- **Unqualified claim about physics**: "Quantum mechanics reveals a domain where physics is genuinely incomplete" stated without noting this depends on interpretation. **Resolution**: Added qualifier "on the standard (non-Many-Worlds) interpretation."

### Low Issues Found
- `epiphenomenalism` in frontmatter concepts is never mentioned in body text. **Deferred** — the concept is legitimately related to the interaction problem even without inline mention.

### Counterarguments Considered
- Eliminative materialist: Modern neuroscience strengthens the monist position. **Not addressed** — the article appropriately presents monism as a live challenge without attempting to refute it in a historical survey.
- Quantum skeptic: Decoherence timescales not mentioned. **Not addressed** — this article is about 17th-century history; quantum details belong in dedicated articles.
- MWI defender: The No Many Worlds tenet not explicitly connected. **Partially addressed** — the interpretive qualifier now gestures at this without disrupting the historical focus.

### Attribution Accuracy Check
All eleven factual claims verified via web search against SEP, Cambridge Descartes Lexicon, and PhilPapers:
- All dates, publication titles, and biographical details confirmed accurate
- Spinoza *Ethics* II Proposition 7 quote confirmed verbatim
- Gassendi "thin vapour" paraphrase confirmed as faithful to Fifth Objections
- Arnauld's Fourth Objections role and triangle analogy confirmed
- La Forge's partial occasionalism confirmed
- Cordemoy's atomism confirmed
- More's "essential spissitude" coinage confirmed
- Conway's targets (Descartes, Hobbes, Spinoza, More) confirmed
- No misattributions, dropped qualifiers, or source/Map conflation found

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent opening paragraph that front-loads the historical narrative and Map connection
- Clear five-strategy taxonomy (now six) serves as the analytical core
- Fair treatment of monist positions — Conway, Cavendish, and Spinoza given philosophical due
- Clean separation between historical exposition and Map commentary
- The closing reversal in the Relation section — turning monism's dissolution back on itself via the hard problem — is effective argumentation
- William Hasker lineage from More's extended spirit is a genuine insight

### Enhancements Made
- Added Leibniz section with pre-established harmony as sixth strategy
- Added cross-links to `[[causal-closure]]`, `[[mental-causation]]`, `[[dualism]]`
- Added `occasionalism` to frontmatter concepts
- Qualified the "physics is genuinely incomplete" claim
- Fixed awkward Cordemoy phrasing
- Added Leibniz references

### Cross-links Added
- [[causal-closure]] (in Relation to Site Perspective)
- [[mental-causation]] (in Leibniz section)
- [[dualism]] (in Leibniz section)

## Remaining Items

- The article could benefit from a brief note connecting La Forge's partial occasionalism to contemporary agent causation theories — deferred as expansion opportunity, not a deficiency.
- A dedicated `obsidian/concepts/occasionalism.md` article would be valuable — noted as potential future task.

## Stability Notes

- The six adversarial personas will always find the Map's quantum interaction proposal speculative. This is an expected philosophical standoff, not a flaw in the article.
- The monist challenge (Spinoza, Conway, Cavendish) is presented fairly and acknowledged as "a live challenge" — future reviews should not demand stronger refutation in what is primarily a historical survey.
- Quantum mechanism details (decoherence timescales, etc.) belong in dedicated articles, not this historical piece.
