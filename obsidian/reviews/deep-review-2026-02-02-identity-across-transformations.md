**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Article**: [[identity-across-transformations|Identity Across Transformations]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Context

This review was triggered because the article had no inbound links and was orphaned. The primary focus was on finding related articles that should link to this content and adding cross-references to integrate it into the site navigation.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article is philosophically coherent without factual errors, broken links, or internal contradictions.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Unsupported claim about PNAS study**: The article originally cited "A 2025 PNAS study" about corpus callosum fibers without a full reference. Resolution: Softened to "Research on partial callosotomy patients suggests" to avoid unsupported specific claim.

### Low Issues Found
- Standard philosophical disagreements from adversarial perspectives (eliminative materialists, physicalists, MWI defenders)—these are expected for dualist content
- Missing `description` field in frontmatter: Added

### Counterarguments Considered
- **MWI self-locating uncertainty**: The article's treatment of many-worlds was strengthened to address the self-locating uncertainty framework more directly. Added a paragraph explaining why self-locating uncertainty seems inapplicable when all outcomes occur to equally real continuers.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening summary effectively states the thesis and survives truncation
- The Pattern Problem section elegantly dispatches standard alternatives (psychological, biological, narrative continuity)
- All six transformation case studies (pattern problem → phenomenological evidence → split-brain → anesthesia → altered states → quantum measurement → death) form a coherent progression
- Tenet connections are substantive and specific to all five tenets
- Appropriate epistemic humility ("possibilities, not claims")

### Enhancements Made
- Added `description` field: "What persists through radical change? The Map argues identity is irreducibly indexical—being *this* consciousness matters in ways pattern-based accounts cannot capture."
- Added `last_deep_review` timestamp
- Added `free-will` topic and `filter-theory` concept to frontmatter
- Strengthened MWI response regarding self-locating uncertainty
- Softened unsupported PNAS claim about corpus callosum research

### Cross-links Added (Primary Focus)
Inbound links to this apex article were added from:
- [[personal-identity]] — Further Reading section
- [[death-and-consciousness]] — Further Reading section
- [[split-brain-consciousness]] — Further Reading section
- [[loss-of-consciousness]] — Further Reading section
- [[haecceity]] — Further Reading section
- [[filter-theory]] — Further Reading section
- [[indexical-identity-quantum-measurement]] — Further Reading section

These seven cross-references integrate the orphaned apex article into the site navigation, connecting it to its source materials and related concepts.

## Word Count
- Before: 2455 words
- After: 2510 words (+55 words)
- Status: 63% of 4000 soft threshold (OK)

## Remaining Items

None. The article is well-structured and thoroughly integrated.

## Stability Notes

The adversarial personas (especially MWI defenders and eliminative materialists) will always find haecceitistic identity claims unsatisfying—this is a bedrock philosophical disagreement, not a fixable flaw. Future reviews should not re-flag "MWI response could be stronger" or "functionalist challenges not fully addressed" as critical issues.
