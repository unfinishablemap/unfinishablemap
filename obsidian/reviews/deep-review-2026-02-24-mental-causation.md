**Date**: 2026-02-24
**Article**: [[mental-causation|Mental Causation]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-02-mental-causation|2026-02-02]]
**Word count**: 3111 → 3096 (-15, length-neutral)
**Context**: Cross-review considering bandwidth-problem insights

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Stale link `[[psychophysical-coupling]]`**: The link on line 133 ("The [[psychophysical-coupling]] article surveys five candidate mechanisms") and in Further Reading pointed to an archived article. The content was coalesced into `psychophysical-laws.md`. [RESOLVED: Updated both references to `[[psychophysical-laws]]`]

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing bandwidth problem connection**: The Specification Challenge section discussed "which maps to which" but didn't mention the distinct "can the channel carry enough information" challenge from the new bandwidth-problem-mental-causation article. [RESOLVED: Added two sentences noting the bandwidth problem and hierarchical selection response]
- **Missing cross-links**: No links to bandwidth-problem-mental-causation or neural-bandwidth-constraints-and-the-interface. [RESOLVED: Added both to concepts frontmatter and Further Reading]

### Counterarguments Considered
All six adversarial personas engaged:
- Eliminative materialist: Illusionism section adequate; no new concerns
- Hard-nosed physicalist: Delegatory dualism integration stable from previous review
- Quantum skeptic: Decoherence section addresses Tegmark (2000) appropriately
- MWI defender: Philosophical standoff remains (bedrock disagreement per stability notes)
- Empiricist: Bandwidth constraint now referenced as additional empirical grounding
- Buddhist philosopher: No specific concerns

### Attribution Accuracy Check
- Kim's exclusion argument: Four premises correctly formulated ✓
- Saad's delegatory dualism: "Default causal profile" qualifier preserved ✓
- Stapp: Quantum Zeno/attention mechanism correctly attributed ✓
- Eccles: Vesicle release proposal correctly attributed ✓
- Lowe: Substance causation correctly characterized ✓
- Whitehead: Actual occasions and self-determination correctly attributed ✓
- Tallis: "Misrepresentation presupposes presentation" properly cited ✓
- Yablo: Proportional cause correctly attributed ✓
- Chalmers: Supervenience laws distinction correctly separated from Map's "selection laws" label ✓
- No misattributions detected

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Self-stultification argument: Clear, epistemically powerful
- Kim's exclusion argument: Fair and comprehensive four-premise formulation
- Quantum opening explanation: Accessible without oversimplifying
- Delegatory dualism section: Properly preserves Saad's qualifiers
- Agent causation section: Good phenomenological grounding
- Falsifiability conditions: Specific and credible
- Process philosophy section: Complements agent causation well

### Enhancements Made
- Added bandwidth problem mention in Specification Challenge section with cross-links
- Fixed stale `[[psychophysical-coupling]]` → `[[psychophysical-laws]]` link
- Added `[[bandwidth-problem-mental-causation]]` and `[[neural-bandwidth-constraints-and-the-interface]]` to concepts frontmatter and Further Reading
- Tightened overdetermination section (removed redundant phrasing)
- Tightened supervenience section (consolidated paragraphs)
- Tightened coupling-modes closing paragraph (removed parenthetical expansions)
- Removed niche Further Reading entry (epistemology-of-mechanism) and subsection link (substance causation, covered by agent-causation entry)

### Cross-links Added
- [[bandwidth-problem-mental-causation]] (Specification Challenge section, Further Reading, frontmatter)
- [[neural-bandwidth-constraints-and-the-interface]] (Specification Challenge section, Further Reading, frontmatter)

## Remaining Items

None. The article now integrates bandwidth-problem insights while maintaining length neutrality.

## Stability Notes

This is the fifth deep review. The article remains stable:

- **The MWI objection** remains a philosophical standoff—Many-Worlds defenders will find the indexical argument unsatisfying. Bedrock disagreement, not a flaw.

- **The decoherence objection** is acknowledged as genuinely challenging while noting it doesn't solve the measurement problem.

- **The illusionist challenge** is engaged adequately. The regress problem remains the standard response.

- **The specification problem** is properly connected to the psychophysical-laws framework and now includes the bandwidth problem as a distinct sub-challenge.

- **The bandwidth problem** is now referenced as a separate challenge from causal exclusion, noting the hierarchical selection response. The three-dimensional nature (capacity, grain, format) is linked via the bandwidth-problem-mental-causation concept page.

- **Stale link fixed**: The `[[psychophysical-coupling]]` archive link has been updated to `[[psychophysical-laws]]` throughout.

- **Further Reading adjusted**: Removed subsection link (substance causation) and niche entry (epistemology-of-mechanism) to accommodate bandwidth entries. Both removed items are linked from body text or other frontmatter entries.

The article is at 124% of soft threshold. No further expansion warranted; future reviews should focus on accuracy and connection maintenance. The article has reached maturity—no further deep reviews needed unless substantively modified.
