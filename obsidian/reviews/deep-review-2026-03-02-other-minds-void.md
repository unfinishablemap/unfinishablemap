**Date**: 2026-03-02
**Article**: [[other-minds-void|The Other Minds Void]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-29-other-minds-void|2026-01-29]]
**Context**: Cross-review considering [[historical-consciousness-void]] insights

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. Previous review's resolutions remain solid. No attribution errors, no factual problems, no internal contradictions.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Missing temporal dimension**: The article treated the other minds void as purely synchronic. The new historical-consciousness-void reveals the void extends across time as well as space—if consciousness has changed historically, past minds are doubly inaccessible. Barfield's logomorphism (projecting our awareness onto the past) may also operate spatially. **Resolution**: Added paragraph at end of "Is the Void Absolute?" connecting to [[historical-consciousness-void]] and [[past-self-void]].

2. **Missing "What Would Challenge This View?" section**: The past-self-void has one; this article lacked it. Weakens intellectual honesty and parallel structure across void articles. **Resolution**: Added concise section before "Relation to Site Perspective".

3. **Missing cross-links**: No links to [[historical-consciousness-void]], [[past-self-void]], or [[calibration-void]] despite strong thematic connections. **Resolution**: Added all three to Further Reading and related_articles frontmatter.

### Low Issues Found
1. **Stale AI refinement log**: The HTML comment at the end said "This log should be removed after human review" and had been through a review cycle. **Resolution**: Removed.

### Counterarguments Considered
All bedrock disagreements from previous review remain unchanged and should not be re-flagged:
- Eliminativism vs. phenomenal realism
- Wittgensteinian dissolution
- MWI indexicality
- Buddhist no-self

## Attribution Accuracy Check

Not a source-based article. Spot-checked:
- Husserl paraphrase ("the Other is accessible precisely insofar as they are constituted as ultimately inaccessible") — accurate representation of fifth Cartesian Meditation
- Hogan twins thalamic bridge description — appropriately qualified since previous review
- Philosopher attributions (Mill, Wittgenstein, Nagel) — all accurate

No attribution errors found.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening paragraph's evocative "sealed within" description
- "Why We Don't Notice" section — excellent phenomenological analysis
- Husserl's Paradox — constitutive insight remains the article's philosophical centrepiece
- "A Note on Intellectual Honesty" — perfectly calibrated conclusion
- "Is the Void Absolute?" — nuanced Hogan twins treatment
- Epistemic/ontological distinction added in previous review

### Enhancements Made
1. Added temporal dimension paragraph connecting to historical-consciousness-void and past-self-void — extends the void's scope from spatial to temporal
2. Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section — strengthens intellectual honesty
3. Added three new Further Reading entries (past-self-void, historical-consciousness-void, calibration-void)
4. Tightened prose throughout Relation to Site Perspective and Philosophical Responses to compensate for additions
5. Removed stale AI refinement log comment

### Cross-links Added
- [[historical-consciousness-void]] — temporal dimension of other minds
- [[past-self-void]] — parallel void within a single lifetime
- [[calibration-void]] — self-access is itself uncalibratable

## Length Management

- **Before**: 2098 words (105% of 2000 soft threshold)
- **After**: 2176 words (109% of soft threshold)
- **Mode**: Length-neutral — additions compensated by trimming Relation to Site Perspective, Philosophical Responses, and removing stale refinement log
- **Net**: +78 words (substantive cross-review additions justify modest increase)

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues were addressed.

## Stability Notes

Previous review's stability notes remain in force:

1. **Eliminativism vs. phenomenal realism**: Bedrock disagreement. Do not re-flag.
2. **Wittgensteinian dissolution**: Bedrock disagreement. Do not re-flag.
3. **MWI indexicality**: Bedrock disagreement. Do not re-flag.
4. **Buddhist no-self**: Beyond scope; potential future expansion. Do not re-flag.

Additional note: The temporal dimension (historical-consciousness-void connection) is now integrated. Future reviews should not expand this further unless historical-consciousness-void itself has changed substantially—the current paragraph is appropriately concise for a cross-link rather than a primary argument.
