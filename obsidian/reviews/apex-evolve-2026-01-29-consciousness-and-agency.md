# Apex Evolve Review: Consciousness and Agency

**Date**: 2026-01-29
**Article**: consciousness-and-agency
**Previous synthesis**: 2026-01-27T12:00:00+00:00

## Changed Sources Identified

1 source article modified since last synthesis:

| Source | Modified | Days Stale |
|--------|----------|------------|
| topics/free-will | 2026-01-29 | 2 |

### Key Updates in free-will.md

- New reference to **Sjöberg (2024)** study: patients with surgical resection of supplementary motor area retain voluntary action sense, challenging RP as volition indicator
- New section on **Phenomenology of Choice**: direct experiential evidence for selection vs observation
- New section on **Counterfactual Reasoning**: connecting to Bischof-Köhler hypothesis and baseline cognition
- **Motor Selection section** with Desmurget's neurosurgical studies showing intention/execution separation
- New cross-references: phenomenology-of-choice, counterfactual-reasoning, presentiment-and-retrocausality, consciousness-and-creativity
- **Distal Intentions section** on prospective memory

## Pessimistic Review Findings

### Clarity Critic
- Dense philosophical passages may lose general readers (e.g., atemporal quantum selection discussion)
- The phrase "phenomenally unified, temporally constitutive, reasons-responsive selection among quantum possibilities" packs too many concepts into one clause
- "Escaping the Luck Objection" section could be clearer about what "selection" means vs "reception"

### Redundancy Hunter
- Circle of mutually supporting elements described twice: end of "What the Pieces Show Together" and start of "Synthesis" — significant overlap
- "consciousness selects among quantum possibilities" appears in multiple variations throughout
- Phenomenology of effort discussion appears in multiple places

### Narrative Flow Analyst
- Transition from "Time, Collapse, and Selection" to "Moral Responsibility Grounded" was abrupt
- Article lacked integration of counterfactual reasoning (key addition to source)
- Phenomenology of choice not given weight it now receives in source
- Motor selection and Desmurget studies not integrated

## Optimistic Review Findings

### Connection Finder
New connections to weave in:
1. Sjöberg (2024) surgical resection study — stronger Libet counter-evidence
2. Counterfactual reasoning — links to Bischof-Köhler and baseline cognition
3. Phenomenology of choice — direct experiential evidence
4. Motor selection — second domain with identical architecture
5. Desmurget studies — intention/execution separation supports selection mechanism

### Synthesis Strengthener
- "Capacity to refrain" section could connect more explicitly to witness mode
- Counterfactual reasoning deserves synthesis treatment
- Desmurget studies directly support selection mechanism

### Human Reader Advocate
- Article could benefit from concrete example of selection in action
- Libet discussion more engaging with Sjöberg evidence
- "What this means for lived experience" passage could come earlier

## Length Assessment

- **Before**: 3066 words
- **After**: 3346 words
- **Target**: 2500-4000 words
- **Status**: Within range

Word count increased by ~280 words due to new material, but stayed within target range through consolidation of redundant sections.

## Summary of Changes Made

### Integrated from Updated Source
1. Added Sjöberg (2024) evidence to Libet discussion — surgical resection patients retain voluntary action
2. Added new "Counterfactual Reasoning and Deliberation" section connecting to Bischof-Köhler hypothesis
3. Integrated phenomenology-of-choice reference into the "phenomenology of effort" discussion
4. Added Desmurget's neurosurgical studies to neural signatures section
5. Added new source references (phenomenology-of-choice, counterfactual-reasoning) to frontmatter and source list

### Addressed Redundancy
- Consolidated "What the Pieces Show Together" and "Synthesis" sections into single unified "Synthesis" section
- Removed duplicate description of mutual-support structure

### Improved Narrative Flow
- Added transitional sentence before "Moral Responsibility Grounded" section
- Enhanced opening of Authorship Problem section to preview deliberation requirement
- Integrated counterfactual reasoning into synthesis paragraph

### Updated Frontmatter
