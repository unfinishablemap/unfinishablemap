## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
1. **Missing illusionist engagement**: No engagement with Frankish's quasi-phenomenal properties or how illusionism would explain the two-modes phenomenology.
   - **Resolution**: Added new "The Illusionist Challenge" section (~400 words) with regress argument, contemplative refinement response, and zombie reformulation.

2. **Thin Buddhist phenomenology**: Only brief Krishnamurti mention; no engagement with Buddhist meditation taxonomy, jhāna progression, or Abhidharma terminology.
   - **Resolution**: Added "Buddhist Phenomenology of the Two Modes" subsection (~350 words) covering śamatha/vipassanā distinction, Theravāda jhāna progression with Pāli terminology, Tibetan nine stages, and Zen shikantaza.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **No Many Worlds argument underdeveloped**: Single paragraph asserting "both modes presuppose collapse."
   - **Resolution**: Expanded to four paragraphs (~200 words) explaining why MWI makes the phenomenology of witness mode misleading and how the capacity to suspend selection implies real collapse.

2. **Process Philosophy missing**: No Whitehead perspective despite relevance to experiential processes.
   - **Resolution**: Added new "Process Philosophy Perspective" section (~300 words) connecting physical/mental poles to witness/selection modes, explaining concrescence phases, and linking to phenomenology-of-choice.

3. **Missing cross-links**: Should link to illusionism.md, phenomenology-of-choice.md, phenomenology.md.
   - **Resolution**: Added illusionism, phenomenology-of-choice, and phenomenology to concepts frontmatter and Further Reading section.

### Counterarguments Considered
- Eliminative materialist: Neural signatures have materialist explanations
- Dennett: "Effort does real work" conflates subjective experience with causal efficacy
- Tegmark: "Reduced observation rate" hypothesis lacks scientific grounding
- Buddhist: Treatment of Buddhist perspectives is thin

All addressed through additions described above.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear two-mode framework with phenomenology/mechanism/neural signature structure
- Well-integrated neuroscience evidence (Brewer, Hasenkamp, Wong studies)
- Effective resolution of Advaita paradox ("mode, not essence")
- Strong practical implications section
- Comprehensive original tenet coverage

### Enhancements Made
1. Illusionist challenge section with quasi-phenomenal engagement (~400 words)
2. Buddhist phenomenology expansion with Abhidharma, jhāna, śamatha terminology (~350 words)
3. Process Philosophy section with Whitehead's concrescence and poles (~300 words)
4. Expanded No Many Worlds argument (~200 words)
5. Cross-links to illusionism, phenomenology-of-choice, phenomenology

### Cross-links Added
- [[illusionism]] (concepts frontmatter and Further Reading)
- [[phenomenology-of-choice]] (concepts frontmatter and Further Reading)
- [[phenomenology]] (concepts frontmatter and Further Reading)
