**Date**: 2026-01-20
**Article**: [[topics/free-will|Free Will and Determinism]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-15-free-will|2026-01-15]]

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None - the article was already well-argued

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Decoherence section was thin**: Expanded with four specific response strategies (Tegmark calculation dispute, biological quantum effects, decoherence vs measurement problem, Zeno mechanism requirements)
2. **Illusionist challenge was brief**: Expanded with detailed engagement of Frankish's illusionism and Dennett's heterophenomenology, plus four specific site responses
3. **Missing process philosophy perspective**: Added new section connecting Whitehead's actual occasions to the selection framework
4. **No dedicated "Relation to Site Perspective" section**: Added comprehensive section connecting free will to all five tenets

### Counterarguments Considered
- Frankish's illusionism: Addressed through self-stultification, introspective trust, evolutionary burden, and aboutness problem arguments
- Dennett's heterophenomenology: Addressed by distinguishing representation from reality
- Tegmark decoherence objection: Expanded with multiple lines of empirical and theoretical response

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent integration of quantum mechanics with libertarian free will
- Strong treatment of the luck objection with systematic site response
- Comprehensive coverage of neural signatures (willed vs instructed attention)
- Good integration with meditation research and witness mode
- Sophisticated treatment of agent causation vs event causation
- Creative generation section strengthening agent-causal picture

### Enhancements Made
1. Added process philosophy section (Whitehead's actual occasions)
2. Expanded decoherence response with Hagan et al. critique of Tegmark
3. Expanded illusionist engagement with four specific response strategies
4. Added "Relation to Site Perspective" section connecting to all five tenets
5. Added cross-links to introspection, haecceity, decoherence
6. Added new references (Tegmark, Hagan et al., Whitehead, Frankish)

### Cross-links Added
- [[decoherence]] - for quantum decoherence objection
- [[introspection]] - for introspective trust argument against illusionism
- [[haecceity]] - for indexical identity in personal identity section
- [[illusionism]] - prominent linking in expanded section
- [[concepts/epiphenomenalism]] - added to frontmatter concepts

## Remaining Items

None - all identified issues were addressed.

## Summary

The free-will.md article was already comprehensive but benefited from:
1. Deeper engagement with the decoherence objection (philosophical and empirical responses)
2. More substantive treatment of illusionism as the strongest eliminativist challenge
3. Addition of process philosophy perspective providing metaphysical context
4. Explicit connection to all five tenets in dedicated section
5. Enhanced cross-linking to related site content

The article now stands at ~530 lines with improved argumentation on the key challenges to libertarian free will.
