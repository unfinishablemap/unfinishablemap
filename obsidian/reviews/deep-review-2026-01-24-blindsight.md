# Deep Review: Blindsight

**Date**: 2026-01-24
**File**: obsidian/concepts/blindsight.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Missing citation for accuracy figures**: The claim "70-90% accuracy" lacked citation.
   - **Resolution**: Added specific citation to Weiskrantz et al. (1974) and Weiskrantz (1986) with context that D.B. achieved 80-90% on location discrimination.

2. **Misleading Maniscalco & Lau citation**: The 2012 paper is about signal detection methodology, not blindsight phenomenology interpretation.
   - **Resolution**: Replaced with more appropriate citations (Lau & Passingham 2006, Persaud et al. 2011) and reframed the paragraph to correctly attribute the metacognitive failure interpretation.

3. **Type 2 blindsight claims unsourced**: Reference to Type 2 patients reporting "vague feelings" lacked citation.
   - **Resolution**: Added citation to Weiskrantz (1998) which distinguishes Type 1 and Type 2 blindsight.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **No engagement with Block's access/phenomenal distinction**: Despite blindsight being Block's paradigm case, the article didn't connect to the site's comprehensive access-consciousness article.
   - **Resolution**: Added new "Block's Access/Phenomenal Distinction" section (~250 words) explaining how blindsight figures in Block's framework.

2. **Illusionist challenge not addressed**: Missing engagement with illusionist interpretation.
   - **Resolution**: Added new "The Illusionist Challenge" section (~250 words) presenting and responding to the illusionist view.

3. **Weak quantum mechanism connection**: The quantum selection claim was speculative but presented without sufficient hedging.
   - **Resolution**: Added "This remains highly speculative—there is no direct evidence that quantum effects play a role in the blindsight dissociation" and reframed as illustration of framework.

4. **No Many Worlds tenet connection**: The quantum selection claim has MWI implications not addressed.
   - **Resolution**: Added paragraph connecting to No Many Worlds tenet.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Eliminative materialist objection**: That the access/phenomenal distinction may be folk-psychological rather than tracking real kinds. Addressed by presenting the empirical dissociation as evidence for the distinction.

- **Dennett's "Multiple Drafts" response**: That patient reports of "seeing nothing" may be unreliable. Addressed in the metacognitive failure interpretation section.

- **Quantum skeptic objection**: That quantum mechanisms are speculative. Addressed with explicit hedging in the revised text.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Clear opening summary that survives truncation
- Fair presentation of three competing interpretations
- Strong baseline cognition connection with specific examples of what's preserved vs. lost
- Nuanced treatment of dualist implications that acknowledges physicalist responses

### Enhancements Made

1. **Block's access/phenomenal framework**: New section connecting to the site's existing comprehensive treatment
2. **Illusionist engagement**: New section presenting and responding to illusionism
3. **Attention mechanism connection**: Added link to voluntary attention and the role of V1 in top-down selection
4. **Citation improvements**: Added de Gelder et al. (1999) for emotional processing, Lau & Passingham (2006) for metacognitive approach, Weiskrantz (1998) for Type 2 distinction, Block (1995) for access/phenomenal framework
