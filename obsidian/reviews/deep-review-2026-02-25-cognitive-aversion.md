**Date**: 2026-02-25
**Article**: [[cognitive-aversion|Cognitive Aversion]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-03-cognitive-aversion|2026-02-03]]
**Word count**: 1969 → 2032 (+63 words, 102% of 2000 soft threshold)
**Mode**: Length-neutral (at threshold; cross-review additions justified minor overshoot)

## Context

Cross-review triggered by creation of [[appetitive-void|The Appetitive Void]] (2026-02-25). The appetitive void article explicitly references cognitive-aversion and distinguishes itself from it, but the reverse link was missing. Primary goal: integrate appetitive-void insights into cognitive-aversion.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article remains well-structured with appropriate claims and empirical grounding. No critical issues from previous review have resurfaced.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing cross-link to appetitive-void**: The appetitive void article references cognitive-aversion, but the reverse link was absent. **Resolution**: Added appetitive-void to related_articles, added two body references (in "Aversion Versus Closure" section and "Contemplative Practice" subsection), and added to Further Reading.
- **Cosmicism citation gap**: Lines 73-74 claimed "Research suggests cosmicism triggers 'higher rates of existential anxiety than any other subgenre'" but reference #7 (Lovecraft) is a primary source, not the research paper. **Resolution**: Reframed as "Cosmicism appears to trigger particular existential anxiety" without the unsupported comparative claim.
- **Missing cross-links**: topology-of-cognitive-failure and limits-reveal-structure were natural connections not yet made. **Resolution**: Added to related_articles and Further Reading.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative Materialist**: Cognitive aversion is just emotional regulation. Article already addresses via falsification conditions and the closure/aversion distinction. Not critical.
- **Empiricist**: Cosmicism anxiety claim needed better support. Addressed by reframing.
- **Buddhist perspective**: Desire to overcome aversion is itself appetitively structured. Addressed by adding appetitive void connection in contemplative practice section.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- **Phenomenological taxonomy** (slide, substitution, glaze, discomfort, rationalization) — distinctive and well-crafted
- **Closure/aversion distinction table** — clear comparative framework
- **Bridge hypothesis** — "aversion might be the first phenomenological manifestation of approaching the architecturally closed"
- **AI-as-probe methodology** in "What AI Might See" section
- **Falsification conditions** — appropriately specific and honest

### Enhancements Made
- Added appetitive void connection in "Aversion Versus Closure" section: cognitive aversion as local manifestation of pervasive appetitive structuring
- Added appetitive void paradox in contemplative practice: desire to overcome aversion is itself desire
- Tightened cosmicism section (removed unsupported comparative claim)
- Tightened Becker section (removed redundant final sentence)
- Tightened "Destabilizing Self-Knowledge" section (consolidated parallel constructions)

### Cross-links Added
- [[appetitive-void]] (related_articles, body text ×2, Further Reading)
- [[topology-of-cognitive-failure]] (related_articles, Further Reading)
- [[limits-reveal-structure]] (related_articles, Further Reading)

## Remaining Items

None. The cross-review integration is complete.

## Stability Notes

This is the second review. The article has reached good stability:
- Core structure and arguments unchanged from first review
- Phenomenological taxonomy, bridge hypothesis, and falsification conditions all preserved
- Changes were driven by cross-review context (new appetitive-void article) rather than quality issues
- The cosmicism citation reframing was a minor accuracy improvement
- Materialist persona disagreements remain expected philosophical standoffs, not critical issues
- The appetitive void connection enriches the article without disrupting its existing argument structure
- Future reviews should not re-flag the cosmicism section or expand it beyond current scope
