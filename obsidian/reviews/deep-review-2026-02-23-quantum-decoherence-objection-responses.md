**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

- **Broken wikilink to archived article**: `[[measurement-problem-as-hard-problem]]` pointed to an archived article. Replaced with `[[the-measurement-problem-as-philosophical-problem]]` and added cross-links to `[[explanatory-gap]]` in the same passage.
- **"Seven orders of magnitude" arithmetic error**: Tegmark's headline figure (10⁻¹³) compared to Hameroff's corrected range (10⁻⁵ to 10⁻⁴) yields 8-9 orders, not 7. Corrected to "eight or more orders of magnitude" and clarified Tegmark's range (headline vs. larger separations).
- **Claim 3 stated as "false" without qualification**: Added "under any interpretation that takes the measurement problem seriously" — acknowledging that under MWI or Bohmian mechanics, the claim has different status.
- **Response 1 labeled "Decisive" without interpretation-dependence**: Changed to "Decisive under collapse interpretations" and added closing qualifier.
- **"No single response is decisive" vs "Strength: Decisive" tension**: Changed opening to "No single response settles the matter on every front" to resolve the terminological contradiction.
- **Incomplete SEP quote**: Added missing "to the theory" at the end of the Stanford Encyclopedia quotation.

### Medium Issues Found

- **Response 3 presented only Stapp's model**: Broadened to note that radical pair effects, ion channel tunnelling, and synaptic vesicle release all involve discrete quantum events, making the response applicable to the entire class of discrete-event mechanisms, not just Stapp's Zeno model. Added link to `[[quantum-neural-mechanisms-and-coherence]]`.
- **No engagement with "mere randomness" counterargument**: Added paragraph in Response 1 addressing the physicalist objection that outcomes are "simply stochastic events" — this relabels the problem without solving it.
- **Missing cross-links**: Added `[[quantum-neural-mechanisms-and-coherence]]`, `[[the-measurement-problem-as-philosophical-problem]]`, `[[explanatory-gap]]`, and in-body link to `[[quantum-neural-timing-constraints]]`.
- **"Confirmed" overstated for Princeton study**: Changed to "provided computational support for" to match the study's actual scope.
- **Enzyme catalysis acceleration overstated**: Replaced specific numbers (10¹² to 10¹⁷) attributed entirely to tunnelling with accurate framing ("partly through quantum tunnelling, with large kinetic isotope effects confirming the mechanism").

### Counterarguments Considered

- **MWI dissolves the measurement problem**: Addressed by qualifying Response 1 as "decisive under collapse interpretations" and explicitly noting that treating decoherence as resolving the measurement problem implicitly adopts Many-Worlds, which the Map's No Many Worlds tenet rejects.
- **"Mere randomness" objection**: Added direct response — calling outcomes "random" describes statistics but doesn't explain individual actualisation.
- **Quantum biology doesn't generalize to neural tissue**: Already handled by the article's honest "establishes possibility, not actuality" framing. No change needed.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- The three-claim disaggregation structure — the article's central analytical contribution
- Calibrated strength labeling for each response ("Decisive," "Substantial but contested," etc.)
- The summary table mapping layers to sufficiency
- Front-loaded opening paragraph that survives truncation
- The burden-of-proof shift conclusion
- Honest acknowledgment of what the decoherence objection retains after all responses

### Enhancements Made

- Deepened Response 1 with decoherence/collapse conflation analysis (~150 words)
- Added "mere randomness" counterargument engagement in Response 1 (~70 words)
- Broadened Response 3 from Stapp-only to all discrete-event mechanisms (~80 words)
- Added premature closure pattern note to "What Survives" (~60 words)
- Connected Bidirectional Interaction tenet in Relation to Site Perspective (~60 words)

### Cross-links Added

- [[the-measurement-problem-as-philosophical-problem]]
- [[explanatory-gap]]
- [[quantum-neural-mechanisms-and-coherence]]
- [[quantum-neural-timing-constraints]] (in-body link, was only in Further Reading)

## Remaining Items

- **"Seventeen orders of magnitude" claim** (Response 5): Verified as correct (10⁻²⁰ to 10⁻³ = 17 orders). No change needed.
- **Table could include claim-target column**: Deferred as low priority — the information is already clear from the individual response sections.
- **Bandyopadhyay oscillation frequency**: Article says "megahertz" while decoherence.md says "kilohertz to terahertz." Both are technically accurate (megahertz is within that range), but the broader range could be noted. Deferred as very low priority.

## Stability Notes

- The MWI defender's objection to Response 1 is a bedrock philosophical disagreement, not a fixable flaw. The article now explicitly acknowledges the interpretation-dependence. Future reviews should not re-flag this as critical.
- The "burden of proof has shifted" conclusion is the article's assessment, not the field's consensus. This is appropriate for a site that takes positions. Future reviews should not flag this as an unsupported claim — it is an argued conclusion.
- The phenomenological case for discrete attention (suggested by optimistic review) was not added because the writing style guide counsels restraint on the quantum Zeno effect. The current treatment is appropriately measured.
