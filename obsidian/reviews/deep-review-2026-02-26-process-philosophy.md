**Date**: 2026-02-26
**Article**: [[process-philosophy|Process Philosophy]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-27-process-philosophy|2026-01-27]]

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
1. **Broken wikilink to archived article**: Line 98 referenced `[[eastern-philosophy-haecceity-tension|Eastern Philosophy–Haecceity Tension]]` but this article was archived on 2026-02-06 (coalesced into `eastern-philosophy-consciousness`). The content about process haecceitism and the flame analogy now lives in `[[process-haecceitism]]`.
   - **Resolution**: Updated link to `[[process-haecceitism|Process haecceitism]]` which is the dedicated concept article covering this material.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Missing Stapp reference**: Henry Stapp's work was discussed in the Quantum Connection section (added in previous review) but no citation was included in References.
   - **Resolution**: Added Stapp, H. (2007). *Mindful Universe: Quantum Mechanics and the Participating Observer*. Springer.

2. **Stale Further Reading section**: Several dedicated concept articles created since the last review (`process-haecceitism`, `prehension`, `subjective-aim`) and a dedicated apex synthesis (`process-and-consciousness`) were not cross-linked.
   - **Resolution**: Added five new entries to Further Reading: `process-and-consciousness` (apex), `process-haecceitism`, `prehension`, `subjective-aim`, `bergson-and-duration`.

3. **Incomplete frontmatter concepts**: The `concepts` field didn't reference newer dedicated articles that process-philosophy.md substantially discusses.
   - **Resolution**: Added `process-haecceitism`, `prehension`, `subjective-aim` to frontmatter concepts.

### Attribution Accuracy Check
- All Whitehead attributions verified: "vacuous actuality," "concrescence," "creativity" as "the ultimate category," "prehension" — all accurate to *Process and Reality*
- Bergson quote "Time is invention or it is nothing at all" — correctly attributed, from *Creative Evolution*
- William James "shut in their own skin" — accurately attributed, from *Principles of Psychology*
- Stapp's "Heisenberg choice" and "Dirac choice" terminology — accurate to his published work
- Source/Map separation well maintained throughout, especially in "Tensions with the Map's Framework"
- No misattributions, dropped qualifiers, or source/Map conflation found

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist**: "Both are modes of process" doesn't explain subjective experience — article fairly presents process philosophy's claims without overclaiming they solve the hard problem
- **Dennett's functionalism**: "Dissolution" of mind-matter gap is relabeling — article acknowledges combination problem as "process philosophy's central challenge"
- **Popper's empiricism**: Unfalsifiable framework — addressed in Testability section (from previous review), remains adequate
- **Many-worlds**: MWI section appropriately restrained — notes Whitehead "doesn't explicitly address quantum interpretations"
- **Nagarjuna**: Buddhist process thought could be engaged more deeply — deferred (the dedicated process-haecceitism article now covers this territory)

All counterarguments from the previous review's stability notes remain valid: materialist, empiricist, and MWI objections are bedrock philosophical disagreements, not fixable flaws.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- **Tensions section**: Honest about where process philosophy diverges from the Map — the Panpsychism vs. Interactionist Dualism subsection is particularly well-balanced
- **Combination problem discussion**: Balanced treatment acknowledging it "remains process philosophy's central challenge" while cataloging three process responses
- **Bergson integration**: Elegant parallel structure between Bergson and Whitehead with clear divergence point (temporal atomism)
- **Tenet-by-tenet Relation to Site Perspective**: Each of the five tenets gets specific treatment showing both alignment and tension
- **Testability section**: Honest epistemological self-awareness added in previous review
- **Stapp integration**: Provides the crucial quantum bridge without overclaiming

### Enhancements Made
1. **Fixed broken cross-link**: Updated archived `eastern-philosophy-haecceity-tension` reference to point to the dedicated `process-haecceitism` concept article
2. **Expanded cross-link network**: Added five new Further Reading entries connecting to articles created since the last review
3. **Added Stapp citation**: Completed the reference for the Stapp content added in the previous review
4. **Updated frontmatter concepts**: Added three newly-relevant concept articles to the metadata

### Cross-links Added
- [[process-and-consciousness]] (apex synthesis)
- [[process-haecceitism]] (dedicated concept, replaced broken link)
- [[prehension]] (dedicated concept)
- [[subjective-aim]] (dedicated concept)
- [[bergson-and-duration]] (topic)

## Remaining Items

None. All critical and medium issues addressed. The article is stable and well-connected.

## Word Count

Before: 2005 words
After: 2067 words (+62 words, 3% increase)
Status: 83% of soft threshold (2500 words for concepts/) — well within limits

## Stability Notes

This is the second deep review. The article has reached good stability:

- **No philosophical content changes needed**: The substance of the article—its treatment of Whitehead, Bergson, the combination problem, and the Map's tensions—was already solid from the first review. This review focused on maintenance (broken link, missing citations, cross-link updates).

- **Bedrock disagreements unchanged**: Materialist, empiricist, and MWI objections remain expected philosophical standoffs. The Testability section honestly acknowledges the empiricist concern. The combination problem section honestly acknowledges the internal challenge. Future reviews should not re-flag these.

- **Cross-link maintenance is the main ongoing need**: As the Map grows, new dedicated articles (like `process-haecceitism`, `prehension`, `subjective-aim`) need to be linked from parent articles. This is maintenance, not a content problem.

- The article should be considered stable unless substantive content changes are made. Routine cross-link updates as new articles are created remain appropriate.
