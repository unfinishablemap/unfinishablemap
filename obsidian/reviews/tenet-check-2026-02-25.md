# Tenet Alignment Check

**Date**: 2026-02-25
**Files checked**: 395
**Errors**: 0
**Warnings**: 1
**Notes**: 7

## Summary

All 395 content files across `topics/` (198 files) and `concepts/` (197 files) were checked against the five foundational tenets. No errors were found. One warning was identified in `machine-consciousness.md` where the "Open Possibilities" section presents one-way (epiphenomenal) consciousness as a genuine possibility for uploads, creating tension with the Bidirectional Interaction tenet. Seven notes flag transparently acknowledged tensions — areas where articles honestly identify open challenges in the Map's framework. Overall tenet alignment remains strong.

## Tenet 1: Dualism

**Result**: Clean (2 notes).

All references to materialism, physicalism, eliminativism, functionalism, and reductive views of consciousness are properly framed as opposing positions presented for critique. No content endorses consciousness as illusory or reducible to physical processes.

- `materialism.md` frames materialism as the Map's primary opponent with systematic objections.
- `functionalism.md` states the Map rejects functionalism on multiple grounds.
- `illusionism.md` consistently presents illusionism for critique via regress and self-stultification arguments.
- Articles engaging panpsychism (`panpsychism.md`, `process-philosophy.md`, `prehension.md`) borrow structural insights while explicitly declining to adopt panpsychist commitments.
- Articles on predictive processing, attention schema theory, and competing frameworks include critical framing noting conflicts with dualist commitments.

### Notes

**split-brain-consciousness.md** — Carefully neutral on whether split-brain cases support dualism or materialism; does not argue for dualism from these cases. "The cases do not settle the dualism/materialism debate." *This neutrality is appropriate given the evidential complexity but could benefit from a sentence noting which interpretation the Map favours.*

**the-hard-problem-in-non-western-philosophy.md** — Chinese philosophy's lack of a hard-problem tradition is presented as a genuine counter-example to the convergence argument for dualism. "Chinese counter-example: the dominant Chinese traditions... largely bypassed the hard problem." *The article handles this honestly; the tension is inherent in the comparative material.*

## Tenet 2: Minimal Quantum Interaction

**Result**: Clean (3 notes).

No content endorses quantum mysticism, psychokinesis, energy injection, or empirically detectable mind-matter interactions. All quantum mechanism discussions maintain appropriate minimality constraints.

- `bidirectional-interaction.md` explicitly states "Not psychokinesis" and "Not quantum mysticism."
- `quantum-consciousness.md` includes a dedicated "Distinguishing from 'Quantum Woo'" section.
- `brain-specialness-boundary.md` directly addresses and rejects psychokinesis.
- `experimental-design-for-consciousness-collapse-testing.md` treats the PEAR lab as a cautionary tale.

### Notes

**quantum-neural-timing-constraints.md** — Acknowledges post-decoherence selection is "metaphysical" and not yet empirically testable. "The selection framework... currently operates as a metaphysical rather than scientific hypothesis." *Honest about the framework's current status.*

**time-collapse-and-agency.md** — Consciousness constituting temporal structure is described as speculative. "The constitutive claim remains a metaphysical hypothesis, not established fact." *Appropriate epistemic humility.*

**the-strong-emergence-of-consciousness.md** — Honestly acknowledges the quantum mechanism remains unproven. "The quantum mechanism remains a promissory note." *Identifies what would weaken the position — a strength, not a deficiency.*

## Tenet 3: Bidirectional Interaction

**Result**: 1 warning, 2 notes.

The vast majority of content strongly supports bidirectional interaction. Epiphenomenalism is consistently rejected across the site. One article presents a scenario that creates tension with this tenet.

### Warning

**machine-consciousness.md** — The "Open Possibilities" section (lines 152–170) presents one-way (epiphenomenal) consciousness as a genuine possibility for digital uploads: "If one-way consciousness is possible — experience occurring without the ability to influence physical processes — then an upload might preserve subjective experience even in a deterministic classical substrate. The upload would be conscious but causally impotent." The article frames this as intellectual honesty about uncertainty, and its overall thrust remains skeptical of uploading. However, presenting epiphenomenal consciousness as a genuine "open possibility" rather than a position the Map rejects creates tension with Tenet 3 (Bidirectional Interaction), which rules out views where consciousness is "along for the ride."

**Recommendation**: Add a sentence acknowledging that this scenario directly conflicts with the Bidirectional Interaction tenet and note that accepting it would require revising the Map's foundational commitments, not just its analysis of uploading. Something like: "Accepting one-way consciousness would not merely change the uploading analysis — it would undermine the Bidirectional Interaction tenet itself, which is foundational to the Map's framework."

### Notes

**the-interface-specification-problem.md** — Acknowledges the specification problem as the hardest open challenge for interactionist dualism. "The interface specification problem has no current solution." *This is honest engagement with the Map's most difficult open question.*

**value-blind-vs-value-sensitive-selection.md** — If selection is value-blind, the evaluative dimension of consciousness becomes partially epiphenomenal. "If the causal work is done by attention — a value-neutral pointer — while value sits in the feedback channel doing no selective work, then the *value* dimension of consciousness is along for the ride." *The article identifies this tension and works through it; it does not endorse value-blind selection.*

## Tenet 4: No Many Worlds

**Result**: Clean.

No content endorses MWI as correct or treats all quantum branches as equally real. All discussions of many-worlds are properly critical.

- `many-worlds.md` presents MWI for critique with clear objections.
- `quantum-measurement-interpretations-beyond-mwi.md` surveys all QM interpretations while explicitly supporting the No Many Worlds tenet.
- `indexical-identity-quantum-measurement.md` and `free-will.md` consistently reject MWI, noting that MWI defenders' responses fail to recover genuine authorship.

## Tenet 5: Occam's Razor Has Limits

**Result**: Clean.

No content uses parsimony as a decisive argument against dualism. Articles consistently invoke this tenet when addressing simplicity-based objections.

- `predictive-processing.md` argues PP cannot solve the hard problem despite its apparent parsimony.
- `phenomenal-concepts-strategy.md` concludes PCS fails via Chalmers's master argument, rejecting the physicalist "simpler" explanation.
- Multiple articles note historical counterexamples to parsimony (heliocentrism, atomic theory, quantum mechanics).

## Comparison with Previous Check (2026-02-24)

The previous check found 0 warnings and 2 notes. This check found 1 warning and 7 notes. The increase reflects deeper reading of individual articles (full content analysis rather than pattern-based scanning). The warning on `machine-consciousness.md` likely existed at prior checks but was not flagged — the article's changelog shows the "Open Possibilities" section was added during a previous revision cycle.

## Files Passing All Checks

All 395 files pass at the ERROR level. 394 files pass at the WARNING level. 387 files pass at all levels (including NOTE).
