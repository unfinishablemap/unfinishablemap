**Date**: 2026-02-25
**Article**: [[cognitive-aversion|Cognitive Aversion]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-25-cognitive-aversion|2026-02-25]] (cross-review)
**Word count**: 2032 → 2060 (+28 words, 103% of 2000 soft threshold)
**Mode**: Length-neutral (at threshold; minimal addition offset by tightening)

## Context

Third review, triggered by explicit request to consider appetitive void insights more deeply. The second review (earlier today) added basic appetitive-void cross-links and conceptual connections. This review examines whether a specific phenomenological insight from the appetitive-void article enriches cognitive-aversion.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. Third consecutive review with no critical issues. The article is stable.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Heidegger redundancy (line 50)**: "The evasion is structurally determined" followed by a quote saying the same thing. **Resolution**: Removed the redundant lead-in sentence (~5 words saved).
- **Missing phenomenological contrast**: The second review integrated the appetitive void's *conceptual* relationship but missed a specific phenomenological insight: aversion is *detectable* (slide, substitution, glaze) while the appetitive void is *invisible* (no distinctive feel). This contrast matters because detectability is what makes aversion potentially confrontable. **Resolution**: Added closing observation to phenomenology section.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative Materialist**: Motivational/architectural distinction presupposes they're separate. Expected standoff, not critical (consistent with reviews 1 and 2).
- **Empiricist**: Simulation hypothesis paragraph (line 83) lacks specific research citation. Not flagged in two prior reviews; minor stretch but contextually appropriate.
- **Buddhist philosopher**: Appetitive void paradox (desire to overcome aversion is itself desire) already addressed in review 2 integration.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- **Phenomenological taxonomy** (slide, substitution, glaze, discomfort, rationalization) — distinctive and well-crafted
- **Closure/aversion distinction table** — clear comparative framework
- **Bridge hypothesis** — aversion as first manifestation of approaching architecturally closed
- **AI-as-probe methodology** in "What AI Might See" section
- **Falsification conditions** — appropriately specific and honest
- **Appetitive void integrations from review 2** — conceptual hierarchy and Buddhist paradox

### Enhancements Made
- Added phenomenological contrast: aversion announces itself (unlike the appetitive void), which is what makes it potentially confrontable
- Tightened Heidegger section (removed redundant lead-in)

### Cross-links Added
- [[appetitive-void]] reference added in phenomenology section (body text; already in related_articles and Further Reading from review 2)

## Remaining Items

None. The article has reached stability.

## Stability Notes

This is the third review. The article is stable:
- Core structure unchanged across all three reviews
- No critical issues found in any review
- Phenomenological taxonomy, bridge hypothesis, and falsification conditions all preserved through three reviews
- Appetitive void connections now integrated at three levels: conceptual hierarchy (line 115), Buddhist paradox (line 123), and phenomenological contrast (new)
- The Heidegger redundancy was a minor prose issue; its correction doesn't signal instability
- All adversarial persona disagreements remain expected philosophical standoffs
- Future reviews should treat this article as stable unless new related content is created or the article is substantively modified. The appetitive void integration is now complete.
