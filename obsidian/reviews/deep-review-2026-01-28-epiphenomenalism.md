**Date**: 2026-01-28
**Article**: [[concepts/epiphenomenalism|Epiphenomenalism]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-27-epiphenomenalism|2026-01-27]]
**Cross-review context**: contemplative evidence for consciousness theories

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The article has been reviewed multiple times in recent days and is in good shape. This cross-review focuses specifically on integration with the new `contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness-theories.md` article.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Missing cross-reference to new contemplative evidence article**: The new `contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness-theories.md` directly targets epiphenomenalism with contemplative evidence (willed vs instructed attention, therapeutic efficacy, witness consciousness). The epiphenomenalism article referenced `contemplative-neuroscience` but not this more comprehensive treatment.
   - **Resolution**: Added cross-reference to the new article in both the concepts frontmatter and Further Reading section. Updated the contemplative neuroscience body section to reference the new article and its therapeutic efficacy argument.

### Counterarguments Considered

All six adversarial personas were applied:

1. **Eliminative Materialist**: Brief dismissal remains appropriate given site tenets.
2. **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: Functionalist section remains adequate.
3. **Quantum Skeptic**: Quantum mechanisms appropriately presented as possibilities.
4. **Many-Worlds Defender**: Bedrock disagreement aligned with site tenets.
5. **Empiricist**: New contemplative evidence article strengthens the empirical case; cross-reference added.
6. **Buddhist Philosopher**: Witness consciousness evidence from new article now referenced indirectly.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Self-stultification argument remains the article's core
- Tracking puzzle articulation unchanged
- Access vs phenomenal consciousness distinction (from previous review)
- Agent causation integration
- Careful quantum mechanism framing

### Enhancements Made

1. Added `[[contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness-theories]]` to concepts frontmatter
2. Added new article to Further Reading with description emphasizing it as "the most direct empirical challenge to epiphenomenalism"
3. Rewrote contemplative neuroscience section to reference new article and add therapeutic efficacy argument
4. Condensed bullet-point neuroplastic changes to prose to save space

### Cross-links Added

- [[contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness-theories]] (in frontmatter, Further Reading, and body text)

## Length Management

- **Before**: 2562 words (102% of 2500 soft threshold)
- **After**: 2542 words (102% of 2500 soft threshold)
- **Change**: -20 words

Operated in length-neutral mode. Added new cross-references and therapeutic efficacy argument while condensing the neuroplastic changes from bullet points to prose and removing some redundant framing.

## Remaining Items

None. The targeted cross-review enhancement has been applied.

## Stability Notes

- **Article is stable**: This is the third deep review in three days. The article's core argument structure is sound. This cross-review made targeted enhancements to integrate the new contemplative evidence article.

- **No oscillation detected**: The changes complement previous reviews without reversing any prior decisions.

- **Bedrock disagreements unchanged**: MWI proponents, eliminativists, and deflationary physicalists will continue to disagree with the article's framework. These represent philosophical standoffs, not fixable flaws.

- **Convergence maintained**: The article continues to improve incrementally as new related content is created, without fundamental restructuring.
