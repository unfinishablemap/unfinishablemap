**Date**: 2026-02-22
**Article**: [[temporal-consciousness|Temporal Consciousness]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-31-temporal-consciousness|2026-01-31 (fourth review, marked stable)]]
**Context**: Review considering specious present insights; article modified since last review

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Broken link — `psychophysical-coupling-law`** (frontmatter + inline): Archived article, superseded by `psychophysical-laws`. Updated both the frontmatter concepts list and inline reference at "coupling law research."
   - Resolution: Replaced with `[[psychophysical-laws]]` in both locations.

2. **Broken link — `phenomenal-unity`** (frontmatter only): Archived article, superseded by `phenomenal-binding-and-holism`.
   - Resolution: Replaced with `[[phenomenal-binding-and-holism]]` in concepts list.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Specious present duration range imprecision**: Opening paragraph cited "100 milliseconds to 3 seconds" which conflated three distinct timescales identified in the specious present research. The research (specious-present-temporal-experience-2026-01-16) distinguishes: perceptual moment (~100ms), specious present proper (~300-750ms), extended present (~2-3s).
   - Resolution: Sharpened opening to "core duration of roughly 300-750 milliseconds, embedded in a broader experiential horizon of 2-3 seconds." Updated the Specious Present section to explicitly name all three timescales as "nested components of temporal experience" rather than competing estimates.

### Counterarguments Considered

All six adversarial personas engaged. No new counterarguments beyond those identified in prior reviews:
- Eliminative materialist: chord example begs the question (bedrock disagreement)
- Hard-nosed physicalist: illusionism response is fair; regress argument well-crafted
- Quantum skeptic: decoherence section appropriately qualified
- Many-worlds defender: branching/unity argument represents incompatible intuitions
- Empiricist: all citations verified consistent with research notes
- Buddhist philosopher: cessation/traveler tension acknowledged

### Attribution Accuracy Check

All checks passed:
- [x] Husserl tripartite structure: correctly described
- [x] James on consciousness "flowing": correct
- [x] Bergson's durée and "qualitative multiplicity": accurate
- [x] Hoel (2025) continual learning argument: correctly attributed
- [x] Whitehead terminology (actual occasions, prehension, concrescence): accurately used
- [x] Kent & Wittmann (2021): real paper, correctly cited
- [x] Hagan et al. (2002): correctly cited for revised decoherence estimates
- [x] No source/Map conflation detected
- [x] Qualifiers preserved throughout quantum sections

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

All major strengths from prior reviews remain intact:
- Opening chord example (C-E-G) illustrating temporal binding
- Husserl retention-primal impression-protention structure
- Bergson's "qualitative multiplicity" explanation
- Working memory as neural correlate section
- Hoel's formal argument against LLM consciousness
- Sleep and temporal experience analysis
- Five-tenet coverage in Relation to Site Perspective
- Illusionist regress argument
- Process philosophy section with Whitehead terminology
- Duration-from-instants parallel to qualia-from-neurons

### Enhancements Made

1. **Three-timescale precision**: Opening and Specious Present section now distinguish perceptual moment, specious present proper, and extended present as nested components — informed by specious present research insights
2. **Broken link fixes**: Two archived article references updated to current replacement articles

### Cross-links Updated
- `[[psychophysical-coupling-law]]` → `[[psychophysical-laws]]`
- `[[phenomenal-unity]]` → `[[phenomenal-binding-and-holism]]`

## Word Count

- Before: 2443 words (98% of 2500 threshold)
- After: 2460 words (98% of 2500 threshold)
- Change: +17 words (precision edits, length-neutral intent preserved)

## Remaining Items

None. The article remains stable with minor corrections applied.

## Stability Notes

This is the **fifth review** of this article. The article continues to be stable after four prior reviews marked it converged. This review addressed only:
- Two broken links from archived content (maintenance issue, not content flaw)
- Sharpened specious present duration language using three-timescale framework from research

**Bedrock disagreements remain philosophical, not fixable:**
1. MWI vs. collapse interpretation
2. Illusionism vs. realism about temporal experience
3. Panpsychism vs. interactionist dualism mechanism
4. Role of the self in mental time travel

**This article requires no further substantive review** unless content is materially modified or new connections emerge.
