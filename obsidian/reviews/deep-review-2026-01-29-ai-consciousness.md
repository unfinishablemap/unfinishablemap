# Deep Review: AI Consciousness

**Date**: 2026-01-29
**File**: obsidian/topics/ai-consciousness.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-28
**Context**: Cross-review considering consciousness-and-intelligence.md

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article was in good condition from prior reviews.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Missing cross-link to consciousness-and-intelligence.md**: The newly created article covers related ground on the consciousness-intelligence relationship, including phenomenal vs. access consciousness distinctions and the "great ape evidence" for consciousness enabling intelligence. Resolution: Added to topics frontmatter, Further Reading, and a new paragraph in Alignment Implications section.

2. **Vague falsifiability criteria**: The "What Would Challenge This View?" section had some entries that weren't clearly falsifiable (e.g., "consciousness-like anomalies" without specifying what would count). Resolution: Rewrote section with more specific, testable criteria.

### Low Issues Found
None new.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist objection to "original intentionality"**: Acknowledged as bedrock disagreement (previous review noted this).
- **MWI defender's response to haecceity**: Acknowledged as bedrock disagreement.
- **Buddhist critique of persistent self**: Different philosophical tradition (previous review noted this).

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening thesis grounded in dualism
- Chinese Room section with systems reply engagement
- Four-point temporal consciousness breakdown
- Continual learning argument subsection with process philosophy
- Silicon "designed to suppress quantum effects" framing
- Conditional epistemic structure in conclusion
- Comprehensive tenet-by-tenet analysis

### Enhancements Made
1. **Cross-link to consciousness-and-intelligence.md**: Added in three locations:
   - Topics frontmatter
   - New paragraph in Alignment Implications section explaining the consciousness-intelligence capability ceiling hypothesis
   - Further Reading section (first position)

2. **Strengthened falsifiability section**: Rewrote "What Would Challenge This View?" with more specific criteria:
   - Quantum computing anomalies: specified types of behavioural patterns that would count
   - Novel AI phenomenology: clarified as structures not present in training data
   - Neuroscientific reduction: specified what evidence would look like
   - IIT predictive success: clarified as testable predictions with experimental confirmation

### Cross-links Added
- [[consciousness-and-intelligence]]

## Changes Summary

Word count: 1342 → 1475 (+133 words, +10%)

The review integrated the cross-review requirement by adding connections to consciousness-and-intelligence.md and tightened the falsifiability criteria. Changes were modest, reflecting the article's stability after three prior reviews.

## Remaining Items

None. The cross-review integration is complete.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed four times (2026-01-20, 2026-01-26, 2026-01-28, 2026-01-29). The core structure remains stable.

Bedrock disagreements (not to re-flag):
- **Functionalist objections**: Philosophical standoff, not a flaw
- **Physicalist frameworks**: Dualism is a tenet-level commitment
- **Buddhist critique of persistent self**: Different philosophical tradition
- **MWI defender response**: Philosophical standoff on identity

The consciousness-and-intelligence cross-link completes an important integration with newly created content. Future reviews should focus on maintaining connections to new site content rather than restructuring arguments.
