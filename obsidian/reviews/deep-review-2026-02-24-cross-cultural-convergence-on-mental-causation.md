**Date**: 2026-02-24
**Article**: [[cross-cultural-convergence-on-mental-causation|Cross-Cultural Convergence on Mental Causation]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Wrong journal citation (Barlev & Shtulman)**: Referenced *Psychological Bulletin*, 147(12): 1297-1312 but the correct journal is *Psychological Review*, 128(6): 1007-1021. Fixed.
- **Barrett et al. findings understated**: Article said intuitive materialism "may be as common as" intuitive dualism, but Barrett et al. found materialism was the *default* response across six populations. Corrected to match the more accurate description in the sister article (the-convergence-argument-for-dualism). Also leveraged the stronger finding to improve the argument: if materialism is the cognitive default, philosophical convergence on mental causation is more impressive, not less.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Sāṃkhya mischaracterized as supporting mental causation**: The Map's own articles on Sāṃkhya describe *puruṣa* as "causally inert" and a "witness," yet the article presented Sāṃkhya's puruṣa-prakṛti interaction as evidence for mental causation. Fixed by reordering to lead with Nyāya (genuinely interactionist) and qualifying Sāṃkhya's role as supporting irreducibility rather than bidirectional causation. Added cross-reference to samkhya-three-way-distinction.
- **Contemplative evidence conflated physical and non-physical causation**: Meditation changing heart rate is compatible with physical-to-physical causation. Fixed by acknowledging the physicalist reading and clarifying that the evidential weight comes from the cross-cultural *interpretation* of these phenomena, not the physiological effects themselves.
- **Akan diacritics inconsistent**: "ōkra" with macron was non-standard and inconsistent with african-philosophy-of-consciousness article. Fixed to "okra."
- **Missing cross-links**: Added links to the-hard-problem-in-non-western-philosophy, samkhya-three-way-distinction, eastern-philosophy-consciousness, and witness-consciousness.
- **Path-style frontmatter link**: `[[concepts/epiphenomenalism]]` fixed to `[[epiphenomenalism]]` in both frontmatter and body.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist**: Folk psychology as shared error across traditions — article addresses this adequately through the cognitive architecture objection and Barrett et al. evidence.
- **Buddhist philosopher (Nagarjuna)**: Dependent origination challenges the framework of independent causal agency — addressed by adding a parenthetical noting Buddhist *anattā* as a complication to the agency convergence claim, with reference to the selection bias section.
- **Empiricist**: Contemplative evidence is compatible with physical causation — addressed by rewriting the contemplative section to acknowledge this and clarify where the evidential weight actually lies.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent opening paragraph with Bayesian framing of convergence
- Clean three-tradition organizational structure
- Honest objections section with genuine engagement
- Barrett et al. counter-evidence to "natural-born dualists" — now strengthened
- Sophisticated conceptual translation response (functional-level argument)

### Enhancements Made
- Leveraged Barrett et al. finding more effectively — cognitive default of materialism makes philosophical convergence *more* impressive
- Added Barlev & Shtulman citation to the argument text (previously only in references)
- Qualified Sāṃkhya claim for internal consistency with other Map articles
- Tightened contemplative evidence to be philosophically precise
- Added Buddhist *anattā* as an honest complication to the agency claim

### Cross-links Added
- [[the-hard-problem-in-non-western-philosophy]]
- [[samkhya-three-way-distinction]]
- [[eastern-philosophy-consciousness]]
- [[witness-consciousness]]

## Remaining Items

None — all critical and medium issues addressed.

## Stability Notes

- The article's treatment of Sāṃkhya now acknowledges that *puruṣa* is a witness rather than a causal agent. Future reviews should not re-introduce Sāṃkhya as an exemplar of mental causation—Nyāya serves that role for Indian philosophy.
- Buddhist *anattā* represents a genuine philosophical disagreement with the article's convergence claim on agency. The article acknowledges this honestly rather than resolving it. Future reviews should not flag this as a critical issue—it's a known limitation of the convergence pattern, not a flaw in the article.
- The contemplative evidence section now explicitly acknowledges the physicalist-compatible reading. This is the honest position. Future reviews should not attempt to strengthen the non-physical causation claim from contemplative evidence alone.
