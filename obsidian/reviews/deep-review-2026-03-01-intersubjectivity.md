**Date**: 2026-03-01
**Article**: [[intersubjectivity|Intersubjectivity]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-28-intersubjectivity|2026-01-28]]

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article has been through two prior deep reviews (2026-01-25, 2026-01-28) and a targeted pessimistic review (2026-02-20) that addressed the main substantive gaps. Attribution check passed cleanly — Husserl, Depraz, Lutz, Wittgenstein, Dennett, and Zahavi all accurately represented. No misattributions, dropped qualifiers, or source/Map conflation.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Stale AI refinement log**: Comment block (from 2026-02-20 pessimistic review) still present with note "remove after human review." Removed.
2. **Missing cross-link to intersubjective-void**: Created 2026-02-02, directly related void article that links back to this article. Added to concepts frontmatter, Further Reading, and body text (Husserl section).
3. **Missing cross-links to new articles**: `epistemology-of-other-minds-under-dualism` (created 2026-02-23) and `contemplative-epistemology` (created 2026-02-10) are directly relevant articles created since last review. Added to frontmatter and Further Reading.

### Low Issues Found
- Minor prose verbosity in second-person methodology and contemplative evidence sections — tightened to maintain length neutrality.

### Counterarguments Considered
All six adversarial personas applied:
- **Eliminative Materialist**: Neural convergence explanation — article now engages substantively with "neither consideration is decisive." Bedrock disagreement, stable.
- **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: Heterophenomenology bracketing — acknowledged as live methodological debate. Stable.
- **Quantum Skeptic**: N/A — article makes no quantum claims.
- **Many-Worlds Defender**: N/A — not relevant to intersubjectivity.
- **Empiricist**: Contemplative evidence confounds now acknowledged (since 2026-02-20 revision). Lutz et al. citation sound. Hogan twins appropriately hedged.
- **Buddhist Philosopher**: Mind-boundaries as constructed — bedrock framing difference with Map's dualism.

### Attribution Accuracy Check
- [x] All claims attributed to sources verified as accurate
- [x] No misattributed frameworks or constraints
- [x] Qualifiers preserved (e.g., "Reports suggest" for Hogan twins)
- [x] No overstated positions (exploratory vs. committal language appropriate)
- [x] Source/Map separation maintained throughout
- [x] No self-contradictions detected

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening summary: Excellent front-loading of what intersubjectivity is and why it matters for consciousness studies
- Objectivity vs. intersubjectivity distinction: Philosophically rigorous, clearly articulated
- Husserl's constitutive paradox: Deep insight that inaccessibility *constitutes* rather than blocks intersubjectivity
- Discourse argument: Original contribution with honest engagement of neural convergence explanation
- Non-reductive physicalism clarification: Exemplary philosophical honesty — distinguishes what intersubjectivity establishes (phenomenological realism) from what it doesn't (dualism)
- Limits section: Comprehensive and intellectually honest, covering linguistic mediation, experiential diversity, training effects, metaphysical neutrality, boundary contingency, and heterophenomenology
- Three-tenet connection: Substantive engagement with Dualism, Bidirectional Interaction, and Occam's Limits
- Confidence calibration: "Neither consideration is decisive," "the evidence remains contested" — exemplary throughout

### Enhancements Made
1. Added cross-link to [[intersubjective-void]] in Husserl section body text and Further Reading
2. Added cross-link to [[contemplative-epistemology]] in contemplative evidence section and Further Reading
3. Added [[epistemology-of-other-minds-under-dualism]] to related_articles and Further Reading
4. Removed stale AI refinement log comment (~120 words)
5. Tightened prose in second-person methodology and contemplative evidence sections

### Cross-links Added
- [[intersubjective-void]] — directly related void on whether experiences can be genuinely shared
- [[contemplative-epistemology]] — systematic treatment of contemplative practice as knowledge source
- [[epistemology-of-other-minds-under-dualism]] — dualist epistemology of knowing other minds

## Word Count Changes
- Before: 2570 words (103% of soft threshold)
- After: 2593 words (104% of soft threshold)
- Net: +23 words (length-neutral: log removal offset by cross-link additions)

## Remaining Items

None. The article is stable.

## Stability Notes

This article has now received three deep reviews (2026-01-25, 2026-01-28, 2026-03-01) plus a targeted pessimistic review (2026-02-20). It has reached stability. This review's changes were limited to cross-linking new articles created since the last review and removing a stale comment — no substantive content modifications were needed.

Future reviews should NOT re-flag:
- Eliminativist convergent architecture argument (bedrock disagreement, engaged honestly)
- Heterophenomenology debate (acknowledged as live, Map's position stated)
- Contemplative evidence confounds (acknowledged since 2026-02-20)
- Nagarjuna-style challenges to mind-boundaries (bedrock framing difference)
- Non-reductive physicalism gap (addressed with explicit clarification)

The article should only need future review if: (a) new directly relevant articles are created that warrant cross-linking, or (b) substantive content is modified.
