**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Article**: [[altered-states-as-void-probes|Altered States as Void Probes]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The article is well-structured, properly hedged, and aligns with site tenets.

### Medium Issues Found

- **Illusion interpretation underdeveloped**: Option 2 ("illusion of access") needed stronger engagement with the confabulation objection. Resolution: Added clarifying text noting that conviction of insight might reflect disrupted metacognition.
- **Confabulation objection unaddressed**: The dissolving-insight phenomenon could be dismissed as mere confabulation. Resolution: Added response noting consistency across practitioners and transformative effects as counter-evidence.
- **Quantum speculation thinly supported**: The original paragraph vaguely connected "suspending categorization" to quantum coherence. Resolution: Tightened to focus on REBUS model and predictive constraints without claiming direct quantum access.
- **Mysterianism not linked**: The noetic quality discussion referenced cognitive closure without linking to the mysterianism concept page. Resolution: Added [[mysterianism]] link inline.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Cross-method convergence could be neurobiological**: The convergence of mystical phenomenology across traditions might reflect convergent human neurobiology rather than shared access to territory beyond cognition. This is acknowledged implicitly—the article presents both transcendence and edge-mapping readings without forcing resolution.
- **Functionalist interpretation**: Dennett-style functionalists would interpret the phenomenology as narrative construction. The article presents this as a live option (the edge-mapping reading) rather than refuting it.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Excellent four-option framing of the central epistemological question (genuine access, illusion, edge-mapping, mixed)
- Well-integrated Bergson/Huxley/REBUS synthesis
- Strong "What Would Distinguish These Views?" section with concrete predictions
- Appropriately cautious NDE treatment
- Substantive "Relation to Site Perspective" connecting to all five tenets

### Enhancements Made

- Strengthened engagement with illusion/confabulation interpretation
- Tightened quantum speculation paragraph for better coherence
- Added [[mysterianism]] concept link
- Added [[near-death-experiences]] to concepts list

### Cross-links Added (Orphan Integration)

Inbound links added from:
- [[altered-states-of-consciousness]] — in defining ASCs section
- [[filter-theory]] — in psychedelic paradox section
- [[near-death-experiences]] — in conclusion
- [[three-kinds-of-void]] — in opening
- [[apophatic-approaches]] — in phenomenological attention section
- [[phenomenology-of-the-edge]] — in pharmacological intervention section

## Word Count

Before: 2011 words (101% of 2000 soft threshold)
After: 2035 words (102% of 2000 soft threshold)

Change: +24 words. Article remains at soft threshold—operated in length-neutral mode, additions offset by tightening.

## Remaining Items

None. Article is now integrated into site navigation with 6 inbound links from related articles.

## Stability Notes

This is the first deep review of this article (created 2026-02-03). Key points for future reviews:

- **Philosophical standoffs to respect as bedrock**: The tension between "genuine access" and "edge-mapping" readings is by design—the article does not force resolution. Future reviews should not treat this as a flaw requiring "stronger position-taking."
- **Quantum speculation appropriately hedged**: The article already notes speculation is "highly speculative." Don't expand quantum content without new evidence.
- **Cross-cultural convergence**: The article treats phenomenological convergence as epistemically significant. Eliminative materialists will always object this could be neurobiological. This disagreement is philosophical, not textual.

The article should stabilize after this review. Future reviews finding no critical issues should be considered success indicating the article has reached quality state.
