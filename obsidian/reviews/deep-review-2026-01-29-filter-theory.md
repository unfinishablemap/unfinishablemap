# Deep Review: Filter Theory of Consciousness

**Date**: 2026-01-29
**File**: obsidian/concepts/filter-theory.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-27
**Cross-review context**: default-mode-network.md

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. This is the article's third review. Previous critical issues remain properly resolved.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Missing cross-link to default-mode-network**: The article discussed DMN findings in the Psychedelic Paradox section without linking to the newly created [[default-mode-network]] article.
   - **Resolution**: Added [[default-mode-network]] to concepts frontmatter and inline link in Psychedelic Paradox section.

2. **Physicalist objection not explicitly stated**: The DMN article includes an explicit physicalist objection (lines 83-87), while filter-theory.md lacked similar direct engagement.
   - **Resolution**: Added explicit physicalist objection paragraph acknowledging "different neural processing produces different experience" before presenting filter interpretation.

3. **"Narrative filter" concept not cross-referenced**: The DMN article develops "The DMN as Narrative Filter" as a specific mechanism. Filter-theory.md could reference this more developed treatment.
   - **Resolution**: Added parenthetical reference to DMN article's "narrative filter" concept.

### Counterarguments Considered

All six adversarial personas engaged with the cross-review context:

1. **Eliminative Materialist**: Notes that "enhanced" experience during filter disruption is subjective report, not objective enhancement. **Status**: Bedrock disagreement—not a fixable flaw.

2. **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: Physicalist objection now explicitly acknowledged in the Psychedelic Paradox section.

3. **Quantum Skeptic**: No new issues. Decoherence objection appropriately deferred to [[quantum-consciousness]].

4. **Many-Worlds Defender**: Bedrock disagreement with Map's No MWI tenet.

5. **Empiricist**: Three predictions remain not fully operationalized—appropriate epistemic humility per previous review.

6. **Buddhist Philosopher**: anātman disanalogy from previous review remains well-integrated.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Historical development section (James, Bergson, Huxley) remains excellent
- Radio and rendering engine analogies effective
- Balanced NDE treatment (acknowledges 60% report nothing)
- Clear "Claims/Doesn't Claim" section prevents overreach
- Buddhism section with anātman disanalogy
- Comprehensive tenet integration

### Enhancements Made

- Added [[default-mode-network]] to concepts frontmatter
- Added inline link to DMN article in Psychedelic Paradox section
- Added explicit physicalist objection with response
- Added reference to DMN article's "narrative filter" concept
- Trimmed Meditative Cessation section for concision
- Trimmed "Received But Not Perceived" section
- Tightened Further Reading descriptions

### Cross-links Added

- [[default-mode-network]] — The brain's self-referential system as a specific filter mechanism

## Length Management

- **Word count before**: 3188
- **Word count after**: 3177
- **Net change**: -11 words
- **Status**: Soft warning (127% of 2500 threshold)

Operated in length-neutral mode: additions for cross-review integration were offset by trimming redundant content in Meditative Cessation and Received But Not Perceived sections.

## Remaining Items

None. All cross-review findings were addressed.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed three times (2026-01-19, 2026-01-27, 2026-01-29). The following remain bedrock philosophical disagreements rather than fixable problems:

1. **Eliminativism objection**: The Map explicitly endorses dualism; eliminative materialists will always reject the framing.

2. **MWI objection**: The Map explicitly rejects Many-Worlds Interpretation. MWI defenders finding the indexical identity argument unsatisfying is expected.

3. **Falsifiability concerns**: The article acknowledges the three predictions "aren't decisive tests." This is appropriate epistemic humility.

**Article stability**: This review made only cross-referencing refinements rather than structural changes. The article has reached stability. Future reviews should focus on:
- New related content requiring cross-linking (like this review's DMN integration)
- Factual updates if cited research changes
- Style guide compliance if guidelines evolve

The core arguments and structure are sound.
