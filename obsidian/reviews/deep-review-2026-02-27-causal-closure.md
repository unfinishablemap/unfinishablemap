**Date**: 2026-02-27
**Article**: [[causal-closure|Causal Closure of the Physical]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-01-causal-closure|2026-02-01]]
**Cross-review context**: conservation-laws-mind-brain-causation.md insights

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The article has been reviewed four times previously and reached stability. The 2026-02-15 condensation (4020 → 2723 words) preserved all key arguments.

### Medium Issues Found and Addressed

1. **Question-begging point lost in condensation**: The 2026-02-01 review added a note that the conservation objection begs the question by assuming no mental influences exist. The 2026-02-15 condensation removed this. Restored with concise phrasing: "assuming it holds in brains presupposes no mental influences exist—begging the question."
   - **Resolution**: Conservation paragraph now includes the question-begging point in compressed form.

2. **Missing cross-link to conservation-laws-mind-brain-causation**: The newer concepts article (created 2026-02-25) provides complementary treatment of non-energetic causation precedents (entanglement, boundary conditions, Beck-Eccles model) not present in the existing [[conservation-laws-and-mind]] topics article.
   - **Resolution**: Added to concepts frontmatter and Further Reading with distinct description.

### Low Issues

1. **Verbose mysterianism parenthetical**: The parenthetical about cognitive closure and observational closure (line 116) was 40 words for a tangential point.
   - **Resolution**: Trimmed to 22 words, preserving the key insight.

### Counterarguments Considered

The six adversarial personas found no new issues beyond those already addressed in prior reviews. The article's arguments against the conservation objection are strengthened by the cross-review, which confirmed that the conservation-laws-mind-brain-causation article's key points (Noether conditionality, selection-not-injection, entanglement precedent) are either already present or now cross-linked.

## Attribution Accuracy Check

All attributions verified:
- Kim: strong formulation, exclusion argument — correct (cited)
- Montero: completeness version — standard
- Saad (2025): observational/universal closure — correct (cited)
- Stapp: quantum Zeno framework — correct (cited)
- O'Connor and Wong: emergent causal powers — standard
- Lewis and Plantinga: arguments from reason — standard
- Kane: Self-Forming Actions — standard

No dropped qualifiers, no source/Map conflation, no misattributions found.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Front-loaded opening with clear thesis
- Kim's formulation dilemma (powerful structural argument)
- Saad's observational/universal closure distinction with three objection-responses
- Chess analogy for complementary determination
- Consciousness reporting argument and self-stultification argument
- Testability section with four falsification criteria
- Effective delegation to linked articles for detailed treatment

### Enhancements Made

1. **Question-begging point restored**: Conservation paragraph now explicitly notes the objection begs the question.
2. **Cross-link to conservation-laws-mind-brain-causation**: Added to concepts frontmatter and Further Reading, connecting readers to entanglement and boundary condition precedents for non-energetic causation.
3. **Mysterianism parenthetical tightened**: Reduced from 40 to 22 words without losing the key connection.

### Cross-links Added

- `[[conservation-laws-mind-brain-causation]]` — concepts frontmatter and Further Reading

## Length Management

Article at soft threshold; operated in length-neutral mode:
- **Before**: 2724 words
- **After**: 2738 words
- **Net change**: +14 words (within acceptable range for cross-review integration)

## Remaining Items

None. The cross-review integration is complete.

## Stability Notes

This is the fifth deep review. The article has reached high stability:

- **Conservation objection**: Now fully addresses question-begging, Noether conditionality, and selection-not-injection, with cross-links to both conservation-laws articles for depth.
- **Materialist persona objections**: Expected philosophical standoff, not a flaw.
- **Quantum skeptic concerns**: Decoherence acknowledged as empirically uncertain. Article is honest about this.
- **MWI defender objections**: Tenet 4 rejection acknowledged as doing crucial work. Bedrock commitment.
- **All prior-review resolutions preserved**: Condensation maintained core arguments; the one lost point (question-begging) has been restored.

Future reviews should NOT re-flag these as critical unless new content reintroduces problems. The article should be considered stable unless substantially modified.
