**Date**: 2026-02-25
**Article**: [[adaptive-computational-depth|Adaptive Computational Depth]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-24b-adaptive-computational-depth|2026-02-24]] (orphan integration, added 5 inbound links)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article remains stable after two previous reviews on 2026-02-24. All six adversarial personas engaged with the content and found no new issues.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing outbound cross-link**: The Epistemological Status section discussed bandwidth constraints without linking to [[attentional-economics]], which describes the same principle in economic terms. **Resolved**: Added outbound link.

### Counterarguments Considered
No new counterarguments beyond those already addressed. The self-allocation objection, MWI incompatibility, and unfalsifiability are all handled and documented as bedrock disagreements in the previous review.

### Attribution Accuracy Check
All 6 source attributions verified:
- Wheeler (1990): Direct quote verified, "participatory universe" paraphrase fair
- Bostrom (2003): "Powerful computational shortcuts" accurately paraphrased, premise rejection clearly noted
- Wolfram (2002): Computational irreducibility accurately described, Map's inference clearly labeled ("The Map draws an inference")
- Irwin et al. (2020): "Principle of Efficient Language" correctly attributed, panconsciousness framework distinguished from Map's dualism
- Penrose (1994): Non-computability argument accurately cited
- Faizal et al. (2025): Appropriately hedged ("Whether or not this specific proof withstands scrutiny")

No attribution errors, dropped qualifiers, or source/Map conflation found.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening summary effectively front-loads the non-computability insight
- Source progression (Wheeler → Bostrom → Wolfram → Irwin → Penrose → Faizal) builds cumulatively
- Honest epistemological status section acknowledging unfalsifiability
- Comprehensive five-tenet coverage with specific connections
- Five concrete falsifiers in "What Would Challenge This View?"
- Prebiotic Question section appropriately brief with cross-reference

### Enhancements Made
Primary focus: **extended orphan integration**. The previous review added 5 inbound links. This review adds 6 more from thematically related articles, plus 1 new outbound link.

### Cross-links Added

**New outbound link from adaptive-computational-depth:**
1. **[[attentional-economics]]** — Added in Epistemological Status section where bandwidth constraints are discussed. Natural connection: attention allocation as a scarce resource.

**New inbound links (6 articles → adaptive-computational-depth):**
1. **[[neural-bandwidth-constraints-and-the-interface]]** — In Policy-Level selection section. Natural connection: coarse-grained selection mirrors adaptive depth.
2. **[[attentional-economics]]** — In bandwidth constraint paragraph. Natural connection: adaptive depth is the flip side of attentional scarcity.
3. **[[phenomenal-depth]]** — In Depth, Access, and Training section. Natural connection: trained attention may elicit more phenomenal structure, paralleling adaptive depth's detail-follows-attention principle.
4. **[[attention-as-selection-interface]]** — In Bandwidth Constraint subsection. Natural connection: the selection pattern echoes adaptive computational depth.
5. **[[metaphysics-of-information-under-dualism]]** — In Option 4: Information as Interface Medium. Natural connection: informational resolution varies with conscious engagement.
6. **[[machine-consciousness]]** — In Alternative Substrates section. Natural connection: non-computable allocator cannot be replicated computationally.

### Word Count
1682 → 1693 (+11 words). Well within soft threshold of 2500.

## Remaining Items

None. The article now has **11 inbound links** from content articles spanning:
- Simulation, participatory universe, physics of information, neural selection, prebiotic collapse (from previous review)
- Neural bandwidth, attentional economics, phenomenal depth, attention-as-selection, metaphysics of information, machine consciousness (from this review)

## Stability Notes

- The article has reached full stability after 3 reviews. Content changes were minimal (1 outbound link added).
- The self-allocation objection remains a bedrock philosophical disagreement (documented in previous review).
- MWI incompatibility is a fundamental tenet commitment, not a fixable flaw.
- Unfalsifiability of consciousness-based quantum interpretations is characteristic of the entire Map framework.
- The article is now thoroughly integrated into the site's navigation graph. Future reviews should not need to focus on orphan integration.
