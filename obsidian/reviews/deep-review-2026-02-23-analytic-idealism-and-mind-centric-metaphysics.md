## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article is well-constructed with no factual errors, no misattributions, no internal contradictions, and all required sections present.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Tononi grouped with Goff as "panpsychist" without distinction**: The original text listed "Philip Goff, Giulio Tononi" as examples of "contemporary panpsychism" without noting that Russellian panpsychism and IIT are substantially different theories. **Resolution**: Expanded the panpsychism section to distinguish Russellian panpsychism (Goff) from IIT (Tononi), explaining each approach separately. Added cross-link to [[russellian-monism]].

2. **Panpsychism's causation oversimplified**: The diagnostic question on causation described panpsychism as "consciousness rides along," which mischaracterises Russellian panpsychism where consciousness IS the intrinsic nature of physical causation. **Resolution**: Rewrote the panpsychism causation entry to reflect Russellian panpsychism's view accurately and note the combination problem for constitutive panpsychism.

3. **Missing cross-link to russellian-monism**: The panpsychism section discussed Russellian ideas without linking to the existing concept page. **Resolution**: Added wikilink and frontmatter entry.

4. **Missing cross-link to witness-consciousness**: The idealism discussion of individual identity was relevant to contemplative evidence but didn't connect to existing content. **Resolution**: Added a passage in "What's at Stake" connecting witness-consciousness reports to filter theory as a dualist alternative to idealist interpretation.

### Counterarguments Considered

1. **Idealism's parsimony argument**: Already well-addressed in the article — the "intrinsic structure of universal consciousness" plays the functional role of physical law.
2. **Contemplative evidence for universal consciousness**: Addressed by adding filter theory as alternative interpretation of witness-consciousness experiences.
3. **Epiphenomenalism concern for panpsychism**: Already noted in the Map's Position section.
4. **Empirical distinguishability**: Considered adding a section on whether these frameworks make different empirical predictions. Deferred — the article is a comparative overview and adding this would expand beyond its natural scope. The separate analytic-idealism concept page already covers this.

### Attribution Accuracy Check

All attributions passed:
- Kastrup's positions (sole ontological primitive, dissociated alters, matter as appearance) — accurate
- Goff's Russellian panpsychism — accurate
- Tononi's IIT — now accurately distinguished from Russellian panpsychism
- Shani's cosmopsychism — accurate
- Spinoza and Russell for dual-aspect/neutral monism — standard attributions
- No dropped qualifiers, no source/Map conflation, no self-contradictions

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- **Three diagnostic questions framework** — genuinely useful comparative tool (matter, causation, identity)
- **Gains/losses structure** — creates balanced, fair treatment of each framework
- **Opening paragraph** — immediately scopes the comparison and front-loads the key questions
- **"Idealism would be the less wrong option"** — rare intellectual honesty that builds reader trust
- **"What's at Stake" section** — effectively connects abstract metaphysics to agency and individual significance
- **Author's voice** — confident but not dismissive; exploratory rather than dogmatic

### Enhancements Made

1. Distinguished Russellian panpsychism from IIT in the panpsychism section
2. Corrected causation characterisation for panpsychism in the diagnostic questions
3. Added witness-consciousness and filter theory connection in "What's at Stake"
4. Added cross-links to russellian-monism and witness-consciousness (frontmatter, body, Further Reading)

### Cross-links Added

- [[russellian-monism]] — in panpsychism section and Further Reading
- [[witness-consciousness]] — in What's at Stake section and Further Reading
- [[combination-problem]] — additional inline link in causation diagnostic question

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues addressed.

## Stability Notes

This is the first review of this article. The following represent philosophical disagreements inherent in the content, not fixable issues:

- **Eliminative materialists** will contest the opening claim that the explanatory gap hasn't narrowed. This reflects the Map's position and is consistent with its tenets.
- **MWI proponents** will find the characterisation of identity-spreading across branches unsatisfying. This is a bedrock disagreement.
- The article treats "physicalism fails" as given without detailed argument. This is appropriate for a comparative piece — the argument is made in other Map articles (hard-problem-of-consciousness, explanatory-gap).
