**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Article**: [[coupling-modes|Coupling Modes]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-31-coupling-modes|2026-01-31]]

## Review Context

This review was triggered by orphan status: coupling-modes.md had no inbound links despite being highly relevant to multiple core articles. Primary focus was site integration through cross-references.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The previous review (2026-01-31) addressed all critical issues including the Eccles attribution error and decoherence understatement.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Orphan status**: Article had zero inbound links despite high relevance to psychophysical-coupling, stapp-quantum-mind, quantum-consciousness, attention-as-interface, measurement-problem, bidirectional-interaction, and mental-causation.
   - **Resolution**: Added cross-references from 7 related articles (see below).

### Counterarguments Considered

All counterarguments from the previous review remain addressed:
- **Eliminative Materialist**: Taxonomy is useful even if dualism is rejected (framework article, not argument for dualism).
- **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: "Stealthy" modes acknowledged as methodological tension (line 85-86).
- **Quantum Skeptic**: Decoherence severity properly documented with numbers.
- **Many-Worlds Defender**: Bedrock disagreement (tenet-level commitment).
- **Empiricist**: Falsifiability criteria present (lines 141-142).
- **Buddhist Philosopher**: Selector substantiality is a general concern, not specific to coupling modes.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Clear three-mode taxonomy (basis/timing/probability)
- Comparison table for quick comprehension
- Minimality analysis connecting to tenets
- Synthesis proposal combining modes
- Honest acknowledgment of limitations
- Well-structured Further Reading section

### Enhancements Made

No content changes to coupling-modes.md itself (article has stabilized).

### Cross-links Added

Added inbound links from 7 articles:

1. **psychophysical-coupling.md**: Added coupling-modes reference in Candidate Coupling Laws section and Further Reading
2. **stapp-quantum-mind.md**: Added reference explaining Stapp uses basis+timing control, plus Further Reading link
3. **quantum-consciousness.md**: Added sentence after "What These Theories Share" explaining how theories differ by coupling mode, plus Further Reading link
4. **attention-as-interface.md**: Added reference in bandwidth constraint section and Further Reading
5. **measurement-problem.md**: Added reference in consciousness-based interpretations section and Further Reading
6. **bidirectional-interaction.md**: Added reference explaining coupling mode differences between Stapp and Penrose-Hameroff, plus Further Reading link
7. **mental-causation.md**: Added reference after candidate mechanisms list explaining coupling modes, plus Further Reading link

## Word Count

Before: 1985 words
After: 1985 words (no changes to coupling-modes.md itself)
Status: Well within soft threshold of 2500 for concepts/

## Remaining Items

None. Article has reached stability. Orphan status resolved.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed twice. The content is stable:

1. **Three-mode taxonomy is foundational**: basis/timing/probability distinction provides conceptual clarity that won't need revision.

2. **Minimality ranking is well-argued**: The comparative analysis correctly identifies basis control as most minimal.

3. **Bedrock disagreements remain bedrock**: MWI defenders, physicalists, and eliminativists will continue to object on principled grounds. These are expected philosophical disagreements, not flaws.

4. **Integration complete**: With 7 inbound links from core articles, coupling-modes is now properly integrated into site navigation.

Future reviews should focus on whether new research affects the coupling modes taxonomy (new mechanisms, revised decoherence timescales, etc.) rather than re-examining the existing arguments.
