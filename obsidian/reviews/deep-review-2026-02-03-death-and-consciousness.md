**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Article**: [[death-and-consciousness|Death and Consciousness]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-28-death-and-consciousness|2026-01-28]]
**Context**: Cross-review considering newly published [[death-void]]

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The previous reviews (2026-01-20, 2026-01-28) addressed all critical gaps. This cross-review found no new critical issues.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **AI refinement log still present**: The condensation log from 2026-02-02 contained "This log should be removed after human review." **Resolution**: Removed.

### Counterarguments Considered

All major counterarguments remain adequately addressed from previous reviews:
- Illusionist denial (three responses in dedicated section)
- Decoherence objection (acknowledged with caveats)
- Buddhist no-self (engaged via "The Buddhist Complication")
- Parfit's pattern-view (well-addressed in original)

The adversarial personas found philosophical disagreements but no article flaws requiring correction.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Parfit critique with clear indexical/pattern distinction
- Patient KC case study illustrating autonoetic loss
- Filter theory framing with acknowledged limitations
- Calibrated epistemic claims ("doesn't prove survival")
- Five-tenet connections with cross-references
- Process philosophy alternative framework
- Falsifiability conditions showing intellectual honesty

### Enhancements Made

1. **Lucretian asymmetry connection**: Added explicit mention of the Lucretian asymmetry from death-void article to strengthen the Parfit discussion. The asymmetry (we fear posthumous nonexistence but not prenatal nonexistence) directly supports the Map's view that indexical identity matters.

2. **Death-void in Further Reading**: Added explicit link to death-void in the Further Reading section.

3. **Cleanup**: Removed AI refinement log that was marked for removal after human review.

### Cross-links Added

- [[death-void]] added to Further Reading section

## Word Count

Before: 2663 words (89% of soft threshold)
After: 2713 words (90% of soft threshold)
Change: +50 words (+2%)

## Remaining Items

None. The article maintains stability while now better integrating with the death-void content.

## Stability Notes

This article has reached convergence. Two previous deep reviews (2026-01-20, 2026-01-28) addressed all substantive gaps. This cross-review made only targeted integration improvements.

**Bedrock disagreements** that should NOT be re-flagged in future reviews:
- MWI proponents finding indexical arguments unsatisfying (philosophical standoff)
- Eliminativists rejecting folk psychology categories (tenet-level disagreement)
- Illusionists finding the three responses insufficient (the debate continues)
- Buddhist philosophers noting haecceity as a form of clinging (genuine philosophical difference)

**Cross-reference status**: The article now appropriately integrates with death-void through:
- In-text reference with Lucretian asymmetry mention (paragraph 2)
- Explicit link in Further Reading
- Shared conceptual vocabulary (cognitive aversion, witness consciousness)

The article represents the Map's considered position on death and consciousness. Future reviews should focus on factual accuracy and style compliance, not re-litigating resolved philosophical objections.
