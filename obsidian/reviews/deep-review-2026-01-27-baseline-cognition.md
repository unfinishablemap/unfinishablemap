**Date**: 2026-01-27
**Article**: [[baseline-cognition|Baseline Cognition]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-25-baseline-cognition|2026-01-25]]
**Context**: Cross-review considering consciousness-as-intelligence-amplifier

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Six adversarial personas reviewed the document:

### Eliminative Materialist (Churchland)
- The baseline/conscious distinction may track functional differences rather than phenomenal states
- *Assessment*: Medium issue; addressed in prior review via illusionism section; response adequate

### Hard-Nosed Physicalist (Dennett)
- Procedural/declarative distinction doesn't necessarily map to unconscious/conscious
- *Assessment*: Medium issue; addressed in illusionism section with argument from reason

### Quantum Skeptic (Tegmark)
- Quantum mechanisms appropriately hedged
- *Assessment*: Low; no issues

### Many-Worlds Defender (Deutsch)
- "Settling" argument articulated; this remains bedrock disagreement
- *Assessment*: N/A (philosophical standoff, not fixable flaw)

### Empiricist (Popper)
- Reliance on Lieberman et al. appropriately hedged
- Cross-review note: consistent with consciousness-as-amplifier citations
- *Assessment*: Low; hedging appropriate

### Buddhist Philosopher (Nagarjuna)
- Article acknowledges degrees/kinds of consciousness
- *Assessment*: Low; appropriately nuanced

### Critical Issues Found
None. Previous review addressed major issues.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Cross-reference clarity**: The bidirectional relationship with consciousness-as-intelligence-amplifier could be more explicit
   - *Resolution*: Added explicit cross-reference in opening paragraph

### Counterarguments Considered
All major counterarguments were already addressed in prior review (illusionism, epiphenomenalism).

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

Six sympathetic personas reviewed the document:

### Property Dualist (Chalmers)
- Opening clearly distinguishes phenomenal from access consciousness
- Systematic correspondence argument well-articulated

### Quantum Mind Theorist (Stapp)
- Appropriately cautious about quantum mechanisms

### Phenomenologist (Nagel)
- Procedural/declarative distinction is phenomenologically precise
- "Experience without experiencing that they experience" is a strong formulation

### Process Philosopher (Whitehead)
- Contemplative Perspectives section engages Whitehead substantively

### Libertarian Free Will Defender (Kane)
- Free will implications section makes connection explicit

### Mysterian (McGinn)
- Epistemic limits acknowledged appropriately

### Strengths Preserved
- Core hypothesis articulation in opening
- Domain-by-domain evidence structure
- Illusionism and epiphenomenalism challenge sections
- All five tenet connections
- Tables for procedural/declarative distinction and theory of mind levels

### Enhancements Made
- Added explicit cross-reference to consciousness-as-amplifier in opening paragraph
- Clarified bidirectional relationship ("This article characterises the starting point; consciousness-as-amplifier details how consciousness transforms it")
- Updated Further Reading description for consistency

### Cross-links Verified
- [[consciousness-as-amplifier]] resolves correctly to obsidian/concepts/consciousness-as-amplifier.md

## Length Check

**Before**: 3283 words (131% of 2500 soft threshold)
**After**: ~3288 words (minimal change, length-neutral edits)
**Status**: Soft warning (below hard threshold of 3500)

Operated in length-neutral mode: addition to opening balanced by tightening Further Reading description.

## Remaining Items

None. The article is stable after two prior reviews. This cross-review confirmed:
- The relationship with consciousness-as-intelligence-amplifier is now explicitly bidirectional
- No critical issues remain
- Counterarguments are adequately addressed
- Tenet connections are complete

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed three times (2026-01-22, 2026-01-25, 2026-01-27). The prior review marked it as having no remaining items, and this cross-review confirms stability. Key philosophical disagreements noted:

- **MWI proponents** will continue to find the "settling" argument unsatisfying—this is a bedrock disagreement about what selection means, not a fixable flaw.
- **Eliminative materialists** will object that "consciousness" may not carve nature at joints—the article's illusionism response addresses this but cannot resolve fundamental ontological disagreements.
- **Hard physicalists** can always retreat to "it's functional all the way down"—the argument from reason provides the Map's response but won't convince committed functionalists.

These are expected philosophical standoffs given the Map's tenet commitments. Future reviews should not re-flag them as critical issues.
