# Deep Review: The Measurement Problem

**Date**: 2026-01-25
**File**: obsidian/concepts/measurement-problem.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-25T18:06:13+00:00 (review 27)
**Review number**: 28 (user-requested)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Decoherence objection inadequately resolved**: The Tegmark objection was raised and Stapp's response noted, but the article admitted it was "a serious problem" without providing clear resolution.
   - **Resolution**: Restructured to clearly separate Stapp's specific mechanism (which may fail) from the broader philosophical point (which survives). Clarified the burden of proof and what would remain regardless of mechanism.

2. **Zombie argument cited without addressing objections**: Article relied on zombie/knowledge arguments without noting they're contested.
   - **Resolution**: Added acknowledgment that "these arguments are contested" with pointer to [[arguments-for-dualism]] for full treatment.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **MWI self-locating uncertainty potentially mischaracterized**: Original text claimed self-locating uncertainty "presupposes one world with a determinate but unknown fact."
   - **Resolution**: Reframed the objection more precisely—the challenge is uncertainty about which *future* copy you'll be when all copies will exist. Distinguishes between uncertainty about existing positions vs. future copies.

2. **"Quantum indeterminacy appears ontologically fundamental" stated too confidently**: This is interpretation-dependent.
   - **Resolution**: Added qualifier "on most interpretations" and noted superdeterminism as alternative to hidden variables.

3. **Verbose functionalist response**: Original paragraph was somewhat repetitive.
   - **Resolution**: Tightened prose, removing redundancy while preserving core argument.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Dennett's functionalist position**: The article's response was adequate but could be more concise. Tightened.
- **Wallace's decision-theoretic derivation**: The response was slightly verbose. Condensed while keeping the core dilemma.
- **Tegmark's decoherence objection**: This required the most significant restructuring—now clearly separated mechanism from philosophy.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Opening paragraph with Bell quote—excellent framing
- "Honest limitation" paragraph—builds credibility through intellectual honesty
- Parallel between measurement problem and hard problem
- Stapp section's presentation of Zeno as working within orthodox QM
- Indexical dimension's core insight
- Causal closure loophole section structure
- Multi-observer resolution using interface-locality

### Enhancements Made

1. Clearer separation of Stapp's mechanism from broader philosophical claim
2. More precise characterization of MWI self-locating uncertainty objection
3. Acknowledgment of contestation around zombie/knowledge arguments
4. Interpretation-qualified claim about quantum indeterminacy
5. Tightened prose throughout (net reduction: 46 words)

### Cross-links

All existing cross-links retained. The article already had strong linking to:
- [[arguments-for-dualism]] (now with explicit note about contestation)
- [[mysterianism-cognitive-closure]]
- [[qualia]]
- All relevant concepts and tenets

## Word Count

- Before: 2484 words (99% of 2500 soft threshold)
- After: 2438 words (98% of 2500 soft threshold)
- Change: -46 words

Operated in length-neutral mode given proximity to threshold. All additions balanced by equivalent condensation.

## Remaining Items

None. The article is well-developed and has received extensive review (this is review 28). Key improvements from this session:
- Decoherence challenge now clearly framed as problem for specific mechanism, not overall position
- MWI objection more precisely stated
- Appropriate epistemic humility about contested arguments added
