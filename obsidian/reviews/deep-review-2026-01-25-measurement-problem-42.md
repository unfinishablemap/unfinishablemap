# Deep Review: The Measurement Problem

**Date**: 2026-01-25
**File**: obsidian/concepts/measurement-problem.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-25T21:15:00+00:00 (review #41)
**Word count**: 2378 → 2395 (+17 words, 96% of soft threshold)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Unsupported claim about experimental developments** (line 120): The phrase "recent experimental developments that complicate Tegmark's original calculation" was vague and unsupported. **Resolution**: Removed the unsupported claim; strengthened acknowledgment that the decoherence objection "remains severe."

2. **Mischaracterization of Wallace's decision-theoretic argument**: The article dismissed Wallace's Born probability derivation as merely telling agents "how to act given probabilities" without acknowledging the sophistication of his position. **Resolution**: Revised to acknowledge Wallace's argument that probabilities *just are* rational credences, while maintaining the Map's disagreement is that this "changes the subject."

### Medium Issues Found

- **Stapp's response to decoherence**: The response that Zeno effects require "observation events, not persistent coherence" was presented weakly. **Resolution**: Tightened the passage and acknowledged the objection "remains severe" rather than hand-waving toward unspecified developments.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Decision-theoretic derivation of Born probabilities**: Now characterized more fairly—Wallace's position is philosophically serious. The Map's disagreement is framed as a dispute about what question is being answered, not a dismissal of the derivation.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Opening paragraph with Bell quote and framing of "logical space"
- "Honest limitation" paragraph—excellent philosophical writing acknowledging unfalsifiability while defending explanatory value
- Indexical dimension section linking measurement problem to hard problem structure
- Causal closure loophole section with three clear features (no energy violation, genuine indeterminacy, right location)
- Multi-observer coordination resolution via interface-locality
- Relation to Site Perspective section with clear tenet connections

### Enhancements Made

- Wallace's MWI response now characterized more fairly—acknowledges the argument's sophistication
- Decoherence challenge section is more honest about the severity of the objection

### Cross-links Verified

- All frontmatter concept links present and appropriate
- `[[mental-effort]]` mentioned appropriately
- `[[decoherence]]` link maintained without unsupported claims

## Remaining Items

None—the critical issues were addressed. The article remains at 96% of the soft threshold, operating in length-neutral mode. Future reviews should continue to balance accuracy against length constraints.
