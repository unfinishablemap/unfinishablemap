**Date**: 2026-02-15
**Article**: [[causal-powers|Causal Powers]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Broken wikilinks**: `[[dispositions]]` and `[[powers-metaphysics]]` referenced files that do not exist. Resolution: Removed from frontmatter concepts and Further Reading; replaced with links to existing articles (`[[causal-closure]]`, `[[agent-causation]]`, `[[consciousness-and-causal-powers]]`, `[[objections-to-interactionism]]`).
- **Missing full site name**: All references used "The Map's" without ever introducing "The Unfinishable Map" as required by the writing style guide. Resolution: Changed first mention (line 42) to "The Unfinishable Map's".
- **Description field described process, not content**: Original description ("iterative refinement, collaborative human-AI dialogue") was meaningless to readers. Resolution: Rewritten to describe the article's actual argument.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Finkish disposition attribution**: The term "finkish" was coined by Lewis (1997), not Martin (1994). Martin introduced the counterexample. Resolution: Clarified attribution and added Lewis 1997 to References.
- **Molière/dormitive virtue objection unaddressed**: Applying powers talk to consciousness risks being merely redescriptive rather than explanatory. Resolution: Added a paragraph in "Relation to Site Perspective" acknowledging this gap and pointing to how the Map addresses it.
- **Quantum decoherence not flagged as contested**: The article invoked quantum branch points in neural systems without noting this is disputed. Resolution: Added a sentence flagging the decoherence objection with a link to `[[objections-to-interactionism]]`.
- **Neutral monism introduced then dropped**: The three-position taxonomy mentioned neutral monism without explaining why the Map rejects it. Resolution: Expanded neutral monism description with a brief explanation of why the Map favours powers realism.
- **No empirical grounding acknowledged**: The article presented the powers framework without noting the gap between physical powers (empirically characterised) and mental powers (not). Resolution: Addressed in the new Molière objection paragraph.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist**: "Consciousness" may not be a coherent natural kind with definite causal powers. Acknowledged as a philosophical standoff; the Map's framework takes consciousness seriously by commitment.
- **Dennettian/dormitive virtue**: Powers talk about consciousness may redescribe rather than explain. Addressed directly in new paragraph.
- **Quantum skeptic/decoherence**: Quantum branch points may not be available in warm brains. Flagged with cross-link.
- **Many-worlds**: "Selection" among outcomes presupposes collapse. The Map rejects MWI as a tenet; the collapse-dependence of the powers framework is now more transparent.
- **Empiricist/falsifiability**: Conscious causal powers may be unfalsifiable. Acknowledged as an open challenge.
- **Buddhist/relational**: Powers realism reifies intrinsic natures that may be relational. Not addressed directly; this represents a deeper metaphysical disagreement.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening paragraph's concrete-then-abstract approach (fire/consciousness pairing)
- Three-position taxonomy (powers realism, categoricalism, neutral monism)
- Finkish disposition argument as anti-reductionist tool
- "Constrained causal power" formulation in Relation to Site Perspective
- Dispositional essentialism grounding psychophysical laws as non-contingent

### Enhancements Made
- Expanded neutral monism treatment to show why the Map prefers powers realism
- Added Molière objection acknowledgement with honest assessment of the empirical gap
- Flagged decoherence as contested while preserving the conceptual point
- Clarified finkish disposition attribution (Martin counterexample, Lewis terminology)
- Significantly expanded cross-linking to existing site content

### Cross-links Added
- [[causal-closure]]
- [[agent-causation]]
- [[objections-to-interactionism]]
- [[free-will]]
- [[consciousness-and-causal-powers]] (in Further Reading, replacing broken links)

## Remaining Items

None requiring immediate follow-up. The article is now well-connected to the site's existing content and addresses the main philosophical objections at an appropriate level for a concept page.

## Stability Notes

- The Dennettian "dormitive virtue" objection and the empiricist falsifiability challenge are acknowledged but not fully resolved. These represent genuine limitations of applying the powers framework to consciousness. Future reviews should NOT re-flag these as critical—they are philosophical challenges that the Map openly acknowledges rather than ignores.
- The Many-Worlds challenge is addressed by tenet commitment (No Many Worlds). The article's framework is collapse-dependent by design. This is a bedrock disagreement, not a flaw.
- The Buddhist/relational challenge to intrinsic natures is a deeper metaphysical disagreement that the article is not obligated to resolve. Future reviews should not treat this as a gap.
