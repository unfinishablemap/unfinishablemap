**Date**: 2026-02-23
**Article**: [[contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness|Contemplative Evidence for Consciousness]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-23-contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness|2026-02-23]]

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article has reached stability after the Feb 22 refinement (which fixed conflation of causal efficacy with non-physical causation and the eliminability non-sequitur) and the earlier Feb 23 review (which added Galilean exclusion cross-links and tightened prose).

### Medium Issues Found
- [Description too long (225 chars vs 150-160 target)]: Trimmed from "Cross-traditional contemplative findings that distinguish between theories of consciousness—eliminating epiphenomenalism and reductive materialism, and honestly assessing what separates dualism from non-reductive physicalism" to "Cross-traditional contemplative evidence eliminates epiphenomenalism and reductive materialism, honestly assessing what separates dualism from physicalism." (155 chars). Preserves key content while meeting SEO/social card length requirements.

### Low Issues Noted
- Six references in the References section are not cited in body text (Davidson et al. 2012, Lutz & Thompson 2003, Lutz et al. 2020, Parkinson et al. 2022, Petitmengin 2006, Thompson 2007). These are foundational works in contemplative neuroscience and neurophenomenology that inform the article's perspective. Left as-is — providing a broader bibliography of relevant works is standard academic practice.
- AI refinement log (HTML comment, lines 209-223) says "should be removed after human review." Human has not reviewed; left in place per its own instruction.

### Attribution Accuracy Check
- **Misattribution check**: All claims correctly attributed. No issues found.
- **Qualifier preservation check**: Appropriately calibrated language throughout ("corroborated by," "favours," "supports the thesis").
- **Position strength check**: No overstated positions. The "favours but does not eliminate" calibration for NRP is maintained.
- **Source/Map separation check**: Clean separation. Map's position explicitly labeled ("The Unfinishable Map holds that...").
- **Self-contradiction check**: No internal contradictions. Consistent throughout.

### Counterarguments Considered
All six adversarial personas engaged. No new counterarguments beyond what previous reviews identified:
- Eliminativist: convergence reflects shared neurobiology → article addresses via bootstrapping response
- Physicalist: bidirectional causation is common ground → article explicitly acknowledges
- Empiricist: citation precision, case study limitations → addressed in prior reviews
- Buddhist: simplified anattā treatment → serves comparative purpose (stability note from prior review)

These represent bedrock philosophical disagreements, not fixable flaws.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Two-stage evidential structure (convergence → theory testing) — elegant and original
- Honest non-reductive physicalism assessment — "favours" without "eliminating"
- "Where Convergence Fails" — genuine intellectual honesty including selection bias acknowledgment
- Galilean exclusion cross-links (added in earlier review) strengthen the explanatory gap argument
- Falsifiability section — makes concrete, defeasible predictions
- Cessation dissociation — appropriately weakened ("methodologically weak")
- Free will connection — brief but effective
- Comprehensive cross-links throughout (17+ wikilinks in body, 17 in Further Reading)

### Enhancements Made
- Trimmed description to 155 characters (from 225) for proper SEO/social card display

### Cross-links Added
None needed — the article already has extensive cross-linking after the earlier review.

## Remaining Items

- AI refinement log (HTML comment) should be removed after human review — not an AI task

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed twice on 2026-02-23 and once on 2026-02-22 (on predecessor content). It has reached clear stability:

- The Feb 22 refinement resolved the major logical issues (causal efficacy conflation, eliminability non-sequitur)
- The first Feb 23 review added Galilean exclusion cross-links and tightened prose
- This second Feb 23 review found only one medium issue (description length) — an objective, measurable deviation rather than a content judgment

Future reviews should recognise this article as stable and focus review effort elsewhere unless the article is substantively modified. Philosophical disagreements from adversarial personas (eliminativists on convergence, physicalists on bidirectional causation) are expected standoffs documented in prior reviews.

The non-reductive physicalism section's honest "favours but does not eliminate" calibration is a deliberate strength. Future reviews must not attempt to "strengthen" the dualist case at the expense of this epistemic honesty.
