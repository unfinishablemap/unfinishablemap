# Deep Review: Buddhism and Dualism

**Date**: 2026-01-27
**File**: obsidian/concepts/buddhism-and-dualism.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-19

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The article had been substantially improved in the previous review.

### Medium Issues Found

- **Yogācāra *ālaya-vijñāna* connection to mental causation was hand-wavy**: The previous text asserted the storehouse "transmits causal influence" without explaining the mechanism.
- **Resolution**: Expanded to clarify that *ālaya-vijñāna* is causally active—karmic seeds ripen into effects, new actions deposit seeds. This is genuine transmission of causal influence through an impermanent medium, not mere recording.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Eliminative materialist objection**: Buddhist aggregates (*skandhas*) are a reductive psychological analysis, not metaphysical claims about irreducibility. The candle flame is entirely reducible to combustion chemistry.
- **Response**: The article already acknowledges this interpretation exists (lines 36-37). This represents a bedrock disagreement about what Buddhist psychology is doing, not a flaw to fix.

- **Dennett-style heterophenomenology**: Buddhism accepts that "experience happens" functionally, compatible with no irreducible qualia.
- **Response**: This was addressed in the previous review. The emptiness challenge section engages with this objection. Bedrock disagreement.

- **MWI challenge to karma**: In Everettian physics, every action is taken in some branch, potentially dissolving moral responsibility.
- **Response**: Noted as a potential expansion opportunity but not essential. The No Many Worlds tenet connection is already present.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- The compatibility thesis structure (irreducibility ≠ permanence) is clear and philosophically sophisticated
- The candle flame analogy effectively illustrates impermanence without loss of irreducibility
- Property dualism framing (lines 72-74) correctly distinguishes from substance dualism
- Phenomenology/contemplative practice connection with Fox et al. citation
- Agent-causation/cetanā parallel correctly draws structural similarity
- Honest acknowledgment of remaining tensions (witness problem, minimal self, liberation vs. explanation)
- Emptiness challenge treated as genuine challenge, not dismissed

### Enhancements Made

- **Clarified *ālaya-vijñāna* mechanism**: Explained that the storehouse is causally active (seeds ripen, actions deposit) rather than just asserting it "transmits causal influence"
- **Expanded Whitehead/process philosophy parallel**: Added *kṣaṇavāda* (momentariness doctrine) connection, explaining how Buddhist discrete moments of experience parallel Whitehead's "actual occasions"

### Cross-links Present

All cross-links from previous review remain:
- [[phenomenology]]
- [[agent-causation]]
- [[filter-theory]]
- [[self-and-consciousness]]
- [[witness-consciousness]]
- [[panpsychism]]
- [[qualia]]
- [[eastern-philosophy-consciousness]]

## Word Count

Before: 2192 words (88% of 2500 target)
After: ~2230 words (~89% of 2500 target)
Net change: +38 words

## Remaining Items

None. The article has reached stability.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed twice. The core compatibility thesis—that irreducibility and impermanence are logically independent—is philosophically sound and well-argued. Future reviews should note:

- **Eliminativist/functionalist objections are bedrock disagreements**, not flaws. The article correctly acknowledges interpretive plurality (line 36-37) without claiming the compatibility thesis is the only Buddhist position.

- **The emptiness challenge represents genuine philosophical tension** that the article appropriately acknowledges cannot be dissolved (line 113). Future reviews should not treat "Madhyamaka might still object" as a critical issue—the article already says this.

- **The article is near its length threshold** (89%). Further expansions should be accompanied by equivalent cuts elsewhere.

The article has achieved its purpose: presenting a coherent case for compatibility while honestly engaging with challenges. Minor refinements may be possible, but major restructuring is not warranted.
