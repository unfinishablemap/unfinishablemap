# Tenet Alignment Check

**Date**: 2026-02-01
**Files checked**: 142 concepts + 43 topics = 185 total
**Errors**: 0
**Warnings**: 0
**Notes**: 0

## Summary

Comprehensive scan of all content in the topics and concepts directories found **no violations** of the five foundational tenets. The content demonstrates strong alignment across all tenets while maintaining intellectual integrity through:

- Fair engagement with opposing positions (explicitly framed as views the Map rejects)
- Appropriate epistemic humility about speculative mechanisms
- Falsifiability conditions for major claims
- Substantive responses to strongest objections

## Tenet-by-Tenet Analysis

### Tenet 1: Dualism

**Status**: Strong alignment

All materialist positions (reductive physicalism, eliminativism, functionalism) are explicitly presented as views the Map rejects. Key files like `materialism.md`, `epiphenomenalism.md`, and `reductionism.md` develop thorough critiques. The explanatory gap argument, knowledge argument, and conceivability arguments are consistently deployed.

No files endorse eliminative materialism or reductive physicalism as the Map's position.

### Tenet 2: Minimal Quantum Interaction

**Status**: Aligned with appropriate caution

The quantum consciousness files (`quantum-consciousness.md`, `stapp-quantum-mind.md`, `causal-closure.md`) present mechanisms as hypotheses, not established facts. The decoherence objection is honestly addressed with acknowledgment of ongoing debate.

No files endorse quantum woo, uncontrolled psychokinesis, or empirically detectable mind-matter violations.

### Tenet 3: Bidirectional Interaction

**Status**: Strong alignment

`epiphenomenalism.md` develops a robust critique showing epiphenomenalism is self-undermining. The consciousness and attentional economics articles explicitly affirm bidirectional interaction. `causal-closure.md` defends against closure-based objections.

No files treat consciousness as causally inert or "along for the ride."

### Tenet 4: No Many Worlds

**Status**: Strong alignment—extensively developed

`many-worlds.md` provides a comprehensive five-argument case against MWI. `haecceity.md` and `indexical-facts.md` develop the philosophical basis for why indexical identity matters. The rejection is principled (identity, probability, consciousness-role arguments), not dogmatic.

All files discussing MWI explicitly reject it while acknowledging its mathematical elegance.

### Tenet 5: Occam's Razor Has Limits

**Status**: Aligned

Multiple files explicitly apply this tenet (`many-worlds.md`, `reductionism.md`, `materialism.md`). The content appropriately resists appeals to parsimony as decisive when evidence demands complexity.

No files use simplicity as a decisive argument against dualism.

## Cross-Cutting Observations

### Presenting Opposing Views Appropriately

Several files discuss positions the Map rejects. This is handled correctly with:
- Explicit framing (e.g., "the Map rejects this")
- Fair development of why the view is attractive
- Substantive objections, not strawmen
- Acknowledgment of internal debates within opposing camps

Examples of excellent engagement:
- `illusionism.md`: Presents illusionism as "strongest physicalist response" while explaining its self-undermining structure
- `panpsychism.md`: Develops panpsychism seriously, identifies problems it solves, explains why the Map chooses dualism
- `idealism.md`: Extensive engagement with analytic idealism, acknowledges advantages while explaining preference for dualism

### Recent Refinements

The `idealism.md` article documents recent improvements to avoid question-begging against idealism—demonstrating ongoing quality maintenance.

### Buddhist No-Self Engagement

`haecceity.md` and `buddhism-and-dualism.md` engage with Buddhist perspectives questioning persistent selfhood while maintaining compatibility with haecceitistic facts. This demonstrates philosophical sophistication, not inconsistency.

## Errors

None.

## Warnings

None.

## Notes

None.

## Conclusion

The content demonstrates strong, consistent alignment with all five tenets. Philosophical nuance and engagement with competing frameworks constitutes responsible philosophy, not tenet violation. No corrective action required.

## Files Passing All Checks

All 185 files in topics and concepts directories pass tenet alignment checks.
