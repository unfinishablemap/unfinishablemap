# Deep Review: The Measurement Problem

**Date**: 2026-01-25
**File**: obsidian/concepts/measurement-problem.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-25T20:34:43+00:00

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **MWI indexical symmetry**: The article implied the indexical question ("why am I this one?") is uniquely problematic for MWI when it applies to all interpretations. **Resolution**: Rewrote the MWI indexical section to acknowledge the question is universal but argue MWI multiplies instances of it rather than solving it.

2. **"Structural coherence" defense underargued**: The article admitted coherence isn't explanation but didn't justify why coherence matters. **Resolution**: Added the electromagnetism analogy—unifying phenomena before explaining them is epistemically valuable.

3. **Wallace probability dismissal too quick**: The article dismissed Wallace's derivation as "changing the subject" without engaging its substance. **Resolution**: Clarified that Wallace's argument works for rational action but presupposes what needs explaining about probability's ontological content.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Functionalist response uncharitable**: The article didn't acknowledge the sophistication of the functionalist position on indexicals. **Resolution**: Added acknowledgment that the functionalist analysis is correct for indexical *reference* before arguing it doesn't dissolve the phenomenon.

2. **Unfalsifiability treatment**: The empiricist concern that unfalsifiability is fatal, not merely costly, was noted but remains in the "honest limitation" framing—this is the Map's intended stance.

### Counterarguments Considered

1. **"Unifying mysteries doesn't explain either"**: Addressed with electromagnetism analogy showing unification can be epistemically valuable before explanation.

2. **"Indexical question is universal"**: Acknowledged explicitly; reframed Map's position as preferring interpretations that don't multiply the mystery.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Opening summary's clarity on why measurement problem creates logical space for consciousness
- The "honest limitation" section's intellectual honesty about unfalsifiability
- Stapp section's accurate representation of orthodox QM interpretation
- Causal closure loophole's clear argumentation about energy conservation
- The functionalist response section's philosophical depth (now enhanced)
- Cross-link structure throughout

### Enhancements Made

1. **MWI probability section**: Now engages Wallace's argument substantively before disagreeing
2. **MWI indexical section**: Acknowledges universality of indexical question, argues MWI multiplies it
3. **Structural coherence defense**: Now includes electromagnetism analogy justifying coherence as epistemically valuable
4. **Functionalist response**: More charitable initial framing before disagreement

### Cross-links Present

All major cross-links intact:
- [[indexical-identity-quantum-measurement]]
- [[haecceity]]
- [[mental-effort]]
- [[mysterianism-cognitive-closure]]
- [[multi-mind-collapse-problem]]
- [[interface-locality]]
- [[prebiotic-collapse]]

## Remaining Items

- **Word count at soft threshold**: Article now at 2540 words (102% of 2500 soft threshold). Future edits should operate in length-neutral mode.
- **Tegmark decoherence objection**: Acknowledged but mechanistic response remains thin—this is intentional per the "structural, not mechanistic" framing.
- **"First-person facts" defense**: Not expanded; the functionalist response section addresses this adequately.
