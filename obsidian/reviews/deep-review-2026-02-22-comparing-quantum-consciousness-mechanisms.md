**Article**: [[comparing-quantum-consciousness-mechanisms|Comparing Quantum Consciousness Mechanisms]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-10-comparing-quantum-consciousness-mechanisms|2026-02-10]]

## Context

This review was conducted with specific attention to spontaneous collapse insights from the newly created [[philosophical-stakes-of-spontaneous-collapse]] article. The previous review (2026-02-10) addressed five critical citation errors and several medium issues. This review focuses on remaining citation gaps and integration with new site content.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **"Wiest et al. (2025)" should be "Wiest (2025)" (C1)**: The 2025 *Neuroscience of Consciousness* paper (niaf011) is single-authored by Michael C. Wiest. Confirmed via PubMed. **Resolution**: Changed to "Wiest (2025) reports" throughout.

2. **Missing Player & Hore reference (C2)**: Text cited "Player and Hore's upper bound of ~37 minutes" (Fisher section) but no reference entry existed. **Resolution**: Added Player, T. C. & Hore, P. J. (2018) to References.

3. **Missing epothilone B study citation (C3)**: Text referenced "The 2024 epothilone B study" without author attribution or reference entry. The paper is Khan et al. (2024) in *eNeuro*. **Resolution**: Added inline attribution "Khan et al. 2024" and full reference entry.

### Medium Issues Found

- **Missing tryptophan superradiance citation (M1)**: "Room-temperature tryptophan superradiance" lacked a citation. The paper is Babcock et al. (2024) in *J. Phys. Chem. B*. **Resolution**: Added inline attribution and full reference entry.

- **CSL-IIT section lacked mechanism specificity (M2)**: The section didn't mention that Φ_Max serves as the collapse operator. **Resolution**: Added sentence specifying McQueen's formulation with honest caveat that the coupling is "postulated, not derived from deeper principles."

- **Missing cross-link to philosophical-stakes-of-spontaneous-collapse (M3)**: New article (created 2026-02-22) is highly relevant. **Resolution**: Added to both related_articles frontmatter and Further Reading section.

- **~1000 observations figure lacks specific citation (M4, carried forward)**: From Stapp (2007) but page not specified. Deferred — the book citation exists; adding a page number would require accessing the physical text.

### Counterarguments Considered

- All six adversarial personas engaged; no new critical philosophical issues identified beyond bedrock disagreements (materialism as alternative, MWI viability, fixed-self assumption) already documented in previous review's stability notes.
- The Quantum Skeptic (Tegmark) perspective found the decoherence assessments fair and balanced.
- The Empiricist (Popper) perspective drove the citation fixes — empirical claims need proper sourcing.

## Attribution Accuracy Check

- **Misattribution**: Wiest et al. → Wiest (single author) — FIXED
- **Qualifier preservation**: All qualifiers intact ("over three orders of magnitude," "upper bound," "circumstantial support")
- **Position strength**: No overstated positions found
- **Source/Map separation**: Clean — opening paragraph disclaims dualist premise assumption
- **Self-contradiction**: None found

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- The five evaluation criteria systematically applied across all mechanisms
- "Theories of consciousness should explain what consciousness is like, not merely where it acts" — key philosophical sentence
- The comparative summary table — clean and informative
- The Stapp-CSL complementarity proposal — genuinely original
- The William James quotation — well-deployed
- The "Split" falsifiability assessment for CSL-IIT — intellectually honest
- The coupling-modes reference in Relation to Site Perspective

### Enhancements Made

- Added Φ_Max-as-operator detail to CSL-IIT section with honest caveat about postulated coupling
- Added cross-link to new philosophical-stakes-of-spontaneous-collapse article
- Fixed three critical citation errors (Wiest authorship, Player & Hore missing reference, Khan et al. missing reference)
- Added tryptophan superradiance citation (Babcock et al. 2024)

### Cross-links Added

- [[philosophical-stakes-of-spontaneous-collapse]]

## Word Count

2665 → 2817 (+152 words, 94% of 3000 soft threshold)

## Remaining Items

- The ~1000 observations figure in Stapp's section lacks a specific page citation from Stapp (2007)
- Process philosophy connection identified in previous review as expansion opportunity — still deferred
- The combination problem for IIT-based collapse models is worth noting in a future review

## Stability Notes

- Previous review's stability notes remain valid: adversarial philosopher disagreements with dualist framing are bedrock philosophical differences, not fixable flaws.
- The relative rating of Stapp vs CSL-IIT on tenet alignment remains "Strong" for both — this should not oscillate.
- This article is approaching stability. Two reviews have now addressed citation accuracy comprehensively. Future reviews should focus on substantive content changes (if any) rather than re-checking existing citations. If no modifications occur, the article should be considered stable.
