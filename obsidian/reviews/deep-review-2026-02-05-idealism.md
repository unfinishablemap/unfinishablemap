**Date**: 2026-02-05
**Article**: [[idealism|Idealism]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-30-idealism|2026-01-30]]

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article remains stable from the previous review.

### Medium Issues Found
None new. Previous review addressed all medium-priority concerns.

### Low Issues Found
- Removed outdated AI refinement log comment (per its instruction to remove after human review)

### Counterarguments Considered

All six adversarial personas applied. No new critical issues identified:

- **Eliminative Materialist (Churchland)**: Would reject the hard problem premise. This is the Map's starting point, not arguable within this article.
- **Hard-Nosed Physicalist (Dennett)**: Phenomenology of otherness is interpretable either way. Article already acknowledges this (lines 84-86).
- **Quantum Skeptic (Tegmark)**: Quantum mechanism already qualified with pointer to tenets page.
- **Many-Worlds Defender (Deutsch)**: Indexical argument remains unsatisfying to MWI proponents. Bedrock disagreement, not fixable flaw.
- **Empiricist (Popper)**: No issues—article acknowledges positions are wagers, not proofs.
- **Buddhist Philosopher (Nagarjuna)**: Eastern traditions acknowledged in opening paragraph.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Fair treatment of idealism's genuine advantages (parsimony, dissolving hard problem)
- Honest acknowledgment of slime mold challenge
- Strong indexical identity argument connected to agent causation
- Epistemologically humble conclusion ("The choice depends on how one weighs the various puzzles")
- Clear opening that front-loads the key difference from the Map's position
- Extensive cross-linking to related concepts

### Enhancements Made

1. **Removed AI refinement log** — The comment at the end of the article instructed removal after human review; cleaned up accordingly
2. **Orphan integration** — Added inbound links from 5 articles that mentioned idealism without linking:
   - `objectivity-and-consciousness.md` — Added `[[idealism|Idealism]]` link in "Why Not Idealism?" header
   - `panpsychism.md` — Added `[[idealism]]` to Further Reading section
   - `materialism.md` — Added `[[idealism]]` to Alternative Frameworks paragraph
   - `buddhism-and-dualism.md` — Added `[[idealism]]` link where idealism is mentioned
   - `eastern-philosophy-consciousness.md` — Added `[[idealism]]` link where "Western idealism" is mentioned

### Cross-links Added

From other articles TO `[[idealism]]`:
- [[objectivity-and-consciousness]]
- [[panpsychism]]
- [[materialism]]
- [[buddhism-and-dualism]]
- [[eastern-philosophy-consciousness]]

## Remaining Items

None. The article has been stable since the 2026-01-30 review. This review focused on orphan integration per task context.

## Stability Notes

This is the third deep review of this article. The article reached stability at the second review (2026-01-30). This review confirms that stability and addresses the orphan integration task—the article had no inbound links despite being a well-developed concept page.

Key philosophical disagreements noted (unchanged from previous review):
- **Eliminativists** will reject the hard problem premise — this is the Map's starting point, not arguable within this article
- **MWI defenders** will find the indexical argument unsatisfying — this reflects the No Many Worlds tenet
- **Quantum skeptics** have legitimate decoherence concerns — acknowledged with pointer to fuller treatment

Future reviews should not re-flag these as critical issues.

**Word count**: 2907 → 2861 (-46 words) — removed AI log comment; article remains at 114% of soft threshold, operating in length-neutral mode
