**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Buddhist philosophy mischaracterisation**: The article claimed Indian traditions "arrived at structurally similar conclusions," implying Buddhists confirmed an irreducible subject-object distinction. In fact, Buddhist meditative deconstruction leads to *anatman* (no-self)—the subject is *empty*, not irreducible. **Resolution**: Revised to accurately distinguish Buddhist conclusions from Advaita Vedanta's, noting the distinction remains phenomenologically inescapable even for traditions that deny the subject's ultimate reality. This actually strengthens the convergence argument.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Knowledge argument stated without responses**: The article presented Mary's Room as conclusive without acknowledging physicalist replies. **Resolution**: Added brief acknowledgment of the ability and acquaintance hypotheses, while noting both concede the phenomenological point.
- **Epiphenomenal wikilink misdirected**: `[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|epiphenomenal]]` linked "epiphenomenal" to the quantum interaction tenet rather than the epiphenomenalism concept. **Resolution**: Changed to `[[epiphenomenalism|epiphenomenal]]`.
- **Self-stultification argument unnamed**: The article made this argument ("could not produce the philosophical tradition that discovered it") without naming or cross-linking it. **Resolution**: Added wikilink to `[[self-stultification]]`.
- **Missing cross-links**: Several highly relevant articles were not linked. **Resolution**: Added objectivity-and-consciousness, self-stultification, philosophical-zombies, and the-convergence-argument-for-dualism to Further Reading.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist**: Claims the subject-object distinction is folk psychology. Article addresses this by arguing the distinction was discovered through systematic inquiry, not assumed.
- **Dennett's heterophenomenology**: Treats subjective reports as data without granting phenomenal reality. Article links to heterophenomenology in frontmatter; full engagement is appropriate for a separate article rather than here.
- **Buddhist no-self**: The strongest challenge to the convergence argument. Now addressed honestly—Buddhists find the phenomenon but conclude differently about its nature, which strengthens rather than weakens the case.
- **Physicalist responses to Mary**: Ability and acquaintance hypotheses. Now acknowledged, with the point that both concede the phenomenological asymmetry.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- The "discovery vs. construction" framing—philosophically original and well-argued
- Three-part "What Was Actually Discovered" structure—clear, progressive, and powerful
- Integration with the-unobservable-self—sharpens the subject's elusiveness
- Substantive Relation to Site Perspective connecting to all five tenets
- The epiphenomenalism/self-stultification argument—elegant and concise
- Confident prose voice aligned with the style guide
- Focused length—no bloat

### Enhancements Made
- Buddhist philosophy characterisation corrected and convergence argument strengthened
- Brief physicalist responses acknowledged for the knowledge argument
- Epiphenomenal wikilink corrected to point to the right concept
- Self-stultification argument explicitly named and cross-linked
- Four new articles added to Further Reading for richer navigation

### Cross-links Added
- [[epiphenomenalism]]
- [[self-stultification]]
- [[objectivity-and-consciousness]]
- [[philosophical-zombies]]
- [[the-convergence-argument-for-dualism]]

## Remaining Items

None. All critical and medium issues were addressed in this review.

## Stability Notes

- The six adversarial personas (especially the Buddhist philosopher) will always find tension with the article's dualist framing. The revised treatment of Buddhist *anatman* honestly acknowledges the metaphysical disagreement while defending the phenomenological convergence. Future reviews should not re-flag this as a problem unless new content introduces mischaracterisation.
- Eliminative materialists and heterophenomenologists will disagree with the article's central thesis that the subject-object distinction is a genuine discovery. This is a bedrock philosophical disagreement, not a flaw to fix.
