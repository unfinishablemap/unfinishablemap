# Deep Review: The Measurement Problem

**Date**: 2026-01-25
**File**: obsidian/concepts/measurement-problem.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-25T19:22:30+00:00
**Word count**: 2487 → 2502 (+15)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Wallace derivation dismissed too quickly**: The MWI section said Wallace's argument was "unsatisfying" without explaining why.
   - **Resolution**: Added clarification that decision theory shows how to act *given* probabilities but doesn't explain what probabilities *are*—it assumes branch-weights rather than deriving them.

2. **Functionalist indexical response was weak**: The original response ("denying first-person facts requires using them") was somewhat circular.
   - **Resolution**: Replaced with sharper argument: if "why am I this one?" is trivially semantic, so is "why does this hurt?"—but functionalists themselves distinguish genuine pain from pain-behavior, which requires taking first-person perspective seriously.

3. **"Structural not mechanistic" claim under-acknowledged as concession**: The retreat from mechanism to structure was presented as unproblematic.
   - **Resolution**: Made explicit this is "a significant concession" that makes the claim "philosophical rather than scientific."

### Medium Issues Addressed

- Trimmed verbose phrasing in haecceity section
- Tightened decoherence objection paragraph
- Consolidated mathematics discontinuity explanation

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Tegmark's decoherence objection**: Acknowledged as "severe" and potentially decisive. The article doesn't claim to refute it but clarifies what survives if mechanisms fail.
- **Wallace's decision-theoretic derivation**: Now engaged more substantively—the objection is that it presupposes branch-weights rather than deriving them.
- **Functionalist semantic analysis of indexicality**: Addressed with argument that functionalists themselves rely on first-person/third-person distinction when distinguishing genuine mental states from behavior.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Opening paragraph's connection between measurement problem and "logical opening for consciousness"
- The "honest limitation" paragraph demonstrating intellectual integrity
- Parallel structure between measurement problem and hard problem (both involving first-person facts)
- Multi-observer resolution through interface-locality
- Causal closure loophole section (well-structured, three clear features)
- All tenet connections in "Relation to Site Perspective"

### Enhancements Made

1. **Sharpened Wallace objection**: Now clearly distinguishes between decision theory (how to act) and probability interpretation (what probabilities are)
2. **Strengthened functionalist response**: New argument shows functionalists themselves rely on first-person/third-person distinction
3. **Clarified mechanistic concession**: Explicitly acknowledges the framework becomes "philosophical rather than scientific" without viable mechanism, while noting the structural point still stands

### Cross-links Present

Already extensively linked to relevant concepts:

- [[subjective-probability-quantum-measurement]]
- [[many-worlds]]

- All five tenets

## Remaining Items

None. All critical and medium issues addressed. Article remains at soft threshold (2502 words, 100% of 2500 target) through length-neutral editing.
