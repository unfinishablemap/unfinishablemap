# Deep Review: Ethics of Consciousness

**Date**: 2026-01-20
**File**: obsidian/topics/ethics-of-consciousness.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Missing illusionist engagement**: The article grounded ethics in phenomenal consciousness but didn't address the illusionist challenge that phenomenal properties might be illusory.
   - **Resolution**: Added comprehensive "The Illusionist Challenge" section with three responses (regress, performative contradiction, phenomenal value realism).

2. **Missing process philosophy perspective**: Pattern established in recent deep reviews; this philosophical lens was absent.
   - **Resolution**: Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section connecting Whitehead's actual occasions to ethics of consciousness.

3. **No falsifiability section**: Article made claims without specifying what would challenge them.
   - **Resolution**: Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section with five falsifiability conditions.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Buddhist ethics missing from convergence claim**: Article claimed traditions "disagreeing about almost everything else agree" on consciousness grounding ethics, but omitted Buddhism.
   - **Resolution**: Added Buddhist ethics paragraph with ahimsa, dukkha, and Jataka tales.

2. **Vegetative state claim needed citation**: "Up to 25% show covert awareness" was unsupported.
   - **Resolution**: Added Owen et al. (2006) and Kondziella et al. (2020) citations with specific percentages (15-20%).

3. **Tenet section too brief**: Five tenets mentioned but not substantively developed.
   - **Resolution**: Expanded each tenet connection with multiple bullet points explaining specific ethical implications.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Illusionism** (Dennett, Frankish): If phenomenal consciousness is illusory, consciousness-based ethics loses its foundation.
  - Addressed with three responses in new section.

- **Decoherence objection**: Quantum mechanisms for consciousness can't work in warm biological systems.
  - Addressed in expanded Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet section with reference to quantum-biology.

- **Process philosophy challenge**: Whitehead's view implies proto-consciousness "all the way down."
  - Engaged constructively—process philosophy supports graduated moral status while explaining why AI may lack genuine occasions.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Strong opening summary that survives truncation
- Comprehensive treatment of moral patienthood categories (likely conscious, probably not, uncertain)
- Well-developed weighted consideration framework for moral uncertainty
- Excellent pain asymbolia example demonstrating nociception-suffering dissociation
- Thorough treatment of copying/uploading implications under indexical identity
- Philosophical Vulcan thought experiment effectively deployed
- Agent causation section connecting consciousness to moral responsibility

### Enhancements Made

1. Added Buddhist ethics to philosophical convergence section
2. Added vegetative state citations (Owen, Kondziella)
3. Created "The Illusionist Challenge" section with three responses
4. Created "Process Philosophy Perspective" section connecting Whitehead to ethics
5. Created "What Would Challenge This View?" falsifiability section
6. Expanded all five tenet connections with substantive ethical implications
7. Added 5 new cross-links to frontmatter
8. Added 6 new references
