**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Article**: [[phenomenology-of-the-edge|The Phenomenology of the Edge]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-03b-phenomenology-of-the-edge|2026-02-03]]
**Context**: Cross-review considering probability-intuition insights (follow-up)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. Article remains stable after three previous reviews.

### Medium Issues Found
None requiring action. Previously identified issues remain deferred due to word count constraints:
- Empiricist falsifiability point (would expand article beyond soft threshold)
- Nagarjuna reification concern (philosophical disagreement, not error)

### Attribution Accuracy Check
All six checks passed:
- Misattribution: None found (James, Metzinger, Millière, Kriegel, McGinn accurately cited)
- Qualifier preservation: Intact
- Position strength: Appropriately hedged throughout
- Source/Map separation: Clear
- Self-contradiction: None

### Counterarguments Considered
All six adversarial personas engaged:
1. **Eliminative materialist**: Edge-clarity could be low-noise brain states. Bedrock disagreement; article addresses with "specificity is data" argument.
2. **Heterophenomenologist**: Zero-person reports are still reports. Noted in previous reviews; addressed in witness-consciousness article.
3. **Quantum skeptic**: Filter theory lacks mechanism. Article correctly frames as Map's position, not established science.
4. **MWI defender**: Edge-experiences could be decoherence effects. Tenet-level disagreement.
5. **Empiricist**: Falsifiability unclear. Deferred—would require word count increase.
6. **Buddhist philosopher**: Risks reifying consciousness. Philosophical difference from Map's dualist framework.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
All major strengths remain:
- Opening summary (front-loaded, truncation-resilient)
- Edge-experience profile table (organizes complex material)
- Dissolving-insight phenomenon (distinctive contribution)
- Upper/lower edge convergence insight
- Tenet connections across all five tenets
- Cross-method convergence argument
- Kriegel's representational/psychological closure distinction

### Cross-Review Assessment: Probability-Intuition Insights
The previous review (2026-02-03b) already integrated probability-intuition-void:
- Added to related_articles
- Mentioned "probability-boundary" in "Multiple edges exist" section
- Added to Further Reading

Additional phenomenological parallels exist (intuition-knowledge split, absent qualia of probability) but would require expansion beyond soft threshold. Integration is complete at appropriate level.

### Enhancements Made
None. Article content unchanged; only timestamps updated.

## Remaining Items

None. Article has reached convergence after four deep reviews.

## Word Count

2191 words (110% of 2000 soft threshold) - unchanged

## Stability Notes

This is the fourth deep review in a single day. The article has reached high stability:
- Core phenomenological framework is solid
- Tenet connections are substantive
- Cross-linking is comprehensive
- Attribution accuracy verified
- No philosophical disagreements flagged as critical (adversarial personas' objections are bedrock disagreements, not fixable flaws)
- Word count at 110% of soft threshold—no room for expansion

**Convergence achieved.** Future reviews should:
- NOT expand content unless article is substantively modified
- NOT re-flag adversarial persona objections as critical
- ONLY review if new related content requires cross-linking
- Consider this article stable until human modification or significant new voids content
