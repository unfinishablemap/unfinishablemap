# Deep Review: The Measurement Problem

**Date**: 2026-01-25
**File**: obsidian/concepts/measurement-problem.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-25T18:42:18+00:00
**Word count**: 2481 → 2482 (+1 word)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Functionalism misrepresentation (fixed)**: The original text suggested zombie arguments "become relevant" if functionalism is accepted—but zombie arguments are designed to *attack* functionalism. The logic was inverted.
   - **Resolution**: Rewrote to correctly frame the dialectic: zombie arguments challenge functionalism's claim that function entails phenomenology; Dennett rejects the conceivability premise; this is a bedrock disagreement.

2. **MWI self-locating uncertainty treatment (fixed)**: The original objection ("all copies will exist") didn't engage the strongest MWI response—that uncertainty is about the tensed future from one's current perspective.
   - **Resolution**: Added the strongest MWI response (tensed uncertainty compatible with all futures existing) before presenting the Map's counter about phenomenological singularity.

### Medium Issues Found

3. **Energy conservation claim needed grounding (fixed)**: "Selecting among equi-energetic outcomes doesn't require adding energy" was asserted without explanation.
   - **Resolution**: Added clarification that if consciousness merely biases *which* outcome occurs among energetically equivalent possibilities, conservation laws remain satisfied.

4. **Hidden variables caveat (fixed)**: The claim that physics "leaves outcomes undetermined" is interpretation-dependent.
   - **Resolution**: Explicitly noted that hidden-variables interpretations (like Bohmian mechanics) and superdeterminism contest this, and that these interpretations eliminate the causal opening the Map exploits.

### Counterarguments Considered

1. **Functionalist conceivability objection**: Now explicitly addressed—Dennett rejects that we can conceive zombies clearly enough to establish metaphysical possibility.

2. **MWI tensed uncertainty response**: Now explicitly addressed—uncertainty about the tensed future is compatible with all futures existing.

3. **Mechanism objection** (deferred): The article already acknowledges this via "Honest limitation" paragraph and Tegmark decoherence section.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Opening paragraphs (framing + honest limitation) retained
- Indexical dimension section structure unchanged
- Multi-observer coordination problem resolution unchanged
- Causal closure loophole section enhanced but core preserved
- "Relation to Site Perspective" section unchanged

### Enhancements Made

1. Corrected logical structure of functionalism/zombie argument dialectic
2. Strengthened engagement with MWI by presenting strongest response before counter
3. Added physical grounding for energy conservation claim
4. Clarified interpretation-dependence of indeterminacy claim
5. Tightened Wallace MWI discussion to maintain length neutrality

### Cross-links Added

None needed—article already well-linked.

## Remaining Items

- **Empiricist concern (unfalsifiability)**: The article's honest limitation paragraph already acknowledges this directly. The position is defended as philosophical framework rather than scientific hypothesis, which is the appropriate response.

- **Mechanism concern (what physically constitutes observation events?)**: This is acknowledged in the Stapp section and flagged as a substantial challenge. The article's position ("the philosophical opening survives") is maintained as the appropriate stance given current evidence.

These are not deferrals but reasoned positions—further work would change the article's stance rather than improve its execution.
