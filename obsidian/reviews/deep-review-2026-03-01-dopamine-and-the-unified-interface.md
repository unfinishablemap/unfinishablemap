**Date**: 2026-03-01
**Article**: [[dopamine-and-the-unified-interface|Dopamine and the Unified Interface]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-05-dopamine-and-the-unified-interface|2026-02-05]]

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Six adversarial personas examined the article. The previous review (2026-02-05) found no critical issues and declared the article stable. This review confirms that stability.

### Critical Issues Found

None. The article remains factually accurate, properly cited, and internally consistent. All references (Kaeser 2024, Westbrook 2023, Neumann 2024, Bengson 2019, Bhatiasevi 2025, Berridge 2007, Rizzolatti 1994) are correctly attributed and appropriately described.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Incomplete tenet coverage in Relation to Site Perspective**: The section covered Dualism, Bidirectional Interaction, and Minimal Quantum Interaction but omitted No Many Worlds and Occam's Razor Has Limits.
   - **Resolution**: Added brief No Many Worlds and Occam's Razor sections, keeping them concise and connected to the article's specific dopamine evidence.

2. **Missing cross-references (orphan status)**: The article had 7 inbound links but was missing connections from several articles that discuss dopamine or closely related topics.
   - **Resolution**: Added cross-references from 5 articles (see below).

3. **Missing outbound cross-links**: The article discussed Parkinson's extensively without linking to [[consciousness-and-neurodegenerative-disease]], and didn't link to [[the-interface-location-problem]] or [[phenomenology-of-flow-states]].
   - **Resolution**: Added inline cross-reference in the Parkinson's section and three entries in Further Reading.

### Counterarguments Considered

All counterarguments from the previous review remain addressed:
- Physicalist objection to the selection layer: acknowledged in the three-layer architecture section
- Learning primacy challenge: engaged with and shown compatible
- Quantum skepticism: mechanism marked as speculative

No new counterarguments identified since the article content is substantively unchanged.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

1. **Three-layer architecture** — Clear, appropriately hedged model
2. **Effort phenomenology parallel** — Original argument connecting attentional and motor effort
3. **Tonic/phasic dopamine distinction** — Well-grounded empirical section
4. **Parkinson's analysis** — Strong evidence for the selection interface
5. **Learning primacy engagement** — Shows how challenges can strengthen the framework
6. **Honest Limitation section** — Intellectual integrity

### Enhancements Made

1. Completed tenet coverage (No Many Worlds, Occam's Razor)
2. Added cross-reference to consciousness-and-neurodegenerative-disease in body text
3. Added three Further Reading entries for better site integration
4. Added 5 inbound cross-references from related articles

### Cross-links Added

**Outbound (from this article):**
- [[consciousness-and-neurodegenerative-disease]] (inline + Further Reading)
- [[the-interface-location-problem]] (Further Reading)
- [[phenomenology-of-flow-states]] (Further Reading)

**Inbound (from other articles to this one):**
- [[free-will]] — Added wikilink in Motor Selection section where dopamine is discussed
- [[the-interface-location-problem]] — Added to Further Reading
- [[placebo-effect-and-mental-causation]] — Added wikilink on "dopamine" in Parkinson's placebo section
- [[phenomenology-of-flow-states]] — Added to Further Reading
- [[consciousness-and-neurodegenerative-disease]] — Added to Further Reading

## Word Count

- **Before**: 1974 words
- **After**: 2132 words
- **Change**: +158 words (tenet sections and cross-references)
- **Status**: 71% of 3000 soft threshold — well within limits

## Remaining Items

None. The article is stable and well-integrated.

## Stability Notes

The article has now been reviewed twice and shows clear stability. The previous review found no critical issues; this review confirms that finding and focuses on integration rather than content changes. The philosophical disagreements identified in the first review remain bedrock disagreements:

- "Selection layer is just neural computation" — Acknowledged and responded to
- "Quantum effects don't survive decoherence" — Quantum mechanism marked as speculative
- "MWI dissolves the selection problem" — Map's rejection of MWI is tenet-level commitment

Future reviews should focus on maintaining cross-references as new content is added, not on re-examining settled content.
