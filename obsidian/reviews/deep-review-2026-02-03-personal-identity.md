**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Article**: [[personal-identity|Personal Identity]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-30-personal-identity|2026-01-30]]
**Context**: Cross-review personal-identity.md considering dreamless-sleep-void insights

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The article has reached stability through previous reviews.

### Medium Issues Found

**Dreamless sleep gap not addressed** (resolved): The article claimed consciousness persistence is central to identity but did not engage with the challenge from dreamless sleep discontinuity. The dreamless-sleep-void article directly raises the Lockean puzzle that if consciousness ceases during sleep, the person who wakes may not be the same who slept.

**Resolution**: Added "The Dreamless Sleep Challenge" subsection addressing this gap, drawing on the Vedantic analysis from dreamless-sleep-void that consciousness may persist as witness-awareness stripped of content.

**Missing cross-link** (resolved): Added [[dreamless-sleep-void]] to frontmatter and Further Reading.

### Low Issues Found

None new.

### Counterarguments Considered

The Dennett persona raised the strongest challenge: if consciousness can gap during sleep, what exactly persists? The added section addresses this by arguing the memory gap need not imply a consciousness gap—the ego that would encode memories may be absent while awareness persists.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

1. Excellent opening summary front-loading the key claim
2. Strong "Arguing for Haecceity" section with four distinct arguments
3. Past-self argument integration from previous review
4. Comprehensive falsification conditions in "What Would Challenge This View"
5. Thorough tenet connections in Relation to Site Perspective

### Enhancements Made

1. **Added dreamless sleep section**: New subsection "The Dreamless Sleep Challenge" addresses consciousness continuity through sleep
2. **Cross-links added**: [[dreamless-sleep-void]] in frontmatter, inline, and Further Reading
3. **Prose tightening**: Trimmed verbose passages throughout to maintain length neutrality

### Cross-links Added

- [[dreamless-sleep-void]] (frontmatter, inline, Further Reading)

## Changes Summary

This cross-review integrated dreamless-sleep-void insights:

1. **New subsection**: "The Dreamless Sleep Challenge" addresses the Lockean puzzle
2. **Vedantic response**: Consciousness may persist as witness-awareness through sleep
3. **Cross-linking**: Bidirectional connection established
4. **Word count**: 3025 → 3061 words (+36, near length-neutral)

The integration strengthens the personal-identity article by addressing a gap in its treatment of consciousness continuity.

## Remaining Items

None requiring immediate action.

## Stability Notes

This article remains stable. The previous review (2026-01-30) already marked it stable after past-self-void integration. This review adds one targeted enhancement (dreamless-sleep connection) rather than fundamental changes.

Future reviews should NOT:
- Re-flag the memory description—correctly aligned with past-self-void
- Re-flag dreamless sleep—now addressed with Vedantic response
- Re-litigate philosophical disagreements (MWI, illusionism, Buddhist anatta)
- Expand significantly—article is at ~102% of word count target

The article now addresses both temporal voids relevant to personal identity (past-self-void for memory reconstruction, dreamless-sleep-void for consciousness gaps).
