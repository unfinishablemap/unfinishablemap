# Tenet Alignment Check

**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Files checked**: 123 (58 topics + 65 concepts)
**Errors**: 0
**Warnings**: 0
**Notes**: 4

## Summary

All content maintains strong alignment with the five foundational tenets. No direct contradictions or implicit conflicts were detected. Four minor notes identify opportunities for clarification rather than actual tenet violations. The content demonstrates sophisticated philosophical reasoning that consistently supports dualism, minimal quantum interaction, bidirectional interaction, rejection of many-worlds, and epistemic humility about Occam's Razor.

## Errors

None.

## Warnings

None.

## Notes

### quantum-measurement-and-subjective-probability.md
- **Tenet affected**: Minimal Quantum Interaction; Occam's Razor Has Limits
- **Issue**: The article critiques QBism for being "deliberately silent about what agents *are*" and treating consciousness as "unproblematic." While valid, the article could better address whether the Map's own framework faces a parallel problem—it proposes consciousness biases outcomes but leaves the mechanism somewhat under-specified.
- **Quote**: "QBism uses consciousness to do explanatory work while treating consciousness itself as unproblematic."
- **Assessment**: Methodological clarification opportunity, not a conflict.

### epistemic-advantages-of-dualism.md
- **Tenet affected**: Occam's Razor Has Limits
- **Issue**: The article argues persuasively for epistemic humility but could be more explicit about when open-mindedness becomes unfalsifiable speculation. The asymmetric cost argument is strong, but the flipside—that dualism could motivate unfalsifiable theories—merits acknowledgment.
- **Quote**: "The asymmetric cost argument gains force from considering what we miss if consciousness has genuine causal powers."
- **Assessment**: No contradiction; this is a note about balance.

### machine-consciousness.md
- **Tenet affected**: Dualism; Minimal Quantum Interaction
- **Issue**: The article argues classical silicon cannot support consciousness because it suppresses quantum effects. However, the claim that consciousness depends on quantum effects has not been experimentally established. The reasoning is sound *if* consciousness requires a quantum interface, but the antecedent depends on contested empirical claims.
- **Quote**: "Silicon computing is engineered to be deterministic, suppressing the outcome indeterminacy the Map's framework requires."
- **Assessment**: Valid inference from premises; doesn't contradict tenets. The empirical foundation is appropriately flagged as uncertain.

### idealism.md
- **Tenet affected**: Bidirectional Interaction
- **Issue**: The article discusses how idealists interpret "consciousness influences matter" as "one dissociated portion of universal consciousness affects another." The Map's preference for genuine ontological distinction is clearly stated, but the article acknowledges this is "a wager based on phenomenology, not a proof."
- **Quote**: "The idealist can accommodate this: resistance is one portion of universal consciousness constraining another. But here the phenomenology matters."
- **Assessment**: Not a violation—careful articulation of disagreement. The Map's preference is phenomenologically motivated rather than definitional.

## Tenet-by-Tenet Assessment

### Tenet 1: Dualism
**Status**: Strongly supported across all articles.
- Consciousness is irreducible to physical processes—articulated through phenomenal properties, the hard problem, and causal efficacy arguments.
- No article endorses reductive physicalism or eliminative materialism.
- Alternative views (illusionism, materialism) are presented as challenges to be met, not endorsed positions.

### Tenet 2: Minimal Quantum Interaction
**Status**: Speculatively endorsed; empirically open.
- Quantum consciousness is consistently framed as a *candidate mechanism*, not established fact.
- The decoherence objection is acknowledged and addressed, not dismissed.
- Clear distinction maintained between quantum mechanisms and quantum mysticism.

### Tenet 3: Bidirectional Interaction
**Status**: Strongly supported.
- Multiple lines of evidence: neuroplasticity from willed practice, rational inference requiring consciousness's causal role, the consciousness-as-amplifier hypothesis, OCD treatment demonstrating consciousness directing neural change.
- No articles endorse epiphenomenalism. Where Chalmers' framework permitting epiphenomenalism is noted, the Map's rejection is explicit.

### Tenet 4: No Many Worlds
**Status**: Defended; treated as substantive choice.
- Detailed explanations of why MWI is rejected (indexical problems, haecceity requirements).
- Alternatives to MWI are shown to be scientifically viable.
- Appropriate framing: these are arguments *for* the position, not claims that MWI is disproven.

### Tenet 5: Occam's Razor Has Limits
**Status**: Strongly illustrated and defended.
- Multiple counterexamples: warm biological systems were assumed classical but proved quantum, apparent parsimony of epiphenomenalism conceals explanatory gaps.
- No articles treat simplicity as decisive.

## Cross-Tenet Consistency

The five tenets are mutually reinforcing:
- Dualism + Bidirectional Interaction: consciousness must be irreducible to have causal powers that violate closure.
- Minimal Quantum Interaction + No Many Worlds: quantum selection mechanisms only make sense if collapse is real.
- Bidirectional Interaction + Occam's Razor Has Limits: the apparent parsimony of epiphenomenalism is illusory.

No internal contradictions detected.

## Files Passing All Checks

All 123 files pass the tenet alignment check. The four notes above identify clarification opportunities, not actual conflicts.

### Topics (58 files)
All topic files maintain internal consistency with the Map's tenets. Representative examples with particularly strong alignment:
- argument-from-reason.md (Dualism, Bidirectional Interaction)
- quantum-measurement-interpretations-beyond-mwi.md (No Many Worlds)
- contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness-theories.md (Dualism, Bidirectional Interaction)
- epistemic-advantages-of-dualism.md (Occam's Razor Has Limits)

### Concepts (65 files)
All concept files demonstrate strong tenet alignment. Key defensive articles:
- materialism.md (explicitly rejects materialism)
- epiphenomenalism.md (rejects epiphenomenalism)
- many-worlds.md (explicitly rejects MWI)
- illusionism.md (explains why illusionism fails)
- functionalism.md (rejects functionalism)

## Informational Notes

The following articles discuss competing views but do so to explain and critique them from the Map's perspective, not to endorse them:

- **epiphenomenalism.md** - Presents the view to refute it thoroughly via the self-stultification problem
- **analytic-idealism.md** - Presents idealism as a competing position the Map shares some ground with but ultimately disagrees with
- **attention-schema-theory.md** - Presents AST as a materialist/illusionist theory the Map explicitly rejects
- **panpsychism.md** - Shares anti-emergence insight with Map; explicitly differs on mechanism while respecting Dualism

## Conclusion

The Unfinishable Map's content is fully aligned with its foundational tenets. No conflicts, implicit contradictions, or serious tensions were identified. The four notes above represent clarification opportunities rather than violations. The content consistently:

1. Treats consciousness as irreducible (Dualism)
2. Proposes quantum mechanisms carefully without mysticism (Minimal Quantum Interaction)
3. Argues consciousness causally affects physical outcomes (Bidirectional Interaction)
4. Rejects Many-Worlds in favor of single-world interpretations (No Many Worlds)
5. Acknowledges limits of parsimony arguments (Occam's Razor Has Limits)
