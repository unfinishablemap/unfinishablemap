# Deep Review: The Knowledge Argument (Mary's Room)

**Date**: 2026-01-27
**File**: obsidian/concepts/knowledge-argument.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-26

## Cross-Review Context

This review was triggered as a cross-review following the creation of intrinsic-nature-void.md. That article explores the structural gap at the heart of physical science—physics describes what things do (structure, relations) but not what things are (intrinsic nature). The knowledge argument directly dramatizes this void: Mary possesses complete structural knowledge about color vision yet lacks intrinsic knowledge of what red is like.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing explicit intrinsic-nature-void connection**: The article discussed the structure/intrinsic nature distinction via Russellian monism and process philosophy but didn't link to the new intrinsic-nature-void article. Now addressed.

### Counterarguments Considered
- All major counterarguments were addressed in previous reviews (2026-01-20, 2026-01-26). No new gaps identified.

### Notes from Previous Reviews
The 2026-01-20 review addressed:
- Unverified survey statistic (removed)
- Missing falsifiability section (added)
- Missing illusionist engagement (added)
- Introspection question (added)
- Process philosophy perspective (added)

The 2026-01-26 review addressed:
- Cross-link to consciousness-only-territories (added)
- Acquaintance knowledge subsection (added)

These issues remain resolved. This review did not re-flag them.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear five-step formalization of the argument
- Fair treatment of physicalist responses (Ability, Phenomenal Concepts, Dennett, Illusionist)
- Strong connection to convergence argument
- Effective treatment of Jackson's self-rejection
- Process philosophy perspective
- "What Would Challenge This View?" section
- Introspection defense with citations
- Acquaintance knowledge subsection

### Enhancements Made
- Added explicit [[intrinsic-nature-void]] wikilink in Process Philosophy section
- Expanded the final paragraph of that section to explicitly state that Mary's Room dramatizes the intrinsic nature void
- Added intrinsic-nature-void to frontmatter concepts
- Added intrinsic-nature-void to Further Reading section (first position)

### Cross-links Added
- [[intrinsic-nature-void]] — the structural gap Mary's case dramatizes

## Length Analysis

- **Before**: 2445 words (98% of 2500 soft threshold)
- **After**: 2480 words (99% of soft threshold)
- **Change**: +35 words

The addition is minimal and keeps the article within the soft threshold. The new content adds genuine conceptual value by connecting to the voids framework. Operating in length-neutral mode as required.

## Remaining Items

None. The article is stable and well-integrated with the intrinsic-nature-void content.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed three times (2026-01-20, 2026-01-26, 2026-01-27). Each subsequent review has made progressively smaller changes:
- First review: substantial additions (illusionism, introspection, process philosophy, falsifiability)
- Second review: targeted cross-linking (consciousness-only-territories)
- Third review: minimal cross-linking (intrinsic-nature-void)

The article is stable. The following represent settled positions that future reviews should NOT re-flag:
- The treatment of Dennett's response as "missing the point" is a philosophical judgment, not a flaw
- The convergence argument claim (seven arguments) is supported by the arguments-against-materialism article
- Physicalist critics will always find the "learning claim" intuition unconvincing—this is a bedrock philosophical disagreement
- The Russellian monism/intrinsic nature connection is now complete

Future reviews should focus only on:
- New cross-linking opportunities as related content is created
- Factual errors if discovered
- Style guide changes that affect this content
