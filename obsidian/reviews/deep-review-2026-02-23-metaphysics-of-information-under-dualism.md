**Date**: 2026-02-23
**Article**: [[metaphysics-of-information-under-dualism|The Metaphysics of Information Under Dualism]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article's attributions are accurate (Shannon 1948, Landauer 1961, Chalmers's double-aspect theory, Zheng & Meister 2025 all verified), there are no internal contradictions, and all required sections are present and substantive.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Inconsistent wikilink format**: `[[concepts/functionalism|organisational invariance]]` used path prefix while all other links used plain slugs → Fixed to `[[functionalism|organisational invariance]]`
- **Decoherence challenge unaddressed in causal exclusion section**: Article claimed consciousness acts at quantum indeterminacies and protested this isn't god-of-the-gaps, but didn't mention the standard decoherence objection → Added brief acknowledgment with cross-links to [[decoherence]] and [[consciousness-and-causal-powers]]
- **"10 bits per second" claim underexplained**: Cited as "empirical constraint" without explaining what it means for the framework → Added context about the contrast with 10 billion bits/s sensory processing, framing consciousness as a narrow semantic bottleneck
- **Missing cross-links**: No connection to [[attention-as-causal-bridge]] (the mechanism article) or [[consciousness-and-causal-powers]] (the causal framework) → Added inline references and Further Reading entries

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Dennett's functionalist objection** (understanding IS complex information processing): The article's thermostat argument addresses this but is stated rather than argued. Left as-is—the hard problem article develops this argument in full, and this article's scope is information's ontological status, not a full defence against functionalism.
- **Decoherence challenge** (quantum coherence destroyed too rapidly in warm brains): Added brief acknowledgment distinguishing basis selection (where decoherence operates) from outcome selection (where consciousness may operate).
- **Lack of empirical testability** (no experiment distinguishes "information as interface medium" from "information is physical"): This is a genuine limitation of the metaphysical framework. Not addressed because it applies to all four options equally and is acknowledged elsewhere in the Map's methodology articles.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- **Opening paragraph**: Excellent front-loading of the core question—if dualism is true, information occupies an awkward position between physical patterns and experiential content
- **Four-option framework**: Clear, fair taxonomy that treats each option's advantages and difficulties honestly before settling on the Map's position
- **Translator analogy**: "Just as a translator is neither French nor English but operates in both languages, information operates across the mind-matter boundary without belonging exclusively to either side"—praised in the same-day optimistic review as philosophically precise without sacrificing accessibility
- **Syntax-semantics divide section**: The article's strongest philosophical contribution—physical information is syntactic, consciousness supplies semantics, and this division motivates consciousness's causal role
- **Epistemic vs. ontological indeterminacy distinction**: Crucial philosophical point well-made in the causal exclusion section
- **"What Information Cannot Be Under Dualism" section**: Three clean constraints (not substrate-independent, not identical to consciousness, not ontologically fundamental in a unity-dissolving way)
- **Tenet-by-tenet connections**: All five tenets addressed substantively with specific informational consequences

### Enhancements Made
- Added decoherence acknowledgment with distinction between basis selection and outcome selection
- Expanded the 10 bits/s finding to explain its implications (narrow semantic bottleneck vs. high-throughput sensory processing)
- Added cross-link to [[attention-as-causal-bridge]] where the selection mechanism is developed
- Added cross-link to [[consciousness-and-causal-powers]] for the detailed causal framework
- Added [[decoherence]] and [[attention-as-causal-bridge]] to Further Reading

### Cross-links Added
- [[attention-as-causal-bridge]] (inline in causal exclusion section + Further Reading)
- [[consciousness-and-causal-powers]] (inline in causal exclusion section)
- [[decoherence]] (inline in causal exclusion section + Further Reading)

## Remaining Items

None. The article is well-constructed and the improvements are targeted refinements rather than structural changes.

## Stability Notes

The six adversarial personas raise predictable philosophical objections: eliminative materialists reject the premise (dualism); functionalists dispute the syntax-semantics gap; quantum skeptics challenge the mechanism; MWI defenders reject collapse. These are bedrock disagreements with the Map's tenets, not article-specific flaws. Future reviews should not re-flag "persona X disagrees with the dualist framework" as critical—the article's job is to develop the information metaphysics *under* dualism, not to defend dualism itself (which is handled elsewhere).

The decoherence challenge is now acknowledged and cross-referenced. If a future review finds this acknowledgment insufficient, the appropriate response is to develop the decoherence article further, not to expand this article's treatment of an issue better handled in its dedicated article.
