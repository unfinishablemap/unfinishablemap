**Date**: 2026-02-23
**Article**: [[control-theoretic-will|Control-Theoretic Will]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-22-control-theoretic-will|2026-02-22]]

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Broken wikilinks**: `[[psychophysical-coupling]]` referenced 3 times (frontmatter, Open Questions, Further Reading) but no article with that filename exists. Only research notes exist. **Resolution**: Replaced all instances with `[[the-psychophysical-control-law]]`, which is the actual article covering this subject.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Uncited central empirical claim**: The ~10 bits/second bandwidth figure appeared 4 times without inline citation. Meister (2024) was in references but never connected to this claim. **Resolution**: Added inline citations for Meister (2024) and Cisek (2007) in the opening summary where these claims first appear.
- **Quantum Zeno overemphasis in Stabilisation**: The section opened with "Through the proposed quantum Zeno mechanism," structuring the argument around a specific speculative mechanism contrary to the writing style guide's restraint requirement. **Resolution**: Restructured to lead with the control-theoretic operation (regulation), mentioning quantum Zeno as one candidate mechanism with inline Stapp (2007) citation.
- **Uncited references**: Cisek (2007), Wiener (1948), and Stapp (2007) were in references but never cited inline. **Resolution**: Added inline citations for all three — Cisek for competing action plans, Wiener for control theory introduction, Stapp for quantum Zeno candidate mechanism.

### Counterarguments Considered
- All six adversarial personas engaged. No new substantive concerns beyond what the previous review identified and the article already addresses. The "Analogy, Model, and Ontology" section continues to handle the physicalist/functionalist objections with intellectual honesty.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- "Analogy, Model, and Ontology" section — outstanding model for handling framework-vs-ontology distinctions
- Five control operations taxonomy — concrete, actionable content
- Bandwidth-as-design-feature reframing (thermostat, pilot analogies)
- Opening summary front-loading — excellent truncation resilience
- Mapping table — clear reference
- Phenomenological grounding ("feels like holding something in place against forces pulling it away")
- "You decide *what* to do, not *how* to do it" — novel articulation of coarse-grained conscious will
- "What Control-Theoretic Will Is Not" — clear boundary-drawing
- Attribution accuracy — all cited claims verified correct

### Enhancements Made
- Fixed 3 broken `[[psychophysical-coupling]]` wikilinks → `[[the-psychophysical-control-law]]`
- Added inline citations: Cisek (2007), Meister (2024), Wiener (1948), Stapp (2007)
- Restructured Stabilisation section to lead with control-theoretic operation, not speculative mechanism

### Cross-links Added
- [[the-psychophysical-control-law]] (replacing broken psychophysical-coupling links)

## Remaining Items

- The AI refinement log HTML comment (lines 171-182) notes "should be removed after human review." Left in place as no human review has occurred.
- Cisek (2007), Meister (2024), and Wiener (1948) now have inline citations. No uncited references remain in the reference list beyond background function.

## Stability Notes

- **MWI philosophical standoff**: Unchanged from previous review. Bedrock disagreement, not a flaw.
- **Physicalist adoption**: Unchanged. The "Analogy, Model, and Ontology" section handles this honestly. Not to be re-flagged.
- **Quantum mechanism speculation**: Now improved — the Stabilisation section no longer centers the quantum Zeno effect, instead presenting it as one candidate mechanism. The article's treatment of speculative mechanisms is now consistent with the writing style guide's restraint requirements.
- **Article approaching stability**: This is the second review. The article had one critical issue (broken links) and several medium issues (citation gaps, style guide compliance), all now resolved. Core content and argumentation remain strong. Unless substantive new content is added, future reviews should find diminishing returns.
