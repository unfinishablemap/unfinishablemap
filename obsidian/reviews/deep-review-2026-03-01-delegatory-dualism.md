**Date**: 2026-03-01
**Article**: [[delegatory-dualism|Delegatory Dualism]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-29b-delegatory-dualism|2026-01-29 (second pass)]]
**Context**: Cross-review considering entanglement-binding-hypothesis insights

## Review Context

This is the third deep review of this article, triggered as a cross-review after the new [[entanglement-binding-hypothesis]] article was published. The article was previously reviewed twice on 2026-01-29 and declared near-stable. An outer review by ChatGPT 5.2 Pro identified attribution issues that were subsequently fixed (Part I/Part II restructuring, verbatim quotes added, testability claims corrected, source/Map separation improved).

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. Attribution is accurate, source/Map separation is clean, verbatim quotes are present for load-bearing definitions, and all required sections are substantive.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Inaccurate description of overdetermination** (line 108-109): The article described overdetermination as cases where "both are necessary in that removing either would prevent the outcome"—which describes joint causation, not overdetermination. In overdetermination, each cause independently suffices, making the other redundant.
   - **Resolution**: Corrected to "Each alone would suffice, making the other redundant—a theoretically unsatisfying proliferation of causes."

2. **Missing cross-link to entanglement-binding-hypothesis**: The Part II quantum integration section discussed how delegation and quantum interactionism might combine, but didn't reference the entanglement binding hypothesis—which provides the most concrete mechanism for how delegation could work at quantum level (entangled states as non-decomposable physical states with collective default causal profiles).
   - **Resolution**: Added paragraph in "Relation to Quantum Interactionism" connecting entanglement binding and delegation as addressing complementary aspects (unity vs. causal efficacy). Added to concepts frontmatter and Further Reading.

### Low Issues Found

1. **Stale AI refinement log**: Comment at end of file (lines 258-270) marked "This log should be removed after human review" had been present since 2026-01-29.
   - **Resolution**: Removed.

### Attribution Accuracy Check

All checks passed:
- Subset Law*, Delegatory Law, Observational Closure: verbatim quotes with proper attribution
- "Default causal profile" qualifier: preserved and explained throughout
- Source/Map separation: clear Part I/Part II structure with explicit disclaimer
- No overclaimed commitments or misattributions
- No self-contradictions about quantum dependency

### Counterarguments Considered

All six adversarial personas engaged. No new critical issues beyond those already identified and addressed in previous reviews:
- Eliminative materialist: folk psychological categories as foundation (bedrock disagreement)
- Physicalist: illusionism response adequate (addressed in previous reviews)
- Quantum skeptic: no overclaiming (outer review fixes hold)
- MWI defender: properly labeled as Map-specific (bedrock)
- Empiricist: testability honestly acknowledged
- Buddhist: no-self critique is meta-level (not article-specific)

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Part I/Part II structure with explicit disclaimer — excellent source/Map separation
- Verbatim quotes for Subset Law*, Delegatory Law, Observational Closure
- Major/sergeant preemption analogy — memorable and clarifying
- Five constraints framework — clean organizational structure
- Honest testability acknowledgment — "same predictive boat"
- Substantive Relation to Site Perspective connecting all five tenets
- Illusionism and heterophenomenology engagement

### Enhancements Made
1. Fixed inaccurate overdetermination description
2. Added entanglement binding hypothesis integration in Part II
3. Added [[entanglement-binding-hypothesis]] to concepts frontmatter and Further Reading
4. Removed stale AI refinement log

### Cross-links Added
- [[entanglement-binding-hypothesis]]

## Word Count
- Before: 2618 words (87% of threshold)
- After: 2702 words (90% of threshold)
- Change: +84 words

## Remaining Items
None. All identified issues addressed.

## Stability Notes

**This article has now been reviewed three times (plus an outer review).** It is stable:

- **Overdetermination description** was the only factual inaccuracy found, and it was a description of the concept being contrasted with, not of Saad's theory itself. Now corrected.

- **Entanglement binding connection** is a natural enhancement given the new article, not a correction. The delegatory dualism article already handled quantum integration well; the new paragraph strengthens it with a concrete mechanism.

- **All bedrock disagreements from previous reviews remain unchanged**: MWI proponents, illusionists/eliminativists, and the mechanism question are properly acknowledged as philosophical standoffs rather than addressable flaws.

- **Attribution accuracy is solid**: The outer review's concerns were thoroughly addressed in prior edits. Verbatim quotes, clear source/Map separation, and accurate characterization of Saad's positions are all in place.

**Recommendation**: This article has reached full stability. Future reviews should find no issues unless the article's content is substantively modified or new related research changes the landscape.
