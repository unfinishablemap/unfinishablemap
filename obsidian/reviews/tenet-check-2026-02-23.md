# Tenet Alignment Check

**Date**: 2026-02-23
**Files checked**: 385
**Errors**: 0
**Warnings**: 0
**Notes**: 22

## Summary

All 385 content files across `topics/` (201 files) and `concepts/` (184 files) were checked against the five foundational tenets. No errors or warnings were found. The site maintains strong tenet alignment with no content endorsing or assuming ruled-out positions. 22 notes identify minor tensions that are handled well by the articles themselves -- they represent intellectual honesty rather than alignment failures.

## Errors

None.

## Warnings

None.

## Notes

### topics/epistemology-of-convergence-arguments.md
- **Tenet**: Dualism
- **Issue**: Acknowledges Chinese philosophical divergence as a "genuine challenge to the realist interpretation" and states convergence "cannot stand alone" as an argument for dualism.
- **Assessment**: Intellectual honesty about argument limits. The article explicitly states supplementation by direct arguments is needed.

### topics/evolutionary-case-for-mental-causation.md
- **Tenet**: Dualism
- **Issue**: Acknowledges the evolutionary argument does not by itself establish non-physicality; non-reductive physicalists also accept mental causation.
- **Assessment**: Honest about scope of one argument. Article directs readers to additional arguments elsewhere on the Map.

### topics/experimental-design-for-consciousness-collapse-testing.md
- **Tenet**: Bidirectional Interaction
- **Issue**: Acknowledges "experimental difficulty counts as weak evidence against consciousness-collapse."
- **Assessment**: Intellectual honesty about testability constraints. Not an abandonment of the tenet.

### topics/indian-philosophy-of-mind.md
- **Tenet**: Bidirectional Interaction
- **Issue**: Samkhya's passive *purusha* (pure witness consciousness) creates tension with bidirectional interaction.
- **Assessment**: Article explicitly resolves this: "The Map sides with Nyaya over Samkhya on this point: consciousness acts, it does not merely witness."

### topics/interaction-problem-in-non-western-philosophy.md
- **Tenet**: Dualism
- **Issue**: Presents Chinese and African frameworks that dissolve the interaction problem by rejecting substance dualism.
- **Assessment**: Framed as "productive challenges," not endorsements. Article raises questions without abandoning the Map's position.

### topics/machine-consciousness.md
- **Tenet**: Bidirectional Interaction
- **Issue**: "Open Possibilities" section entertains one-way consciousness -- "experience occurring without the ability to influence physical processes."
- **Assessment**: Presented as a speculative scenario the Map acknowledges but does not endorse. Overall article maintains skepticism about uploading.

### topics/phenomenal-normativity-environmental-ethics.md
- **Tenet**: Minimal Quantum Interaction
- **Issue**: Uses anchor `tenets#^minimal-interaction` instead of `tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction` -- likely a broken link.
- **Assessment**: Technical issue, not a content violation. Content itself is aligned.

### topics/presentiment-and-retrocausality.md
- **Tenet**: Minimal Quantum Interaction
- **Issue**: Extended engagement with parapsychological literature could lend more credibility to borderline "quantum woo" than intended.
- **Assessment**: Article self-corrects with "Why the Map Doesn't Rest on Presentiment" section. Distinguishes physics-based retrocausality from contested parapsychological claims.

### topics/purpose-and-alignment.md
- **Tenet**: Minimal Quantum Interaction
- **Issue**: Suggests pleasure/pain signals "bias quantum outcomes," extending the mechanism beyond standard attention/intention formulations.
- **Assessment**: Speculative extension, not a violation. Framed appropriately within the site perspective section.

### topics/quantum-neural-timing-constraints.md
- **Tenet**: Minimal Quantum Interaction / Occam's Razor
- **Issue**: Acknowledges post-decoherence selection "cannot be falsified by timing evidence" -- an honest unfalsifiability admission.
- **Assessment**: The article handles this tension with exemplary honesty. Tension is inherent in the metaphysical position.

### topics/quantum-randomness-channel-llm-consciousness.md
- **Tenet**: Minimal Quantum Interaction
- **Issue**: Engagement with consciousness-RNG interaction experiments (parapsychological territory). Acknowledges the framework "can accommodate both positive and negative RNG results."
- **Assessment**: Article is transparent about the accommodation concern. Maps position is carefully distinguished from parapsychological claims.

### topics/the-convergence-argument-for-dualism.md
- **Tenet**: Minimal Quantum Interaction / Bidirectional Interaction
- **Issue**: Does not explicitly address Tenets 2 (MQI) or 3 (Bidirectional) in its Relation to Site Perspective section.
- **Assessment**: Omission rather than violation. Article's epistemological scope doesn't require engagement with mechanism tenets.

### topics/the-psychophysical-control-law.md
- **Tenet**: Minimal Quantum Interaction
- **Issue**: Formal proposals for mapping phenomenal states to physical effects push toward specificity.
- **Assessment**: Currently clean. Should be monitored as proposals develop to ensure they stay within MQI bounds.

### topics/the-strong-emergence-of-consciousness.md
- **Tenet**: Dualism
- **Issue**: States the Map "does not commit to panpsychism, though it remains compatible with forms of it."
- **Assessment**: Article self-corrects by identifying that Russellian monism is "identity theory in phenomenal clothing." Adequate self-awareness.

### topics/time-symmetric-selection-mechanism.md
- **Tenet**: Minimal Quantum Interaction
- **Issue**: Atemporal/retrocausal selection mechanism is speculative physics at the outer edge of MQI's spirit.
- **Assessment**: Does not violate the tenet (no energy injection, no psychokinesis). Speculative but appropriately candid.

### concepts/embodied-cognition.md
- **Tenet**: Dualism
- **Issue**: Description field says embodied cognition "challenges Cartesian dualism," which could be misread without the article's full context distinguishing substance from property dualism.
- **Assessment**: Article body carefully distinguishes substance dualism (which EC challenges) from property dualism (which it leaves untouched). Well-handled.

### concepts/control-theoretic-will.md
- **Tenet**: Dualism
- **Issue**: Explicitly acknowledges "A physicalist could adopt every element of the control-theoretic framing" without dualist commitments.
- **Assessment**: Deliberate epistemic honesty in a dedicated "Analogy, Model, and Ontology" section. Article clarifies the Map's dualist commitment comes from independent arguments.

### concepts/epiphenomenalism.md
- **Tenet**: Bidirectional Interaction
- **Issue**: Acknowledges the self-stultification argument's scope is narrower than it first appears -- proves only that *human* consciousness is causally efficacious, not all consciousness.
- **Assessment**: Article explicitly addresses this as an "epistemic gap" while affirming the tenet's general applicability.

### concepts/integrated-information-theory.md
- **Tenet**: Dualism / Bidirectional Interaction
- **Issue**: IIT framed as "ally and rival" with a warmer tone than other physicalist positions. Could more sharply delineate the incompatibility.
- **Assessment**: The conflict is acknowledged. The framing "agree that substrate matters" but "disagree on why" slightly underplays the fundamental incompatibility.

### concepts/mysterianism.md
- **Tenet**: Bidirectional Interaction / Minimal Quantum Interaction
- **Issue**: Extensive treatment of cognitive closure could undermine the Map's specific positive commitments.
- **Assessment**: Article navigates carefully by framing tenets as "commitments, not proofs."

### concepts/minimal-consciousness.md
- **Tenet**: Dualism
- **Issue**: Panpsychism presented alongside the Map's position without noting where it conflicts with the Dualism tenet's irreducibility claim.
- **Assessment**: The Map's "interface dualism" is clearly stated as preferred. But the equal-weight presentation of panpsychism could be improved.

### concepts/mental-imagery.md
- **Tenet**: Bidirectional Interaction
- **Issue**: Gives unusually generous treatment to the physicalist counter-explanation, framing the situation as an "explanatory standoff."
- **Assessment**: Article does connect to the Map's tenets in its Relation to Site Perspective section. The balance tilts more neutrally than typical for the site.

## Patterns Observed

**Strong structural compliance.** Nearly every article includes a "Relation to Site Perspective" section explicitly mapping content to the five tenets. This makes alignment deliberate and traceable.

**Honest engagement with challenges.** Many articles include "What Would Challenge This View?" sections with explicit falsification criteria, demonstrating the Map's positions are held as responsive to evidence rather than dogmatically.

**Opposing views discussed, never endorsed.** Articles on materialism, functionalism, illusionism, epiphenomenalism, panpsychism, and many-worlds consistently present these views for critique and comparison without endorsing them.

**AI refinement logs document self-correction.** Multiple files contain refinement logs showing where overclaiming was corrected -- evidence of ongoing quality control that strengthens tenet alignment.

## Files Passing All Checks

All 385 files pass at the ERROR and WARNING levels. 363 files pass completely with no findings of any kind.
