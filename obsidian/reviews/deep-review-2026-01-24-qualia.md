# Deep Review: Qualia

**Date**: 2026-01-24
**File**: obsidian/concepts/qualia.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-20T09:35:00+00:00

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Missing cross-links to recent articles**: Added [[phenomenal-consciousness]], [[access-consciousness]], [[conscious-vs-unconscious-processing]], [[baseline-cognition]] to frontmatter and Further Reading

### Medium Issues Found
- **Access/phenomenal distinction underdeveloped**: Added paragraph after opening explaining qualia's relationship to phenomenal consciousness vs access consciousness
- **Jackson's later retraction unmentioned**: Added note that Jackson recanted though the Map maintains the argument succeeds
- **Unsourced claim (82% statistic)**: Softened to "surveys suggest most non-philosophers agree"
- **Missing cross-link to [[buddhism-and-dualism]]**: Added as new challenge condition and in Further Reading
- **Missing cross-link to [[mysterianism-cognitive-closure]]**: Added in Further Reading

### Counterarguments Considered
- Eliminative materialist challenge to qualia's existence: Already addressed in illusionism section
- Buddhist no-self challenge to qualia ownership: Added as new challenge condition #6

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Four properties of qualia clearly explained (intrinsic, private, ineffable, directly apprehensible)
- Thorough treatment of illusionism challenge and regress objection
- Process philosophy section offers valuable alternative framing
- Thought experiments well-explained with appropriate depth
- Connection to all five tenets is substantive

### Enhancements Made
- Clarified relationship between qualia and phenomenal/access consciousness distinction
- Added sixth challenge condition (Buddhist no-self)
- Updated section header to "Relation to Site Perspective" for consistency
- Enhanced Further Reading with six new cross-links

### Cross-links Added
- [[phenomenal-consciousness]]
- [[access-consciousness]]
- [[conscious-vs-unconscious-processing]]
- [[baseline-cognition]]
- [[mysterianism-cognitive-closure]]
- [[buddhism-and-dualism]]

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues addressed in this session.
