# Pessimistic Review

**Date**: 2026-02-22
**Content reviewed**: obsidian/concepts/functionalism.md

## Executive Summary

The functionalism article is well-structured and covers the major objections to functionalism, but it contains several question-begging arguments, presents contested thought experiments as decisive, and understates the strongest functionalist responses. The C. elegans and Physarum examples are used in ways that don't actually challenge functionalism, and the article conflates "physically implementable" with "physical" without argument—a conflation that undermines its central claim.

## Critiques by Philosopher

### The Eliminative Materialist

Patricia Churchland would identify the article's deepest flaw: it treats qualia as an unquestioned given and then argues functionalism fails to accommodate them. But the concept of qualia may itself be confused folk psychology. The absent qualia objection assumes there are irreducible qualitative properties to be "absent"—exactly what the functionalist (and the eliminativist) disputes. The article says "If either [inverted or absent qualia] is possible, functionalism is false." But whether they're possible is precisely what's at issue. You can't refute a theory by assuming its negation.

The article also moves too quickly past the neuroscience. The COGITATE experiment is mentioned but its actual results are not described. What did Melloni et al. find? Which predictions succeeded, which failed? The article uses the experiment as a vague gesture toward "both theories fail" without engaging with what the data actually showed—a missed opportunity for the kind of empirical engagement that would strengthen the article.

### The Hard-Nosed Physicalist

Dennett would object to the dismissive treatment of his position. The article mentions his heterophenomenological approach in a single sentence, then immediately pivots to Searle's response. But heterophenomenology is a methodological proposal about how to study consciousness—take reports as data without assuming they accurately describe inner states. The article doesn't explain why this methodology fails; it simply moves past it.

More significantly, the article quotes Galen Strawson's "silliest claim ever made" as though this settles the case against illusionism. But Strawson's dismissal is itself a philosophical position, not a refutation. Frankish, Dennett, and others have extensive responses: the "seeming" that Strawson points to may itself be a representation that doesn't have the properties it represents. The article treats the Strawson quote as a knockout blow when it's actually one move in an ongoing dialectic.

The article also claims that "functional description is still physical description (or at least physically implementable)." Dennett would point out the equivocation: functionalism's insight is that the relevant description level is *organizational*, not physical. Saying something is "physically implementable" doesn't make the organization itself a physical property—the same way a symphony's structure is physically implementable (by orchestras, synthesizers, etc.) without the structure being a physical thing.

### The Quantum Skeptic

Tegmark would find the "Relation to the Map's Perspective" section's quantum claims unsupported within this article. The section states that "Quantum effects" in the empirical tractability subsection would correlate with consciousness—but no mechanism is described, no experiment proposed, and no evidence cited. The article says the Minimal Quantum Interaction hypothesis "predicts consciousness correlates with quantum-sensitive processes" but this is a restatement of the tenet, not a testable prediction. What specific quantum-sensitive process? How would you measure the correlation? Without this specificity, the claim functions as a promissory note rather than a scientific hypothesis.

The temporal structure argument against functionalism also lacks physical grounding. The article says digital computation "lacks this structure" because "sequential processing executes one instruction after another, each atemporal." But modern processors execute billions of operations per second with complex timing relationships. Why is neural temporal structure privileged? The article doesn't engage with the possibility that sufficiently complex computational timing could implement temporal phenomenology.

### The Many-Worlds Defender

Deutsch would note an irony: the article argues against functionalism partly on the grounds that consciousness requires specific physical substrate, but the Map's own dualism implies consciousness is *non-physical*. If consciousness is non-physical, why would the physical substrate of its implementation matter? The article wants substrate to matter (against functionalism) while also claiming consciousness transcends any substrate (dualism). These two commitments pull in opposite directions, and the article doesn't acknowledge the tension.

### The Empiricist

A Popperian would ask: what would convince the Map that functionalism is true? The article's "Empirical Tractability" section proposes tests, but they're framed to confirm the Map's position. "If functionalism is true, functionally equivalent systems should have equivalent conscious states"—but how would you test this without solving the problem of other minds first? "Dualism predicts systematic behavioral differences between biological and computational systems"—what specific behavioral differences? Without pre-registered predictions, this is retrodiction dressed as prediction.

The article also fails to acknowledge that the Map's own position—consciousness requires something non-physical—is equally unfalsifiable. If a silicon system behaved identically to a human in every measurable respect, the Map could always say "but it lacks the non-physical component." What observation would rule this out?

### The Buddhist Philosopher

Nagarjuna would question the article's unexamined assumption that consciousness is a *thing*—an entity that is either present or absent, that either has qualia or doesn't. Both functionalism and the Map's dualism reify consciousness into a substance with properties. But what if consciousness is empty of inherent existence—not a thing that "has" phenomenal character, but a process without a fixed essence?

The absent qualia argument assumes you can remove the qualitative character while preserving everything else. But if consciousness is not a separable component, the thought experiment is incoherent—not because functionalism is true, but because the framework of "having" or "lacking" qualia misunderstands what consciousness is. The article never considers this possibility.

## Critical Issues

### Issue 1: The C. elegans Argument Doesn't Challenge Functionalism

- **File**: obsidian/concepts/functionalism.md
- **Location**: "The Minimal Consciousness Challenge" section
- **Problem**: The article says "If functionalism were true, [complete structural knowledge] should tell us whether the worm is conscious." But functionalists don't claim that knowing the connectome entails knowing whether something is conscious—they claim that consciousness consists in playing the right functional role. We might have the wiring diagram but not yet know which functional roles constitute consciousness. This is an epistemic gap (we don't know enough yet), not a failure of functionalism as a theory. The article conflates having complete structural data with having a complete functional theory.
- **Severity**: High
- **Recommendation**: Reframe the C. elegans example. The challenge to functionalism isn't that we have the connectome and can't determine consciousness—it's that functionalism provides no principled way to specify *which* functional roles constitute consciousness without smuggling in phenomenal concepts that functionalism is supposed to eliminate.

### Issue 2: The Physarum Example Actually Supports Functionalism

- **File**: obsidian/concepts/functionalism.md
- **Location**: "The Minimal Consciousness Challenge" section
- **Problem**: The article presents Physarum polycephalum (slime mold solving mazes) as a challenge to functionalism, arguing that if function determines consciousness, we'd need to determine whether the slime mold is conscious. But most functionalists would simply say that maze-solving doesn't require consciousness—it's implementable by simple algorithms. The article then says this "concedes the point at issue" because it requires knowing *how* a function is implemented. But that's not what the functionalist concedes—they'd say the slime mold implements a *different, simpler* functional organization that doesn't include the functional roles constitutive of consciousness. This is consistent with functionalism, not a challenge to it.
- **Severity**: High
- **Recommendation**: Either remove the Physarum example or reframe it. The genuine challenge from minimal organisms is the *boundary problem*: at what level of functional complexity does consciousness arise, and can functionalism specify this without circularity?

### Issue 3: Conflation of "Physically Implementable" with "Physical"

- **File**: obsidian/concepts/functionalism.md
- **Location**: Opening paragraph and "Relation to the Map's Perspective" section
- **Problem**: The article states "functional organization is a physical (or at least physically implementable) property" and uses this to argue that rejecting dualism requires rejecting functionalism. But this conflation is contested. Functional organization is an *abstract* property—the same causal structure can be implemented in many substrates. Calling something "physically implementable" doesn't make it physical, any more than the number 7 is physical because it can be physically represented. The article needs to either argue for the conflation or acknowledge the distinction.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Recommendation**: Add a brief argument for why "physically implementable" properties should be considered physical, or acknowledge that functionalism might occupy a middle ground between physicalism and dualism—which would complicate the article's framing.

### Issue 4: Strawson Quote Used as Unargued Authority

- **File**: obsidian/concepts/functionalism.md
- **Location**: "The Illusionist Response" subsection
- **Problem**: The article quotes Strawson's "the silliest claim ever made" and presents it as though it refutes illusionism. But this is an appeal to ridicule, not an argument. The subsequent sentence ("for if there is seeming, there is phenomenal character") is the actual argument, but it's stated without defense. Dennett and Frankish have responded extensively: "seeming" may be a representational state that misrepresents its own properties. The article doesn't engage with this response.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Recommendation**: Replace the Strawson quote with the actual philosophical argument. Present the illusionist response to the "seeming" point (phenomenal concepts strategy, meta-cognitive misrepresentation) and explain why the Map finds it insufficient.

### Issue 5: COGITATE Experiment Described Without Content

- **File**: obsidian/concepts/functionalism.md
- **Location**: "Global Workspace Theory" subsection
- **Problem**: The article calls COGITATE "the largest adversarial collaboration in consciousness science" but doesn't describe what it tested, what predictions were made, or what the results were. The summary ("Neither theory's predictions were fully confirmed") is too vague to be informative. This is the kind of empirical detail that would strengthen the article—showing that functionalist frameworks have been tested and found wanting—but instead it's used as a hand-wave.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Recommendation**: Either describe the COGITATE results in enough detail to be informative (which predictions failed, how this bears on functionalism) or remove the reference. A vague gesture at empirical failure is worse than no mention at all.

## Counterarguments to Address

### Functionalism as Non-Physical

- **Current content says**: "functional description is still physical description (or at least physically implementable)"
- **A critic would argue**: Functional properties are abstract organizational properties, not physical properties. A Turing machine is defined by its state transition table—an abstract mathematical object—not by any physical implementation. Functionalism claims consciousness is this kind of abstract property. If the Map's objection is that functional organization is "physical," it needs to argue against the abstractness of functional description, not just assert the conflation.
- **Suggested response**: Acknowledge the distinction between abstract functional description and physical implementation. The Map's objection should be reframed: even if functional organization is abstract, the Map's claim is that consciousness involves something that *no* organizational description—abstract or physical—captures. The problem isn't that functionalism is physical; it's that it's *structural*, and consciousness has non-structural (phenomenal) aspects.

### The Systems Reply to the Chinese Room

- **Current content says**: Searle responds that if the person memorizes the rules, they *are* the system, yet still don't understand
- **A critic would argue**: Searle's response here begs the question. Just because the person doesn't *seem to themselves* to understand Chinese doesn't mean the system (which includes the memorized rules operating at a level below personal introspection) doesn't understand. We don't introspect our neural processes either, yet our brains understand. The Map's reliance on the Chinese Room should acknowledge that the majority of contemporary philosophers of mind find the systems reply persuasive.
- **Suggested response**: Note the ongoing disagreement rather than treating Searle's response as decisive. The Map's rejection of functionalism doesn't depend on the Chinese Room alone—the convergence of multiple arguments (absent qualia, explanatory gap, temporal structure) provides the stronger case.

## Unsupported Claims

| Claim | Location | Needed Support |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| "functional organization is a physical (or at least physically implementable) property" | Opening paragraph | Argument for why "physically implementable" entails "physical" |
| "digital computation lacks [temporal] structure" | Temporal Structure subsection | Engagement with complex computational timing and why it differs from neural timing |
| "Dualism predicts systematic behavioral differences between biological and computational systems" | Empirical Tractability | Specification of what differences are predicted |
| COGITATE: "Neither theory's predictions were fully confirmed" | GWT subsection | Actual description of results |
| "The felt quality of experience transcends functional role" | Dualism and Qualia subsection | This is the central disputed claim—needs more than assertion |

## Language Improvements

| Current | Issue | Suggested |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| "The deepest objection to functionalism" | Unjustified superlative | "A central objection to functionalism" |
| "the silliest claim ever made" | Appeal to ridicule (quoted) | Keep quote but present it as one position in a live debate, not a clincher |
| "Functionalism has trouble with this" | Understated relative to the argumentative commitment | Either strengthen to match confidence or acknowledge genuine difficulty |
| "purely computational systems cannot be conscious" | Stated without qualification in AI section | "On the Map's view, purely computational systems are unlikely to be conscious" |

## Strengths (Brief)

Despite these criticisms, the article has significant strengths worth preserving in revision:

- **IIT as physicalist anti-functionalism**: The section showing IIT rejects functionalism from within physicalism is excellent—it demonstrates that the Map's rejection isn't merely a dualist move, lending credibility by showing convergence from different starting points.
- **Clear structure**: The article follows the style guide well, with front-loaded core claims and explicit tenet connections.
- **Fair presentation of functionalism's appeal**: The "Functionalism's Appeal" section acknowledges the genuine strengths of the view rather than strawmanning it.
- **Multiple realizability handled well**: The article uses multiple realizability to motivate functionalism fairly before critiquing it, rather than dismissing the insight.
- **Proper references**: Academic citations are present and appropriately used throughout.
