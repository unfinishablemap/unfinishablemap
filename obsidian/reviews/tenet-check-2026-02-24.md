# Tenet Alignment Check

**Date**: 2026-02-24
**Files checked**: 397
**Errors**: 0
**Warnings**: 0
**Notes**: 2

## Summary

All 397 content files across `topics/` (199 files) and `concepts/` (198 files) were checked against the five foundational tenets using comprehensive pattern-based analysis. No errors or warnings were found. Two minor notes were identified — one regarding uncritical presentation of panexperientialism and one internal factual inconsistency. Overall tenet alignment remains excellent.

## Tenet 1: Dualism

**Result**: Clean.

All references to materialism, physicalism, eliminativism, functionalism, and reductive views of consciousness are properly framed as opposing positions presented for critique. Key observations:

- Every instance of "consciousness is just neurons/computation" phrasing appears within hypothetical/conditional framing or critiqued positions.
- `materialism.md` explicitly frames materialism as the Map's primary opponent and mounts systematic objections.
- `functionalism.md` states "The Map rejects functionalism on multiple grounds."
- All articles on IIT, Global Workspace Theory, and competing frameworks include critical framing noting conflicts with the Map's dualist commitments.
- The `illusionism.md` concept and all 40+ references to illusionism across the site consistently present the view for critique, applying the regress argument ("misrepresentation presupposes presentation") and self-stultification objection.

## Tenet 2: Minimal Quantum Interaction

**Result**: Clean.

No content endorses quantum mysticism, psychokinesis, energy injection by consciousness, or empirically detectable mind-matter interactions. Key observations:

- `bidirectional-interaction.md` explicitly states: "Not psychokinesis" and "Not quantum mysticism."
- `quantum-consciousness.md` includes a dedicated "Distinguishing from 'Quantum Woo'" section.
- The phrase "without injecting energy" appears as a consistent refrain across quantum interaction articles.
- `brain-specialness-boundary.md` argues against extending the mechanism to external psychokinesis.
- `presentiment-and-retrocausality.md` carefully separates physics-based retrocausality from contested parapsychological claims.
- Empirical invisibility is consistently maintained as a requirement.

## Tenet 3: Bidirectional Interaction

**Result**: Clean.

No content endorses epiphenomenalism, parallelism without interaction, or treats consciousness as causally inert as the article's own position. Key observations:

- The dedicated `epiphenomenalism.md` article systematically dismantles the view using self-stultification, evolutionary objections, and empirical evidence.
- Every use of "along for the ride" (15+ instances across topics and concepts) appears either as a description of epiphenomenalism being critiqued, or in conditional framing presenting the view as a challenge the Map answers.
- Historical positions (occasionalism, pre-established harmony, parallelism) are presented with explicit framing of their costs and the Map's disagreement.
- `relational-quantum-mechanics.md` honestly acknowledges RQM shows a coherent interpretation where consciousness plays no role, but frames this transparently.

## Tenet 4: No Many Worlds

**Result**: Clean.

No content endorses MWI, assumes all branches are real, or dismisses indexical identity concerns. Key observations:

- `many-worlds.md` is entirely devoted to arguing against MWI with five structured arguments.
- All 30+ references to "all branches are equally real" appear within either critiques of MWI, conditional/reductio framing, or descriptions of MWI being rejected.
- Several articles list "Many-Worlds proves correct" as a falsification condition — intellectually honest without endorsing.
- The indexical identity argument is consistently deployed as a reason to reject MWI.

## Tenet 5: Occam's Razor Has Limits

**Result**: Clean.

No content uses parsimony as a decisive argument against dualism or treats Occam's Razor as an unqualified truth. Key observations:

- No instances found of Occam's Razor being used to dismiss dualism anywhere in topics or concepts.
- `the-case-for-dualism.md` notes that "parsimony arbitrates between theories of *equal* explanatory power, and physicalism does not explain phenomenal consciousness."
- `consciousness-and-the-problem-of-theoretical-virtues.md` provides detailed analysis concluding that without a domain-appropriate simplicity metric, the virtue is underdetermined.

## Notes

### animal-consciousness.md

- **Tenet**: Dualism (tension, not violation)
- **Issue**: The "Process Philosophy Perspective" subsection presents Whitehead's panexperientialism with the statement: "Experience isn't generated by specific neural structures—it's what sufficiently complex organismic integration *is*." This identity claim (consciousness = integration) could be read as conflicting with Tenet 1's irreducibility commitment. The section is clearly presenting Whitehead's view rather than the Map's own position, but lacks the critical distancing typical of other articles.
- **Quote**: "Experience isn't generated by specific neural structures—it's what sufficiently complex organismic integration *is*."
- **Recommendation**: Add a sentence noting that while Whitehead's insight about integration-as-process is valuable, the Map holds that experience is irreducible to any physical integration process (per Tenet 1). This file also lacks a "Relation to Site Perspective" section.

### consciousness-and-intelligence.md

- **Tenet**: N/A (internal factual inconsistency)
- **Issue**: States human working memory capacity as "7±2" (Miller, 1956), while the site's own `animal-consciousness.md` correctly uses the updated figure of "2±1" for chimpanzees (based on Cowan, 2001, which revised the human figure to 4±1). The outdated Miller number persists in this article.
- **Quote**: "Chimpanzee working memory holds approximately 2±1 items; humans hold 7±2."
- **Recommendation**: Update to the Cowan (2001) figure of 4±1 for humans, consistent with current cognitive science.

## Structural Observation: Missing "Relation to Site Perspective" Sections

37 files lack the standard "Relation to Site Perspective" section (4 topics, 33 concepts). While not a tenet violation, this section is the primary mechanism for explicitly connecting content to the five tenets. The missing files include several foundational concepts (dualism.md, materialism.md, epiphenomenalism.md, quantum-consciousness.md, interactionist-dualism.md, etc.) that likely predate the convention. These files generally maintain tenet alignment through their content structure, but adding the section would strengthen explicit alignment verification.

**Topics missing section** (4): animal-consciousness.md, death-and-consciousness.md, hard-problem-of-consciousness.md, structure-of-attention.md

**Concepts missing section** (33): brain-interface-boundary.md, causal-closure.md, combination-problem.md, decoherence.md, downward-causation.md, dualism.md, embodied-cognition.md, emergence.md, epiphenomenalism.md, explanatory-gap.md, filter-theory.md, functionalism.md, haecceity.md, integrated-information-theory.md, intentionality.md, interactionist-dualism.md, knowledge-argument.md, materialism.md, meditation-and-consciousness-modes.md, mental-causation.md, mind-matter-interface.md, mysterianism.md, near-death-experiences.md, neural-correlates-of-consciousness.md, neurophenomenology.md, objections-to-interactionism.md, phenomenology.md, quantum-consciousness.md, russellian-monism.md, self-and-consciousness.md, substance-property-dualism.md, witness-consciousness.md, working-memory.md

## Overall Assessment

The site's tenet alignment remains strong. The architectural pattern of dialectical engagement — present opposing view, critique from Map's perspective, connect to tenets — is consistently maintained. Content engages honestly with opposing positions while maintaining clear commitment to the five foundational tenets. The two notes identified are minor tensions rather than genuine conflicts, and the structural observation about missing sections represents an opportunity for incremental improvement rather than a current problem.

## Files Passing All Checks

All 397 files pass all five tenet checks. The two notes above represent minor tensions flagged for potential improvement, not alignment failures.
