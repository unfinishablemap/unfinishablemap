# Tenet Alignment Check

**Date**: 2026-02-24
**Files checked**: 398
**Errors**: 0
**Warnings**: 0
**Notes**: 0

## Summary

All 398 content files across `topics/` (203 files) and `concepts/` (195 files) were checked against the five foundational tenets. No errors, warnings, or notes were found. The site maintains excellent tenet alignment across all content.

## Tenet 1: Dualism

**Result**: Clean.

All references to materialism, physicalism, eliminativism, functionalism, and reductive views of consciousness are properly framed as opposing positions presented for critique. Key observations:

- The `materialism.md` article explicitly frames materialism as "the Map's primary opponent" and mounts systematic objections.
- The `functionalism.md` article states "The Map rejects functionalism on multiple grounds."
- Every instance of "consciousness is just neurons/computation" phrasing uses hypothetical/conditional framing or appears within critiqued positions.
- All articles on IIT, Global Workspace Theory, and other competing frameworks include "Relation to Site Perspective" sections noting conflicts with the Map's dualist commitments.
- A strong architectural pattern persists: every article engaging opposing views includes dialectical structure with critique, a "Relation to Site Perspective" section, and "What Would Challenge This View?" falsifiability conditions.

## Tenet 2: Minimal Quantum Interaction

**Result**: Clean.

No content endorses quantum mysticism, psychokinesis, energy injection by consciousness, or empirically detectable mind-matter interactions. Key observations:

- `brain-specialness-boundary.md` devotes its entire argument to explaining why the Map's mechanism does NOT extend to external psychokinesis, treating PEAR lab results as consistent with null effects.
- `bidirectional-interaction.md` explicitly states: "Not psychokinesis" and "Not quantum mysticism."
- The phrase "without injecting energy" appears as a consistent refrain across dozens of articles.
- `quantum-consciousness.md` includes a dedicated "Distinguishing from 'Quantum Woo'" section.
- `presentiment-and-retrocausality.md` carefully separates physics-based retrocausality from contested parapsychological claims and states the Map does NOT rest on presentiment research.
- `spontaneous-collapse-theories.md` honestly notes Orch OR's conflict with minimal interaction, correctly stating the Map favors smaller-scale quantum selection.
- Empirical invisibility is consistently maintained as a requirement across all quantum interaction articles.

## Tenet 3: Bidirectional Interaction

**Result**: Clean.

No content endorses epiphenomenalism, parallelism without interaction, or treats consciousness as causally inert as the article's own position. Key observations:

- The dedicated `epiphenomenalism.md` article systematically dismantles the view using self-stultification, evolutionary objections, and empirical evidence, explicitly stating: "The Unfinishable Map's tenets explicitly reject epiphenomenalism."
- Historical positions (occasionalism, pre-established harmony, parallelism) are presented in `elisabeths-contemporaries-and-the-interaction-debate.md` with explicit framing of their costs and the Map's disagreement.
- `leibnizs-mill-argument.md` notes: "Leibniz himself denied mind-body interaction, preferring pre-established harmony. The Map disagrees."
- `relational-quantum-mechanics.md` honestly acknowledges RQM shows a coherent interpretation where consciousness plays no role, but frames this transparently as identifying "what quantum mechanics requires from what the Map's tenets add."
- Every epiphenomenalism reference either critiques the view, uses it in a conditional/reductio frame, or presents it as a threat that the Map answers.

## Tenet 4: No Many Worlds

**Result**: Clean.

No content endorses MWI, assumes all branches are real, or dismisses indexical identity concerns. Key observations:

- `many-worlds.md` is entirely devoted to arguing against MWI with five structured arguments (ontological extravagance, indexical identity, probability, preferred basis, consciousness unexplained).
- Dozens of articles invoke the No Many Worlds tenet in their "Relation to Site Perspective" sections, consistently rejecting MWI.
- MWI is used appropriately as a contrasting position across articles like `collapse-and-time.md`, `quantum-measurement-consciousness-interface.md`, and `quantum-indeterminacy-free-will.md`.
- Several articles list "Many-Worlds proves correct" as a falsification condition — intellectually honest without endorsing.
- `simulation.md` discusses MWI in a conditional frame and immediately proceeds to explain how objective collapse preserves single outcomes and indexical identity.

## Tenet 5: Occam's Razor Has Limits

**Result**: Clean.

No content uses parsimony as a decisive argument against dualism or treats Occam's Razor as an unqualified truth. Key observations:

- Every mention of Occam's Razor or parsimony either explicitly frames it as a limited heuristic, presents parsimony-based objections only to rebut them, or uses parsimony arguments in service of the Map's own dualist framework.
- `objections-to-interactionism.md` lays out the parsimony objection in formal syllogism form, then provides four distinct responses.
- `the-case-for-dualism.md` notes that "parsimony arbitrates between theories of *equal* explanatory power, and physicalism does not explain phenomenal consciousness."
- `materialism.md` states: "Occam's Razor Has Limits explains why materialism's apparent simplicity is misleading."
- `philosophy-of-science-under-dualism.md` argues: "Parsimony that requires denying the most certain datum we have — our own experience — is not genuine parsimony."
- `consciousness-and-the-problem-of-theoretical-virtues.md` provides analytical depth, concluding that without a domain-appropriate simplicity metric, the virtue is underdetermined.

## Overall Assessment

The site's tenet alignment remains strong. The architectural pattern of dialectical engagement — present opposing view, critique from Map's perspective, connect to tenets — is consistently maintained across all 398 files. Content engages honestly with opposing positions while maintaining clear commitment to the five foundational tenets. The 13 new files added since the last check (2026-02-23, 385 files) are all properly aligned.

## Files Passing All Checks

All 398 files pass all five tenet checks.
