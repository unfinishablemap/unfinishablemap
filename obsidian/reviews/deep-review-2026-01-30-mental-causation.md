**Date**: 2026-01-30
**Article**: [[mental-causation|Mental Causation]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-29-mental-causation|2026-01-29]]
**Word count**: 2931 → 2933 (+2, length-neutral)
**Context**: Update with delegation and preemption framework per user request

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article was at stability from the 2026-01-29 review. All six adversarial personas engaged; no new critical issues identified.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Delegatory dualism section brief**: The 2026-01-29 review added delegatory dualism but only with a basic summary. The preemption mechanism wasn't fully explained—readers couldn't distinguish preemption from overdetermination. [RESOLVED: Expanded with mechanism explanation and military analogy]

### Counterarguments Considered
- Eliminative materialist: Folk psychology may be eliminable—but this is a philosophical standoff, not a flaw
- Hard-nosed physicalist: Illusionism section conflates Dennett/Frankish somewhat—deferred as low priority
- Quantum skeptic: Decoherence challenge acknowledged as genuine; protective mechanisms presented appropriately as speculative
- MWI defender: Philosophical standoff noted in previous review
- Empiricist: Falsifiability conditions strong; noted that delegatory dualism is in "same predictive boat" as other theories
- Buddhist philosopher: Agent causation presupposes substantial self—philosophical standoff

### Attribution Check
PASS. Verified:
- Saad's preemption mechanism correctly described
- "Default causal profile" terminology accurate
- Universal/observational closure distinction accurate
- No misattributions, dropped qualifiers, or source/Map conflation

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Self-stultification argument: Clear, epistemically powerful
- Kim's exclusion argument presentation: Fair and comprehensive
- Quantum opening explanation: Accessible without oversimplifying
- Agent causation section: Good phenomenological grounding
- Falsifiability conditions: Demonstrates epistemic humility
- Process philosophy alternative: Effective complementary framing

### Enhancements Made
- Expanded delegatory dualism section with:
  - "Default causal profile" mechanism explanation
  - Saad's major/sergeant military analogy for preemption
  - Clear contrast between preemption and overdetermination
- Tightened Overdetermination, Interventionism, Inheritance, Strong Emergence, and Why This Matters sections to maintain length neutrality

### Cross-links Maintained
- [[delegatory-dualism]] already in concepts frontmatter and Further Reading from previous review

## Remaining Items

None. The requested enhancement (delegation and preemption framework) is complete.

## Stability Notes

This is the fourth deep review. The article has reached stability:

- **The MWI objection** remains a philosophical standoff—Many-Worlds defenders will find the indexical argument unsatisfying. Bedrock disagreement, not a flaw.

- **The decoherence objection** is acknowledged as genuinely challenging while noting it doesn't solve the measurement problem. Future physics research may strengthen or weaken the quantum opening.

- **The illusionist challenge** is engaged adequately. The regress problem is a standard response; this is ongoing philosophical debate. Minor conflation of Dennett/Frankish noted but not critical.

- **The specification problem** is properly connected to the psychophysical-laws-framework. This remains the main area for future development as mechanism proposals develop.

- **Delegatory dualism** now fully explained. The preemption mechanism is distinguished from overdetermination using Saad's military analogy. The article now presents both the causal structure (delegation) and causal mechanism (quantum) aspects of mental causation.

The article is at 117% of soft threshold (2933 words). Further expansion is not warranted; future reviews should focus on accuracy and connection maintenance.
