**Date**: 2026-03-01
**Article**: [[apex-articles|Apex Articles Index]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Incorrect source article slug (entry 1)**: `concepts/phenomenal-value-realism` → corrected to `topics/phenomenal-value-realism` (file is in topics/, not concepts/)
- **Incorrect source article slug (entry 5)**: `concepts/meditation-consciousness-modes` → corrected to `concepts/meditation-and-consciousness-modes` (missing "and")
- **Incorrect source article slug (entry 10)**: `arguments/epiphenomenalism` → corrected to `arguments/epiphenomenalism-argument` (incomplete slug)
- **Incorrect source article slug (entry 12)**: `concepts/volitional-opacity` → corrected to `voids/volitional-opacity` (file is in voids/, not concepts/)

### Medium Issues Found
- **Orphaned page (zero inbound links)**: Resolved by adding links from `apex.md` (section index) and `writing-style.md`
- **Non-standard frontmatter**: Removed `date: &id001` YAML anchor and `modified: *id001` alias; normalized to standard schema
- **Missing `last_deep_review` field**: Added
- **Missing "Relation to Site Perspective" section**: Added brief section connecting curation rationale to the Map's tenets
- **No cross-links in opening paragraph**: Added wikilinks to `[[apex]]`, `[[topics]]`, `[[concepts]]`, `[[writing-style]]`, and three representative apex articles

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative Materialist / Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: The theses listed for each apex article assert dualist positions, but this is appropriate for an index page reflecting the Map's foundational commitments — not a flaw to fix.
- **"Index pages don't need tenet sections"**: While this is primarily organizational, the curation rationale connects meaningfully to the Map's philosophy of depth over breadth. A brief section was warranted.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear, well-articulated thesis statements for each apex article
- Consistent entry structure (slug, subtitle, thesis, source articles, status)
- Practical guidelines section with actionable constraints
- Good thematic coverage across 12 articles spanning consciousness, agency, identity, time, AI, and phenomenology

### Enhancements Made
- Enriched opening paragraph with wikilinks and context about the apex article purpose
- Added second paragraph linking to topics, concepts, and writing style guide
- Added "Relation to Site Perspective" section explaining curation philosophy
- Fixed 4 incorrect source article references

### Cross-links Added
- [[apex]] (from apex-articles.md related_articles and body text)
- [[consciousness-and-agency]] (opening paragraph)
- [[machine-question]] (opening paragraph)
- [[time-consciousness-growing-block]] (opening paragraph)
- [[topics]] (body text)
- [[concepts]] (body text)
- [[writing-style]] (body text)
- [[tenets]] (Relation to Site Perspective)

### Inbound Links Created
- [[apex-articles]] from `apex.md` (section index) — most natural integration point
- [[apex-articles]] from `writing-style.md` (apex articles subsection)

## Remaining Items

- The P2 integrate-orphan task in `todo.md` has been marked completed
- No follow-up tasks needed — the page is now well-integrated

## Stability Notes

This is the first review of this document. The page is primarily organizational/index content rather than philosophical argument, so future reviews should focus on accuracy of source article references (which may drift as articles are renamed or reorganized) rather than philosophical depth. The four slug errors found here suggest periodic verification of source paths would be valuable.
