**Date**: 2026-02-25
**Article**: [[altered-states-of-consciousness|Altered States of Consciousness]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-26-altered-states-of-consciousness|2026-01-26]]

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

- **Wrong date on quantum entanglement claim**: Article said "2024 evidence of macroscopic quantum entanglement signatures in living human brains" but the study is Kerskens & Pérez López (2022). Resolution: corrected date, added proper attribution and citation, added "If confirmed" qualifier.
- **Wrong date on Michigan NDE study**: Article said "A 2024 University of Michigan study found gamma surges in dying patients" but the study is Xu et al. (2023). Resolution: corrected date and added proper attribution.

### Medium Issues Found

- **"Mashour et al. (2024)" for two-author paper**: Should be "Mashour and Bharioke (2024)". Resolution: corrected citation form.
- **Uncited hypnosis neuroimaging claim**: "Recent neuroimaging (2025)" had no specific citation and used relative time language against style guide. Resolution: removed "Recent", added Jiang et al. (2017) citation for functional connectivity claims, corrected "anterior default mode network activity" to the more precise "functional connectivity between executive control and salience networks."
- **Missing cross-links**: Recently created articles (anaesthesia-and-the-consciousness-interface, contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness) not linked. Resolution: added to related_articles and Further Reading.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Dennett-style functionalist objection**: Flow and meditation states as modified information processing rather than "consciousness releasing control." Bedrock disagreement from previous review — not re-flagged.
- **MWI phenomenological argument weakness**: Altered states "feeling like" one consciousness is phenomenological, not physical argument. Bedrock disagreement from previous review — not re-flagged.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Excellent filter theory framing in opening paragraph
- Effective propofol/ketamine divergence argument (genuinely compelling for dualism)
- Well-integrated Tart's taxonomy with 2025 thalamic research
- Appropriate hedging on Orch OR/quantum claims
- Boundary States section provides creative philosophical integration between ASCs and minimal consciousness
- Substantive "Relation to Site Perspective" section connecting to all relevant tenets
- Strong confabulation response with clinical evidence (psilocybin therapy)

### Enhancements Made

- Corrected 2 wrong dates on empirical claims (quantum entanglement: 2024→2022, Michigan NDE: 2024→2023)
- Added 3 missing citations (Kerskens & Pérez López 2022, Jiang et al. 2017, Xu et al. 2023)
- Fixed citation format for two-author paper (Mashour et al. → Mashour and Bharioke)
- Added cross-links to recently created articles (anaesthesia-and-the-consciousness-interface, contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness)
- Corrected imprecise claim about "anterior default mode network activity" to "functional connectivity between executive control and salience networks"

### Cross-links Added

- [[anaesthesia-and-the-consciousness-interface]]
- [[contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness]]

## Word Count

Before: 1860 words (74% of 2500 soft threshold)
After: 1969 words (79% of 2500 soft threshold)

Change: +109 words (primarily from proper citations and attributions). Article remains well under threshold.

## Remaining Items

None. All critical issues addressed. The article is in good condition.

## Stability Notes

This article has now received three deep reviews (2026-01-19, 2026-01-26, 2026-02-25). It has reached stability:

- **No philosophical disagreements re-flagged** — The bedrock disagreements identified in the 2026-01-26 review (MWI phenomenological argument, functionalist interpretation of meditation) remain acknowledged and are not article flaws.
- **Primary value of this review was citation accuracy** — The article's arguments and structure were stable; the issues found were factual (wrong dates, missing citations), not structural or philosophical.
- **Future reviews** should focus on: checking whether newly created Map articles warrant additional cross-links, and verifying any new empirical claims have proper citations. The article's content and arguments should not need further modification unless the underlying science changes significantly.
