**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article has required structure, no factual errors, working links, and a substantive "Relation to Site Perspective" section.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Selection bias response too brief**: The original response (lines 109-111) simply said "this confuses explanation with observation" without engaging the objection's strength. *Resolution*: Expanded the response to acknowledge the objection has force while explaining why it doesn't fully dissolve the puzzle, using an anthropic analogy.

- **Quantum interface claims insufficiently hedged**: The section presented consciousness influencing quantum outcomes as if established. *Resolution*: Added "speculatively" and "If this hypothesis is correct" framing, plus explicit acknowledgment that "this remains a philosophical proposal rather than established science."

- **MWI self-locating uncertainty defense not engaged**: The article dismissed MWI without addressing the self-locating uncertainty response. *Resolution*: Added a paragraph explaining the MWI defense via self-locating uncertainty before providing the Map's response, making the rejection more dialectically fair.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Heterophenomenological challenge** (Dennett): The "lived reality" of indexicality might be a representation rather than a metaphysical fact. *Addressed*: Partially through the strengthened selection bias response and the new no-self objection.

- **Self-locating uncertainty** (Deutsch, Carroll): Uncertainty about which branch you're in is coherent even when all branches exist. *Addressed*: Added explicit engagement with this defense in the many-worlds branching section.

- **Buddhist no-self challenge** (Nagarjuna): The self that the question presupposes may be empty. *Addressed*: Added new objection "No self to locate" with response acknowledging force while noting the indexical puzzle remains even for processes.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear opening distinction between vertiginous question, hard problem, and personal identity over time
- Effective phenomenological writing that induces the vertiginous feeling
- List's argument against third-personal metaphysics
- Point that self-locating beliefs presuppose rather than explain indexical facts
- Comprehensive connection to all five tenets

### Enhancements Made
- Added connection to moral responsibility in the "Connections to Other Problems" section
- Expanded objections section with substantive Buddhist/eliminativist challenge
- Strengthened quantum section with appropriate hedging
- More fair engagement with MWI before rejection

### Cross-links Added
- [[moral-responsibility]] (added to concepts in frontmatter and discussed in text)

## Remaining Items

None. All identified medium issues were addressed. The article is now more dialectically rigorous while preserving its distinctive phenomenological voice.

## Stability Notes

The following represent bedrock philosophical disagreements rather than fixable flaws:

- **MWI defenders will continue to find the indexical objection question-begging**: They hold that self-locating uncertainty is coherent under branching; the Map holds it isn't. This is a fundamental disagreement about what indexical facts are, not a gap in the article's reasoning.

- **Eliminativists will continue to find the question meaningless**: From a perspective that denies substantial selves, the vertiginous question presupposes what it should prove. The article now engages this challenge directly rather than ignoring it.

- **Empiricists may still find haecceity empirically vacuous**: The article treats haecceity as potentially primitive. This is a defensible position but won't satisfy those who demand empirical criteria for theoretical entities.

Future reviews should NOT re-flag these as critical issues. They represent the expected philosophical standoffs between the Map's position and its critics.
