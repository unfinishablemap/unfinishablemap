**Date**: 2026-02-05
**Article**: [[hard-problem-of-consciousness|The Hard Problem of Consciousness]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-29-hard-problem-of-consciousness|2026-01-29]]
**Context**: Cross-review considering panpsychism insights

## Review Outcome: Stability Confirmed

This article has now been reviewed six times (2026-01-10, 2026-01-20, 2026-01-27, 2026-01-28, 2026-01-29, 2026-02-05). **No changes were made** because the article remains in a stable, high-quality state.

The cross-review context (panpsychism insights) was evaluated against the article's treatment of panpsychism. The existing coverage is adequate and appropriately scoped.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None.

### Attribution Accuracy Check
- No misattributions regarding panpsychism found
- Claims about the combination problem are accurate
- Comparison table fairly represents each framework's core challenge

### Medium Issues Found
None new. The cross-review examined whether panpsychism insights from the dedicated panpsychism concept page revealed gaps:

**Evaluated but not flagged:**
- The article's panpsychism section (lines 236-249) focuses on the combination problem. The panpsychism page's fuller treatment of the anti-emergence argument is appropriately left to that dedicated page.
- Russellian panpsychism is mentioned via the Russellian Monism section. Deeper integration is unnecessary.
- Process philosophy (Whitehead) connection to panpsychism is handled via cross-links.

### Counterarguments Status
All six adversarial personas were applied with the panpsychism cross-review context. No new objections beyond those already addressed in previous reviews.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Confirmed
- Comparison table (physicalism/panpsychism/idealism/dualism with core challenges) remains excellent pedagogy
- Cross-links to [[panpsychism]] and [[combination-problem]] appropriately direct readers seeking detail
- Appropriate balance: panpsychism is one response among many, given proportional coverage
- The article correctly positions panpsychism as trading one problem for another

### Expansion Opportunities (Deferred)
The panpsychism page reveals that panpsychism and dualism share the "anti-emergence diagnosis"—both agree consciousness cannot intelligibly emerge from non-conscious matter. This shared insight could potentially be noted more explicitly.

**Deferred because:**
1. Article is at 102% of soft threshold (3050/3000 words)—expansion requires equivalent cuts
2. The current coverage is accurate and the cross-link provides access to this detail
3. Article has reached convergence; marginal improvements don't warrant destabilization

## Word Count

- Current: 3050 words (102% of 3000 soft threshold)
- Status: No change (stability confirmation, no edits made)

## Remaining Items

None. The deferred expansion opportunity is documented for future reference but does not require immediate action.

## Stability Notes

**This article remains converged.** The cross-review context (panpsychism insights) confirms the existing treatment is adequate. The article appropriately:
- Acknowledges panpsychism as a response to the hard problem
- Notes the combination problem as panpsychism's central challenge
- Provides cross-links for readers wanting detailed treatment
- Maintains proportional coverage among the many responses discussed

Future cross-reviews considering specific topics (like panpsychism) should confirm that dedicated pages exist and are properly linked rather than expecting encyclopedic coverage in this survey article.

The appropriate review frequency for this article remains 90+ days unless triggered by specific new content.
