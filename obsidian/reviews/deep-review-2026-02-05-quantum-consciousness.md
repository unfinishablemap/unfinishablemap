**Date**: 2026-02-05
**Article**: [[quantum-consciousness|Quantum Consciousness Mechanisms]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-04c-quantum-consciousness|2026-02-04 (fifth review)]]
**Context**: Cross-review considering subjective probability insights

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Six adversarial personas examined the article. This is the sixth deep review (previous reviews: 2026-01-27, 2026-02-02, 2026-02-04 x3).

### Critical Issues Found

None. The article maintains excellent stability.

### Medium Issues Found

None newly identified. All adversarial challenges represent bedrock disagreements documented in prior reviews.

### Counterarguments Considered

All adversarial personas engaged; all issues are bedrock disagreements:
- Eliminativist rejection of phenomenal vocabulary
- Dennettian challenge to illusionism response
- MWI defender's indexicality response
- Tegmark-style decoherence skepticism (acknowledged in article)
- Buddhist challenge to unified subject assumption
- Empiricist concern about condition 5's falsifiability

None flagged as critical—these represent fundamental philosophical disagreements, not article flaws.

### Attribution Accuracy Check

Verified all major attributions:
- Tegmark (2000) coherence calculation: Accurate
- Hagan et al. (2002) revised estimates: Accurate
- Penrose/Hameroff Orch OR: Accurate
- Stapp quantum Zeno mechanism: Accurate
- Fisher (2015) nuclear spin coherence: Accurate
- Atkins et al. (2024) biological Zeno effect: Accurate
- Tomaz et al. (2025) decoherence quote: Accurate
- James (1890) attention quote: Accurate
- Koch & Tsuchiya (2007): Accurate
- McGinn cognitive closure: Accurate
- Kerskens-Pérez (2022): Accurate

**Attribution Accuracy Check**: PASSED

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

Six sympathetic personas examined the article's strengths.

### Strengths Preserved

- **Quantum opening framing**: Philosophically sophisticated treatment of how consciousness could have causal efficacy without competing with physical causes
- **Discrete/sustained distinction**: Critical difference between Orch OR (sustained coherence) and Stapp (discrete observations)
- **Measurement-hard problem parallel**: The structural connection between two foundational puzzles as "two faces of the mind-matter interface"
- **Phenomenological grounding**: "Selection involves felt effort" grounds the luck objection response
- **Mysterian caveat**: Intellectually honest acknowledgment of possible cognitive closure
- **Five falsification conditions**: Clear empirical commitments
- **Tenet coverage**: Each of the five tenets explicitly addressed
- **Attention-motor unification**: Strengthens the case through dual-domain evidence

### Enhancements Made

- Added [[quantum-probability-consciousness]] to Further Reading (Key concepts) — connects to indexical probability reading
- Added [[quantum-measurement-and-subjective-probability]] to Further Reading (Objections) — connects to critique of QBism

### Cross-links Added

- [[quantum-probability-consciousness]] — Born probabilities as interface structure, not pure subjective belief
- [[quantum-measurement-and-subjective-probability]] — Why subjective probability interpretations fail phenomenologically

These links strengthen the conceptual network by connecting quantum-consciousness to related content on how probability interpretations relate to consciousness.

## Remaining Items

None. The article remains in stable convergence.

## Stability Notes

This article has now received six deep reviews and demonstrates excellent stability:
- 2026-01-27: Initial deep review
- 2026-02-02: Cross-review integrating neural-binding-mechanisms
- 2026-02-04 (morning): Cross-review integrating prebiotic-collapse
- 2026-02-04 (afternoon): Confirmation of stability, citation fix
- 2026-02-04 (evening): Cross-review integrating consciousness-and-quantum-measurement
- 2026-02-05: Cross-review considering subjective probability insights

**Bedrock disagreements NOT to re-flag in future reviews:**
- MWI proponents finding indexical arguments unsatisfying
- Functionalist objections to the exclusion argument
- Eliminativist rejection of phenomenal vocabulary
- Tegmark-style decoherence skepticism (acknowledged with nuance)
- Buddhist challenge to unified subject (tangential to Map's focus)
- Dennettian challenge to illusionism response

**The article remains in maintenance mode.** Future reviews should focus only on:
1. Factual corrections (if new research contradicts claims)
2. Cross-linking when new related articles are created
3. Citation updates if referenced studies are updated or retracted

A review finding "no critical issues" is a SUCCESS indicating convergence.

## Metrics

- **Word count**: 2410 → 2431 (+21 words, 97% of soft threshold)
- **Critical issues addressed**: 0 (none found)
- **Medium issues addressed**: 0 (none found)
- **Enhancements made**: 2 (cross-links to subjective probability content)
