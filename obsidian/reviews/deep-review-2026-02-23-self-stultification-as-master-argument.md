**Date**: 2026-02-23
**Article**: [[self-stultification-as-master-argument|Self-Stultification as Master Argument]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article is well-structured with no factual errors, attribution problems, or internal contradictions. All attributions checked (Sellars, Churchland, tenets quotation) are accurate.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Six uncited references**: Anscombe, Huxley, James, Lewis, Plantinga, and Reppert were in References but never cited in body text. Resolution: Added historical lineage paragraph citing all six, contextualising the argument's tradition.
- **Table entry unclear**: Physicalism row in "Why the Pattern Repeats" table said "Normative relationships → causal efficacy" which was ambiguous. Resolution: Changed to "Rational norms → belief causation" for consistency with other entries.

### Low Issues Noted
- Pyrrhonist characterisation ("acts on the basis of beliefs they officially refuse to endorse") is contested — Pyrrhonists claimed they act on appearances without beliefs. Legitimate philosophical interpretation, not a factual error.
- Sellars "space of reasons" framing blends original terminology with McDowell's later elaboration. Acceptable for a synthesis piece.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Functionalist/identity theory response**: Physicalists who identify consciousness with brain activity might claim they don't "sever" consciousness from reasoning. Already implicitly addressed in the article ("The physicalist either identifies consciousness with brain activity...or reduces it to functional roles. Either way..."). Full treatment belongs in the argument-from-reason article.
- **Sophisticated eliminativist escape**: Eliminativists claim they can reformulate in non-folk-psychological terms. Already addressed via the "retreat" paragraph which notes this concedes the key point.
- **Pyrrhonist avoidance**: Pyrrhonians avoided assertion rather than making self-refuting claims. Acknowledged in the article as "intellectually honest but practically empty."

## Attribution Accuracy Check

All checks passed:
- Sellars "space of reasons" — correctly attributed to 1956 paper ✓
- Churchland eliminative materialism — correctly attributed to 1981 paper ✓
- Tenets quotation — correctly identified as Map's tenets ✓
- No misattributions, dropped qualifiers, overstated positions, or source/Map conflation found

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening paragraph: confident, comprehensive, immediately states core claim
- Three-step pattern formulation: clear and accessible
- Four varied verbs ("defeats, undermines, dissolves, destabilises") — effective rhetorical variety
- Summary table in "Why the Pattern Repeats" — crystallises the pattern
- Performative Dimension section — the article's most distinctive contribution
- Scope and Limits section — admirable intellectual honesty about the AI exception and the gap between self-stultification and refutation
- Tenet connections — clear about what self-stultification supports and what it doesn't

### Enhancements Made
- Added historical lineage paragraph tracing Lewis → Anscombe → Plantinga → Reppert tradition, with Huxley → James epiphenomenalism thread
- Clarified physicalism table entry for precision

### Cross-links Added
None needed — article was already well-linked throughout body text.

## Remaining Items

None. All identified improvements have been addressed.

## Stability Notes

This is the first review. The article was well-structured and philosophically sound from the start. Changes were minor:

- The historical paragraph adds context without changing the argument
- The table clarification is cosmetic

Future reviews should NOT re-flag:
- "Functionalists disagree that physical causation can't track norms" — This is a bedrock philosophical disagreement central to the argument from reason; the detailed response belongs in that article, not here
- "Pyrrhonists would characterise their practice differently" — Legitimate philosophical disagreement about Pyrrhonism, not a factual error
- "Eliminativists have sophisticated responses" — The retreat paragraph already handles this
- "Identity theory escapes the pattern" — Implicitly addressed; the normative dimension argument applies regardless of whether consciousness is identified with or distinct from brain activity
