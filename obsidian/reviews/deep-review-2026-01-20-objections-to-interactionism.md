# Deep Review: Objections to Interactionist Dualism

**Date**: 2026-01-20
**File**: `concepts/objections-to-interactionism.md`
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Missing decoherence objection**: The article discussed five objections but omitted the decoherence objection, which specifically targets The Unfinishable Map's quantum-based interactionism. This is a major gap since decoherence is the primary empirical challenge to quantum consciousness theories.
  - **Resolution**: Added comprehensive new "The Decoherence Objection" section with four distinct responses (revised calculations, quantum biology evidence, measurement problem, non-computational selection).

### Medium Issues Found
- **No falsifiability discussion**: The article presented responses to objections but didn't discuss what would challenge or falsify interactionism, leaving it potentially unfalsifiable.
  - **Resolution**: Added new "What Would Challenge This View?" section with four testable conditions.

- **MWI challenge unaddressed**: The Many-Worlds interpretation provides a distinct challenge—if all outcomes occur, "selection" is illusory. This wasn't engaged.
  - **Resolution**: Added MWI confirmation as one of the falsifiability conditions; strengthened connection to site's No Many Worlds tenet.

- **Luck objection connection missing**: There's a structural parallel between the exclusion argument and the luck objection that wasn't exploited.
  - **Resolution**: Added "Connection to the Luck Objection" subsection showing parallel structure and unified response.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminativist challenge**: The article assumes consciousness exists as described—eliminativists would question this. Not fully addressed but the parsimony section partially responds.
- **Tegmark's calculations**: Now explicitly engaged with revised calculation response.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear summary table format at end (enhanced with new row)
- Strong articulation of the quantum insufficiency response to exclusion argument
- Excellent engagement with Kim's specific formulations
- Effective use of the evolutionary argument as *supporting* interactionism
- Well-integrated "Relation to Site Perspective" section
- Good historical examples for Occam's Razor Has Limits (heliocentrism, atoms, QM)

### Enhancements Made
1. Added comprehensive decoherence objection section (~600 words)
2. Added falsifiability/testability section (~300 words)
3. Strengthened haecceity cross-link in pairing problem section
4. Added luck-objection connection to exclusion argument
5. Updated summary table from 5 to 6 objections
6. Expanded Further Reading with 4 new entries
7. Added 4 new concept cross-links in frontmatter
8. Added Tegmark (2000) and Kerskens & Pérez (2022-2023) references

### Cross-links Added
- [[decoherence]] — major new section
- [[haecceity]] — strengthened existing mention
- [[pairing-problem]] — added to frontmatter and opening
- [[luck-objection]] — new subsection connection
- [[many-worlds]] — added to Further Reading
- [[measurement-problem]] — cross-linked in decoherence section

## Remaining Items

None. All critical and medium issues addressed.
