**Date**: 2026-02-05
**Article**: [[brain-interface-boundary|Brain Interface Boundary: Why Consciousness Acts Only Here]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-27-brain-interface-boundary|2026-01-27]]
**Context**: Cross-review considering new [[brain-specialness-boundary]] article

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Six adversarial personas examined the article in light of the new companion piece:

### Critical Issues Found
- None identified

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Missing cross-link to brain-specialness-boundary**: The article didn't reference the new companion piece that approaches the same problem from a different angle (the "embarrassment objection" framing).
   - **Resolution**: Added cross-link in related_articles frontmatter, in Further Reading, and an inline reference where PK research is discussed.

### Issues Previously Addressed (Not Re-Flagged)
Per the previous review's stability notes, the following were NOT re-flagged:
- Eliminativist objection (bedrock disagreement)
- MWI objection (explicit tenet commitment)
- Quantum skepticism (article acknowledges disputed status)
- Functionalist challenge (acknowledged, deferred to [[illusionism]])

### Cross-Article Analysis
The two articles cover overlapping territory from complementary angles:
- **brain-interface-boundary**: "Why brains?" (five positive criteria) + "Why only brains?" (four constraints)
- **brain-specialness-boundary**: "Why not psychokinesis?" (addresses embarrassment objection directly)

The overlap is acceptable—they serve different entry points for readers. Cross-linking improves discoverability.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
1. The five criteria framework remains elegant and principled
2. The four boundary constraints follow logically from mechanism
3. The Permits/Excludes tables provide clear predictions
4. The Process Philosophy Perspective offers unique theoretical depth
5. The pairing problem integration (Criterion 5) is strong
6. The "What Would Challenge This View" section shows intellectual honesty
7. The Evolutionary Angle presents two options without forcing commitment

### Enhancements Made
1. Added cross-link to [[brain-specialness-boundary]] in related_articles frontmatter
2. Added brief inline reference to brain-specialness-boundary in the PK section
3. Added brain-specialness-boundary as first item in Further Reading

### Cross-links Added
- [[brain-specialness-boundary]] (inline and Further Reading)

## Length Analysis

- **Before**: 3018 words (121% of 2500 soft threshold)
- **After**: ~3040 words (122% of 2500 soft threshold)
- **Change**: +~22 words (cross-link additions)

Operating in length-neutral mode but accepted minimal word increase for essential cross-linking. The additions are low-overhead (one parenthetical, one Further Reading entry).

## Remaining Items

None. The cross-review task is complete. The articles now link to each other appropriately.

## Stability Notes

All stability notes from the previous review remain in effect:

1. **Eliminativist objection**: Bedrock disagreement consistent with tenets
2. **MWI objection**: Explicit No Many Worlds tenet commitment
3. **Quantum skepticism**: Article acknowledges disputed empirical status
4. **Functionalist challenge**: Deferred to dedicated [[illusionism]] article

**New note**: The relationship between brain-interface-boundary and brain-specialness-boundary is now established. Future reviews should NOT flag the overlap as redundancy—the articles serve different purposes (positive criteria vs. embarrassment objection).
