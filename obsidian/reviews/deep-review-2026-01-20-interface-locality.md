## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Missing decoherence engagement**: No response to Tegmark's (2000) calculation that neural quantum coherence decays in ~10⁻¹³ seconds. Resolution: Added comprehensive "The Decoherence Challenge" section with four response strategies (revised calculations, 2024 experimental evidence, alternative mechanisms, quantum Zeno sidestep).
- **Missing falsifiability section**: Article lacked explicit conditions for refutation. Resolution: Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section with five specific falsifiability conditions.

### Medium Issues Found
- **No illusionist engagement**: Article assumed phenomenal consciousness exists without addressing Frankish/Dennett challenge. Resolution: Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section showing locality constraints apply whether consciousness is real or illusory.
- **Missing process philosophy perspective**: No engagement with Whitehead's framework. Resolution: Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section explaining why actual occasions are inherently local.
- **Sparse cross-linking**: Missing connections to recently reviewed content. Resolution: Added 5 new concepts to frontmatter (attention-as-interface, illusionism, decoherence, introspection, voluntary-attention) and 4 new entries to Further Reading.

### Counterarguments Considered
- Illusionism (Frankish/Dennett): Addressed with argument that illusion-generating processes face same locality constraints
- Decoherence (Tegmark): Addressed with four-point response including 2024 experimental evidence
- Testability objection: Strengthened response with explicit link to falsifiability conditions
- Process philosophy framing: Added Whitehead perspective showing why locality is metaphysically necessary

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear four-part boundary condition framework
- Strong integration of Stapp's Process 1 model
- Honest engagement with parapsychology debate
- Principled (not ad hoc) mechanism for brain-restriction
- Effective table summarizing permitted vs excluded effects

### Enhancements Made
- Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section (~250 words)
- Added "The Decoherence Challenge" section (~300 words)
- Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section (~200 words)
- Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section (~200 words)
- Expanded References section with 6 academic citations
- Updated testability objection response to reference falsifiability section

### Cross-links Added
- [[attention-as-interface]]
- [[illusionism]]
- [[decoherence]]
- [[introspection]]
- [[voluntary-attention]]
