## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The first review (2026-02-10) resolved all critical factual issues (unverifiable table data, cherry-picked reading rate, optic nerve figure, Schwartz interpretation conflation). No new critical issues identified.

### Medium Issues Found

- **Missing cross-link to bandwidth-problem-mental-causation**: The companion concept article (created 2026-02-23) directly addresses the specification challenge the bandwidth constraint creates for mental causation, but the topic article had no reference to it. **Resolution**: Added to concepts frontmatter, added paragraph in body text linking the bandwidth constraint to the specification challenge, added to Further Reading.

- **Missing cross-links to related articles**: mental-causation, conservation-laws-and-mind, and downward-causation were absent despite thematic relevance. **Resolution**: Added to related_articles frontmatter and Further Reading section.

- **Unsupported derivation phrasing**: "binary-to-quaternary choice complexity" was flagged in the previous review as lacking citation and remained unfixed. **Resolution**: Replaced with "with each selection choosing among a small set of alternatives"—still approximate but no longer claims a specific unsupported complexity range.

### Counterarguments Considered

All six adversarial personas engaged. No new counterarguments beyond those identified in the 2026-02-10 review:

- **Eliminative Materialist**: "Conscious processing rate" conflates behavioral output with consciousness. Bedrock disagreement—the article acknowledges GWT's architectural explanation.
- **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: CEO analogy smuggles in a homunculus. Acknowledged as analogy, not argument. Previous review preserved as strength.
- **Quantum Skeptic**: Bandwidth-to-quantum connection is not entailed by the data alone. Article argues constraint rather than proof. Bedrock disagreement.
- **Many-Worlds Defender**: Per-branch objection acknowledged in previous review's revision. No new issues.
- **Empiricist**: GWT dismissal criterion ("fully accounts for") could be sharper. Low priority—falsification section already praised.
- **Buddhist Philosopher**: "Conscious processing rate" presupposes a boundary between conscious/unconscious. Interesting but not a flaw in the article's framework.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Opening paragraph: quantitative, front-loaded, truncation-resilient
- The "factory with a million workers" analogy
- William James's prism analogy
- CEO analogy for the selection model
- "You cannot choose among options that haven't been prepared yet" — strongest single sentence
- "Constrained authorship" framing in free will section
- Falsification section with four specific conditions
- All five tenet connections
- Automatisation section's interface model reading
- Schwartz interpretation (properly qualified after first review)

### Enhancements Made

- Added paragraph connecting bandwidth constraint to the specification challenge (bandwidth-problem-mental-causation), showing the constraint is both evidence for and challenge to the interface model
- Added four new Further Reading entries (bandwidth-problem-mental-causation, mental-causation, conservation-laws-and-mind, downward-causation)
- Fixed unsupported "binary-to-quaternary" derivation phrasing
- Updated concepts and related_articles frontmatter

### Cross-links Added

- [[bandwidth-problem-mental-causation]]
- [[mental-causation]]
- [[conservation-laws-and-mind]]
- [[downward-causation]]

## Remaining Items

- The altered states prediction (psychedelics → richer experience) could benefit from a specific Carhart-Harris entropic brain citation. Currently references "neural entropy" findings without a formal citation. Low priority—the claim is qualified.
- Comparative bandwidth across species remains unexplored. This is an expansion opportunity for a future article rather than a gap in this one.
- The filter model makes no quantitative predictions distinguishing it from production models given the same data. This is an honest limitation flagged in the previous review. The article doesn't need to solve this—it's a known open question for filter theory generally.

## Stability Notes

- This article is approaching stability. The first review (2026-02-10) addressed all factual errors and strengthened engagement with counterarguments. This second review found no critical issues and made targeted enhancements: connecting to the newly created companion concept page and adding cross-links.
- All six adversarial persona disagreements are bedrock philosophical standoffs, not fixable issues. Future reviews should NOT re-flag: eliminativist skepticism of "conscious processing" as a category, GWT sufficiency claims, quantum mechanism skepticism, MWI per-branch objection, or the homunculus concern with the CEO analogy.
- The bandwidth-problem-mental-causation connection is now bidirectional (topic links to concept and vice versa). Future reviews should check this linkage is maintained if either article is modified.
