# Deep Review: Moral Responsibility

**Date**: 2026-01-30
**File**: obsidian/concepts/moral-responsibility.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-20

## Context

This article was previously reviewed on 2026-01-20 when it was first created. That review addressed several critical issues including adding Illusionist Challenge, Decoherence Challenge, and "What Would Challenge This View?" sections. Since then, the article was condensed from 4322 to 2063 words (2026-01-26) and a meta description was added.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The previous review addressed all critical structural issues, and the condensation preserved the essential content.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Unsourced 60% predictive accuracy claim**: The falsifiability section cited "~60% for simple choices" without attribution.
   - **Resolution**: Added "in studies like Soon et al. 2008" inline reference and added Soon et al. (2008) to References section.

### Counterarguments Considered

The article already engages well with:
- Illusionist challenge to effort phenomenology (dedicated section)
- Decoherence objection to quantum mechanism (dedicated section)
- Buddhist no-self challenge to agent causation (in Objections section)
- Compatibilist sufficiency argument (in Objections section)

Personas reviewed:
1. **Eliminative Materialist**: Would reject folk-psychological "desert" but this is bedrock disagreement with Map tenets
2. **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: Compatibilism dismissal could be more nuanced, but Objections section addresses this
3. **Quantum Skeptic**: Decoherence challenge is honestly acknowledged with appropriate hedging
4. **Many-Worlds Defender**: MWI ethics discussion is thin but represents bedrock disagreement with tenet #4
5. **Empiricist**: Falsifiability conditions are well-stated; 60% claim now sourced
6. **Buddhist Philosopher**: Response to Buddhist objection is fair and substantive

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Clear opening summary distinguishing pragmatic vs metaphysical desert
- Well-structured objections and responses section
- Strong phenomenology of effort treatment linking experience to causal engagement
- Honest engagement with illusionist and decoherence challenges
- Good falsifiability conditions section
- Appropriate references to fuller treatments in linked articles (e.g., [[quantum-indeterminacy-free-will]], [[illusionism]], [[decoherence]])
- Concise prose after successful condensation

### Enhancements Made

1. **Added Soon et al. (2008) citation** for 60% predictive accuracy claim
2. **Added full reference** to References section

### Cross-links Present

Extensive cross-linking already in place:
- [[agent-causation]], [[mental-causation]], [[interactionist-dualism]]
- [[illusionism]], [[introspection]], [[decoherence]]
- [[quantum-biology]], [[measurement-problem]]
- [[witness-consciousness]], [[buddhism-and-dualism]]
- [[haecceity]], [[tenets]]

## Remaining Items

None. The article is in good condition.

## Stability Notes

This article has reached stability after two deep reviews and one condensation pass. The following represent bedrock philosophical disagreements rather than fixable problems:

1. **Eliminativist challenge**: Eliminative materialists will reject "desert" as folk psychology—this is expected given the Map's tenet #1 (Dualism).

2. **MWI and ethics**: Many-Worlds defenders will argue desert survives in their framework—this is expected given tenet #4 (No Many Worlds).

3. **Compatibilist sufficiency**: Compatibilists will argue their framework suffices for moral practice—the Objections section engages this fairly.

Future reviews should NOT re-flag these as critical issues. The article honestly engages with these positions and takes a clear stance aligned with the Map's tenets.

## Word Count

2063 words (83% of 2500 soft threshold for concepts) - no length issues.
