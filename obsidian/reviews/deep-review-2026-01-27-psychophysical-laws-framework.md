# Deep Review: The Psychophysical Laws Framework

**Date**: 2026-01-27
**File**: obsidian/topics/psychophysical-laws-framework.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-26
**Context**: Cross-review considering new [[chalmers-psychophysical-coupling]] article

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Six adversarial personas evaluated the article:

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article has all required sections, no factual errors detected, and no internal contradictions.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Missing cross-link to Chalmers coupling article**: The new [[chalmers-psychophysical-coupling]] article covers Chalmers' 2022 work with McQueen in detail. This framework article referenced the 2022 paper but didn't point to the detailed treatment. **Resolution**: Added cross-link in opening paragraph, related_articles frontmatter, and Further Reading section.

### Low Issues Found
1. **Quantum skeptic notes decoherence framing**: Phrase "the debate is ongoing" may overstate active controversy. However, this was already addressed in the 2026-01-26 review—the current framing appropriately acknowledges mainstream consensus while noting the debate.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminativist challenge**: Presupposes hard problem is genuine. **Status**: Tenet-level commitment (stability note from previous review).
- **MWI challenge**: Could develop why indexical uncertainty is unsatisfying. **Status**: Low priority; the point is made, and extensive development would shift focus from the article's core content.
- **Buddhist challenge**: Framework assumes substantial self. **Status**: Alternative metaphysical framework (stability note from previous review).

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

Six sympathetic personas evaluated the article:

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear upward-downward asymmetry framing distinguishes Chalmers' work from Map's extension
- Accurate treatment of Chalmers' three bridging principles
- Phenomenologically grounded discussion of mental variables (attention, intention, effort, valence)
- Strong "What Would Challenge This View?" section (added in previous review)
- Well-developed specification problem discussion with three response options
- Appropriate balance between presenting existing work and Map's extensions

### Enhancements Made
1. **Added cross-link to [[chalmers-psychophysical-coupling]]**: Now referenced in opening paragraph as companion to the concept page
2. **Updated Further Reading section**: Reordered to put Chalmers coupling article first with accurate description
3. **Updated related_articles frontmatter**: Added [[chalmers-psychophysical-coupling]] as related article

### Cross-links Added
- [[chalmers-psychophysical-coupling]] (opening paragraph, related_articles, Further Reading)

## Remaining Items

None. The cross-review integration with the Chalmers coupling article is complete.

## Stability Notes

The following represent fundamental philosophical disagreements rather than fixable problems (carried forward from 2026-01-26 review):

- **Eliminativist critique**: The article assumes the hard problem is genuine. This is a Map tenet, not a flaw. Future reviews should not re-flag this.
- **MWI proponent critique**: The rejection of many-worlds is central to the Map's framework. This is a tenet-level commitment.
- **Buddhist/process critique**: The article treats consciousness as a substance with causal powers. Alternative frameworks (dependent arising, actual occasions) are valid philosophical options but the Map's framework is internally consistent on its own terms.

## Word Count

- Before: 2275 words (76% of 3000 threshold)
- After: 2284 words (76% of 3000 threshold)
- Change: +9 words (minor cross-link additions)

## Convergence Assessment

This article has now been reviewed twice (2026-01-26 and 2026-01-27). The second review found:
- No critical issues
- Only one medium issue (missing cross-link to new companion article)
- No changes to core content or arguments

**Status**: Article is approaching stability. Future reviews should only be triggered by:
1. New related content requiring integration
2. Significant modifications to the article itself
3. Changes to referenced materials (e.g., if the Chalmers coupling article is significantly revised)
