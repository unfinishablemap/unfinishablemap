**Date**: 2026-02-17
**Article**: [[consciousness-and-moral-agency-under-duress|Consciousness and Moral Agency Under Duress]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

- **Missing References section**: Article made several attributable claims (Aristotle on compulsion, Frankfurt-style cases, tunnel vision, torture survivor testimony) without citations. Resolution: Added References section with Aristotle, Frankfurt (1969), Morgan et al. (2004), and Stockdale (1984).

- **Missing engagement with No Many Worlds and Occam's Razor tenets**: Relation to Site Perspective only covered 3 of 5 tenets. Resolution: Added paragraphs connecting both remaining tenets — MWI dissolves moral responsibility into branch-counting; Occam's Razor has limits when simplicity requires denying causal efficacy of conscious effort.

- **Frankfurt-style cases dangling thread**: The Standard Debate section introduced Frankfurt cases and claimed the Map "cuts through these puzzles differently" but never explained how. Resolution: Replaced with explicit resolution — the Map's agent-causation framework sidesteps Frankfurt by focusing on whether consciousness performed the selection, not whether the agent could have done otherwise.

### Medium Issues Found

- **Unsupported "no consistent neural predictor" claim**: Original text asserted variation in torture responses with "no consistent neural predictor" — likely false given resilience research. Resolution: Rewritten to acknowledge identified predictors (trait conscientiousness, prefrontal-amygdala connectivity, prior conditioning) while noting substantial residual variance. Cited Morgan et al. (2004).

- **Unsupported volitional opacity claim**: Original stated torture survivors "often report" inability to explain resistance without sourcing. Resolution: Qualified with attribution to POW accounts and cited Stockdale (1984).

- **Explanatory redundancy unaddressed**: The graduated responsibility framework (temporal compression, phenomenal overwhelm, option space, prior preparation) is entirely compatible with physicalism. Article never engaged with this strongest counterargument. Resolution: Added "Why Not a Physicalist Account?" section addressing this directly — the difference emerges at the veto, where physicalism must render felt effort causally inert.

- **Missing cross-links**: Added links to reasons-responsiveness, consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns, luck-objection, suffering-versus-pain, spontaneous-intentional-action.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Explanatory redundancy** (physicalist graduated responsibility): Addressed in new "Why Not a Physicalist Account?" section. The veto case distinguishes the accounts — physicalism makes felt effort epiphenomenal.

- **Luck objection under duress**: Addressed in new section — under duress the phenomenological contrast between selection and randomness is maximally vivid.

- **Neural predictors of resilience**: Addressed by qualifying the empirical claim and citing Morgan et al. (2004), while noting residual variance as the Map's evidential foothold.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Core reframing of duress as test case for consciousness's causal efficacy
- Graduated responsibility taxonomy (four-factor model)
- Veto-under-duress argument as evidence for bidirectional interaction
- Agency vs. moral agency distinction (phenomenal overwhelm degrades moral-specific agency while general agency persists)
- Baseline cognition deployment for characterising cognitive regression under stress
- "Not because... but because" rhetorical construction in The Dualist Difference section

### Enhancements Made

- Resolved Frankfurt-style cases dangling thread with explicit agent-causation resolution
- Added "Why Not a Physicalist Account?" section engaging the explanatory redundancy objection
- Expanded Relation to Site Perspective to cover all five tenets
- Qualified empirical claims with citations
- Replaced colloquial "merely along for the ride" with precise "causally inert"
- Added References section with 4 citations

### Cross-links Added

- [[reasons-responsiveness]] (in Standard Debate section)
- [[consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns]] (in Coercion and the Veto Power section)
- [[luck-objection]] (in Why Not a Physicalist Account section)
- [[suffering-versus-pain]] (in Further Reading)
- [[spontaneous-intentional-action]] (in Further Reading)

## Remaining Items

- **Phenomenal overflow connection**: The optimistic review suggested connecting "phenomenal overwhelm" to Block's phenomenal overflow concept (moral qualia drowned rather than eliminated). Deferred — would add interesting depth but the article is functioning well without it.

- **Process-philosophical framing**: Whitehead's "intensity of experience" could deepen the account of why duress reduces moral agency. Deferred — would require substantial addition and the current phenomenological framing is effective.

- **Choking phenomenon connection**: The choking literature is directly relevant (stress-induced self-monitoring paralleling moral-agency degradation). Deferred — would require a new subsection.

## Stability Notes

- The six adversarial personas predictably disagree with the dualist framework. The eliminative materialist and quantum skeptic find the quantum-selection mechanism ungrounded; the Buddhist philosopher rejects the substantial self. These are bedrock philosophical disagreements, not fixable problems. Future reviews should not re-flag "materialists disagree with dualism" or "Buddhists reject the self" as critical issues.

- The explanatory redundancy objection (physicalist graduated responsibility) is now explicitly addressed. Future reviews should evaluate whether the response is adequate, not re-raise the objection as if unacknowledged.

- The empirical claims about torture resistance and volitional opacity are now qualified and cited. The citations (Morgan et al. 2004, Stockdale 1984) are representative but not exhaustive. Future reviews should not demand additional citations unless the existing ones are shown to be inaccurate or insufficient.
