**Date**: 2026-02-25
**Article**: [[downward-causation|Downward Causation]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-26-downward-causation|2026-01-26]]

## Context

Since the last review (2026-01-26), the article underwent significant changes:
- Condensed from 3562 to 2396 words (condense skill)
- Refined decoherence timing gap discussion
- Affected by coalesce operations (psychophysical law articles merged, substance-causation merged into agent-causation)
- SEO descriptions added
- Bare wikilinks qualified for colliding slugs

Current word count: 2427 words (97% of 2500 soft threshold).

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Broken wikilink to psychophysical-laws-framework**: Line 40 referenced `[[psychophysical-laws-framework|psychophysical laws]]` but this file no longer exists — it was merged into `psychophysical-laws-bridging-mind-and-matter` by the coalesce operation. The body text was missed when Further Reading was updated.
   - **Resolution**: Changed to `[[psychophysical-laws|psychophysical laws]]` (the concept page, appropriate for an inline terminology reference).

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Missing Tallis reference**: The illusionism section (line 155) quotes Raymond Tallis by name ("Misrepresentation presupposes presentation") without a corresponding entry in the References section. Per writing style guide, attributed claims must be verifiable from cited sources.
   - **Resolution**: Added Tallis, R. (2024) to References section.

### Counterarguments Considered

All six adversarial personas engaged. No new substantive issues identified beyond what previous reviews covered:
- Eliminativist folk-category objection: addressed by self-stultification argument
- Physicalist heterophenomenology: addressed by illusionism engagement
- Decoherence timing: honestly presented with acknowledged gaps
- MWI: explicitly flagged as tenet dependency
- Empiricist testability: five falsification conditions provided
- Buddhist non-dual critique: outside article scope

## Attribution Accuracy Check

- Campbell 1974 introduction of term: correctly attributed
- Kim 2005 exclusion argument: correctly attributed, fairly presented
- Tegmark 2000 decoherence (~10^-13 seconds): consistent with other site articles
- Hameroff revised estimates (7 orders of magnitude): consistent with decoherence concept page
- Bandwidth (~10 bits/second): consistent across 5+ site articles
- Tallis "Misrepresentation presupposes presentation": correctly attributed, reference now added
- O'Connor-Wong emergentism: fairly characterized as "naming the problem more than solving it"
- No misattribution, dropped qualifiers, or source/Map conflation detected

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Excellent front-loaded opening paragraph connecting to Kim's exclusion and the Map's framework
- Fair, clear presentation of Kim's exclusion argument (premises laid out, conclusion drawn honestly)
- Honest decoherence discussion — acknowledges 3-order-of-magnitude gap without hand-waving
- Effective weak/strong downward causation distinction
- Well-structured comparison table (classical emergentism vs quantum interactionism)
- Comprehensive falsifiability section with five concrete conditions
- Self-stultification argument against epiphenomenalism
- Bandwidth constraint framing (consciousness operates at policy level, not individual quantum events)
- "Research program, not completed theory" intellectual honesty

### Enhancements Made

1. Fixed broken wikilink to psychophysical-laws-framework → psychophysical-laws
2. Added Tallis (2024) reference for attributed quote

### Cross-links Verified

All 23 wikilinks verified against existing files. Only the psychophysical-laws-framework link was broken (now fixed). Further Reading section is comprehensive and accurate.

## Length Analysis

- **Before**: 2427 words (97% of 2500 soft threshold)
- **After**: ~2430 words (length-neutral — only added one reference line)
- **Mode**: Length-neutral

## Remaining Items

None. The article is well-structured and stable after its condensation and refinement cycle.

## Stability Notes

This is the third deep review (2026-01-20, 2026-01-26, 2026-02-25). The first two reviews addressed all major structural and argumentative issues. The intervening condensation (3562 → 2396 words) removed some secondary material (process philosophy alternative) but strengthened the core argument.

This review found only maintenance issues (broken link from coalesce operation, missing reference) rather than substantive content problems. The article has achieved convergence.

**Philosophical disagreements that should NOT be re-flagged as critical:**
- Eliminativists rejecting folk psychological framing — bedrock disagreement
- Physicists accepting Tegmark's decoherence calculations — article presents both sides honestly
- MWI proponents finding single-world requirement unsatisfying — acknowledged as tenet dependency
- Illusionists challenging the existence of phenomenal consciousness — addressed with regress argument

**The article has re-converged after its condensation cycle.** Future reviews should focus on broken links from site restructuring operations or factual errors, not philosophical engagement improvements.
