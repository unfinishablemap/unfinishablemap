**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Article**: [[leibnizs-mill-argument|Leibniz's Mill Argument]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-01-leibnizs-mill-argument|2026-02-01]]

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article was reviewed yesterday and remains in excellent condition.

### Medium Issues Found
None. Previous review addressed concerns about emergence response, computation analogy engagement, and intuition reliability caveat.

### Counterarguments Considered
All six adversarial personas were applied. No new critical issues emerged:
- **Eliminative Materialist**: Would reject the "perception" category entirely—acknowledged as bedrock disagreement
- **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: Computation analogy addressed adequately in previous revision
- **Quantum Skeptic**: Not directly relevant to this classical argument
- **Many-Worlds Defender**: Not directly engaged by mill argument
- **Empiricist**: Intuition reliability caveat already added
- **Buddhist Philosopher**: Subject/object duality critique is philosophical standoff, not fixable flaw

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Original Monadology quotation (§17) grounds article in primary source
- Clear four-step reconstruction of the argument structure
- Vivid phrasing: "Walk through the mill. Look around. Where is the experience?"
- Careful separation of Leibniz's own views from Map's position
- Effective connection to zombie argument and hard problem
- Strong materialist response section with emergence, computation, and knowledge objections

### Enhancements Made
This review focused on **orphan integration**—the article had no inbound links.

### Cross-links Added (to other articles)
Added links TO leibnizs-mill-argument FROM:
- [[phenomenal-unity]] — "Leibniz's Insight" section now links to full article
- [[arguments-for-dualism]] — Explanatory Gap section now mentions Leibniz's Mill
- [[explanatory-gap]] — Added paragraph connecting gap to Leibniz's anticipation
- [[dualism]] — Explanatory Gap section now references Leibniz's Mill
- [[history-of-interactionist-dualism]] — Leibniz Closure section now mentions the mill argument

## Word Count

Before: 1727 words (58% of 3000 threshold)
After: 1727 words (unchanged—article not modified, only linked to)

## Remaining Items

None. The article was already in stable condition from yesterday's review. This review focused exclusively on integration—creating inbound links from related articles.

## Stability Notes

The article has now reached stability after two reviews:
- Content quality was addressed in 2026-02-01 review
- Orphan status was addressed in this 2026-02-02 review

Future reviews should NOT re-flag the following as issues:
- **Eliminativists rejecting the "perception" category** — Bedrock disagreement
- **Dennettians preferring heterophenomenology** — Addressed via computation analogy response
- **Empiricists distrusting intuition-based arguments** — Caveat about intuition reliability addresses this

The article is now well-integrated into the site with 5 inbound links from key related articles.
