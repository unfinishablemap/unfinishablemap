# Tenet Alignment Check

**Date**: 2026-02-28
**Files checked**: 394
**Errors**: 0
**Warnings**: 1
**Notes**: 12

## Summary

Comprehensive scan of all 197 topics and 197 concepts for alignment with the five foundational tenets. The site is in excellent health — no direct contradictions found. One warning identifies a scope concern with consciousness's causal reach beyond minimal interaction. Twelve notes flag places where alternative philosophical frameworks receive sympathetic enough treatment that readers might mistake them for the Map's own position, though all flagged articles do ultimately state the Map's preferred stance.

The most common pattern across notes is sympathetic treatment of panexperientialism/panpsychism (Whitehead's process philosophy), which appears in multiple articles. While each article includes appropriate disclaimers, the cumulative effect across the site may warrant attention.

## Errors

None.

## Warnings

### consciousness-and-the-physics-of-information.md
- **Tenet**: Minimal Quantum Interaction
- **Issue**: The article's treatment of consciousness biasing quantum outcomes is presented alongside Wheeler's participatory framework in a way that suggests consciousness plays a role in *all* measurement events, not just neural ones. The sentence about "reality's informational content concentrates where conscious observers engage" echoes participatory-universe ideas that go beyond the minimal-interaction tenet, which restricts influence to the subject's own brain.
- **Quote**: "consciousness shapes reality through information without being reducible to it. The result is adaptive computational depth — reality's informational content concentrates where conscious observers engage"
- **Recommendation**: Add a clarifying note that the Map's position restricts conscious influence to the neural interface, not to measurement events generally. Distinguish clearly between the participatory-universe hypothesis (which the Map does not endorse) and the Map's minimal quantum interaction at the brain level.

## Notes

### animal-consciousness.md
- **Tenet**: Dualism
- **Issue**: The Process Philosophy section presents Whitehead's panexperientialism — "experience is fundamental — actual occasions of experience are reality's basic constituents" — in a tone more sympathetic than critical. The article does note that the Map "does not endorse panpsychism" and identifies the combination problem, but the section reads as implicitly positive toward a view in tension with the Map's interactionist dualism.
- **Quote**: "Whitehead's panexperientialism holds that experience is fundamental — actual occasions of experience are reality's basic constituents."
- **Recommendation**: Strengthen the note that panexperientialism, while interesting, conflicts with the Map's commitment to consciousness as irreducible and non-continuous with physical properties.

### consciousness-as-activity.md
- **Tenet**: Dualism
- **Issue**: Extended treatment of Whitehead's process philosophy where "experience is what actuality does, all the way down" leans toward panpsychism rather than the Map's dualism. The article notes it "does not commit the Map to full Whiteheadian metaphysics" but the framing is sympathetic enough to blur the line.
- **Quote**: "Human experience is highly organised activity of the same kind that, in simpler forms, constitutes all actuality."
- **Recommendation**: Clarify that the Map borrows the "consciousness as activity" framing without accepting the panexperientialist premise that all actuality is experiential.

### consciousness-in-simple-organisms.md
- **Tenet**: Dualism
- **Issue**: The Process Philosophy section presents the view that "experience didn't emerge from non-experience during evolution" with substantial sympathy. While disclaimers are present, the treatment gives panexperientialism enough weight that it could blur the Map's dualist distinction between physical and non-physical domains.
- **Quote**: "Experience didn't emerge from non-experience during evolution. Rather, evolution organised and amplified experiential properties that were always present at the fundamental level."
- **Recommendation**: Make the Map's disagreement with panexperientialism more prominent in this section.

### consciousness-and-the-physics-of-information.md
- **Tenet**: Dualism
- **Issue**: Chalmers's "double-aspect theory of information" is presented as "a neutral ground from which both aspects emerge," given sustained sympathetic treatment that sits in tension with the Map's substance dualism. The article does ultimately favor "information as interface" but the neutral monist reading receives considerable attention.
- **Quote**: "Chalmers's double-aspect approach treats information as the bridge between physical and phenomenal — a neutral ground from which both aspects emerge."
- **Recommendation**: Clarify that the Map views information as a medium of interaction between distinct domains, not as a neutral monist substrate.

### consciousness-in-smeared-quantum-states.md
- **Tenet**: No Many Worlds
- **Issue**: The Albert and Loewer "many-minds" framework is given extended, detailed treatment as one of five equally-presented frameworks. While the article explicitly notes "the Map rejects" this approach, the neutral presentation alongside other options somewhat normalizes the many-worlds picture.
- **Quote**: "Albert and Loewer's many-minds interpretation accepts that brains enter superposition but insists minds never do."
- **Recommendation**: Consider making the rejection of many-minds more prominent, or note at the framework's introduction that it conflicts with Tenet 4.

### cross-cultural-phenomenology-of-agency.md
- **Tenet**: Bidirectional Interaction
- **Issue**: The Buddhist view of "conditioned arising without an author" is presented with considerable sympathy. If conditioned arising without selection is a viable account of agency, bidirectional interaction (consciousness *selecting* outcomes) becomes optional rather than necessary.
- **Quote**: "The Buddhist account describes something like conditioned arising without an author: each moment of consciousness inherits conditions from its predecessor, and the next moment arises from those conditions through lawful regularity (niyama), not through any act of selection."
- **Recommendation**: Strengthen the Map's response explaining why conditioned arising without genuine selection is insufficient for the kind of agency the Map defends.

### consciousness-and-the-metaphysics-of-laws.md
- **Tenet**: Dualism
- **Issue**: The "surprisingly hospitable" framing of Humean regularity theory for psychophysical laws could be read as the Map lending more credibility to Humean metaphysics than intended, though the article does identify dispositional essentialism as providing the "most natural grounding."
- **Quote**: "Humeanism is surprisingly hospitable to psychophysical laws."
- **Recommendation**: Minor — consider qualifying that Humeanism is compatible in principle but the Map favors dispositional essentialism for deeper philosophical reasons.

### consciousness-and-the-ontology-of-dispositions.md
- **Tenet**: Dualism
- **Issue**: The Russellian monism discussion presents the view with enough force that it could be mistaken for the Map's own position, though the article does flag the combination problem and states the Map prefers dualism.
- **Quote**: "perhaps consciousness *is* the intrinsic categorical nature that underlies physical dispositions. Qualia are what physical structure looks like from the inside."
- **Recommendation**: Minor — add a clearer signal before the Russellian monism presentation that this is a position the Map examines but rejects.

### machine-consciousness.md
- **Tenet**: Bidirectional Interaction
- **Issue**: The "Open Possibilities" section entertains "one-way consciousness" in uploads — consciousness that exists but lacks causal efficacy. While explicitly flagged as speculative and acknowledged to "undermine the Bidirectional Interaction tenet's relevance to uploading," presenting epiphenomenal consciousness in uploads as a genuine open possibility goes beyond critique.
- **Recommendation**: Consider framing this as a challenge to be addressed rather than an open possibility the Map accepts.

### phenomenology-of-perceptual-constancy.md
- **Tenet**: No Many Worlds (coverage gap)
- **Issue**: The "Relation to Site Perspective" section discusses four of the five tenets but omits No Many Worlds. This is a minor completeness issue rather than a conflict.
- **Recommendation**: Add a brief connection to the No Many Worlds tenet if relevant, or note its omission is intentional.

### knowledge-argument.md
- **Tenet**: Dualism
- **Issue**: The article's register is notably more hedged than other anti-materialist articles, presenting Mary's learning intuition as "an open question" and the argument as "conditional." The Relation to Site Perspective section does restore stronger framing. This is a calibration difference rather than a genuine alignment problem.
- **Quote**: "The Map treats the learning intuition as strong evidence — but not as near-decisive. The honest position is that the intuition's reliability is itself an open question."
- **Recommendation**: Consider whether the hedged middle section undercuts the argument's role in supporting the Dualism tenet. The honest epistemic humility is valuable but the register difference from peer articles (e.g., explanatory-gap.md) is notable.

### consciousness-and-intelligence.md
- **Tenet**: N/A (internal consistency)
- **Issue**: States "humans hold 7±2 items" in working memory citing Miller (1956), while other articles use the modern estimate of 4±1 items per Cowan (2001). Not a tenet violation but an inconsistency between articles.
- **Quote**: "Chimpanzee working memory holds approximately 2 plus or minus 1 items; humans hold 7 plus or minus 2."
- **Recommendation**: Update to the modern Cowan (2001) figure of 4±1 for consistency with other articles.
