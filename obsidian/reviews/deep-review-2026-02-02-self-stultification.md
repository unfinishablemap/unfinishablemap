**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Article**: [[self-stultification|The Self-Stultification Argument]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article is well-structured with no factual errors, attribution problems, or internal contradictions.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Reliabilist response was thin**: Expanded with one sentence explaining why reliability presupposes normativity, added cross-link to argument-from-reason
- **Missing functionalist response**: Added new subsection addressing functionalist dissolution
- **Popper dating imprecise**: Changed "1950s" to cite 1977 Popper & Eccles book specifically

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Functionalist dissolution**: Now addressed in new subsection. Notes this requires denying phenomenal character is anything beyond functional organization—challenged by knowledge argument and conceivability arguments.
- **Eliminativist challenge**: Noted in review but not added—appropriate to scope (article targets epiphenomenalism, not eliminativism)
- **Buddhist processual self objection**: Sophisticated but beyond scope; noted as potential future expansion

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear opening paragraph with core claim front-loaded
- Excellent distinction between logical contradiction and self-stultification
- Well-organized six-step argument structure
- "Fortunate coincidence" rhetorical framing
- Appropriate historical context depth
- Substantive Relation to Site Perspective section connecting two tenets

### Enhancements Made
- Expanded reliabilist response with normative explanation
- Added functionalist dissolution subsection
- Improved Popper historical reference precision
- Added free-will cross-link in Further Reading

### Cross-links Added
- [[argument-from-reason]] in reliabilist section
- [[knowledge-argument]] in functionalist section
- [[philosophical-zombies]] in functionalist section
- [[topics/free-will]] in Further Reading

## Remaining Items

None. All identified improvements have been addressed.

## Stability Notes

This is the first review. The article was already well-structured and philosophically sound. The improvements were minor refinements rather than substantive corrections:

- The reliabilist and functionalist responses represent expected philosophical objections—their inclusion strengthens rather than changes the argument
- The Popper citation correction was a minor precision improvement
- The free-will cross-link makes an implicit connection explicit

Future reviews should NOT re-flag:
- "Eliminativists disagree with the premise" — This is a bedrock philosophical disagreement, not a flaw
- "Buddhist view challenges unified self" — Beyond article scope; could be expansion but not a gap
- "MWI proponents find indexical concerns unconvincing" — Noted in tenet section; philosophical standoff
