# Deep Review: Intuitive Dualism

**Date**: 2026-01-20
**File**: obsidian/concepts/intuitive-dualism.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
1. **No engagement with illusionism**: The article discussed the "folk error" dismissal but didn't address the illusionist response—the most radical physicalist position that would make the entire debate moot. **Resolution**: Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section with regress response and contemplative challenge.

2. **Incomplete "Relation to Site Perspective"**: Only mentioned Occam's Razor tenet; other tenets were ignored. **Resolution**: Expanded to cover all five tenets with substantive connections.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Missing standard sections**: No "What Would Challenge This View?" section (now standard for deep-reviewed articles). **Resolution**: Added section with five falsifiability conditions.

2. **No Process Philosophy perspective**: Other deep-reviewed articles include Whitehead's framework. **Resolution**: Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section connecting actual occasions to the debate.

3. **No Contemplative perspectives**: The debate focuses on untrained intuitions; trained observation evidence was missing. **Resolution**: Added "Contemplative Perspectives" section with Buddhist analysis and witness consciousness.

4. **Missing cross-links**: Key site content (illusionism, introspection, witness-consciousness, haecceity) not linked. **Resolution**: Added 7 new cross-links to frontmatter and Further Reading.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Illusionist interpretation of cognitive evidence**: Addressed in new section showing how illusionists could read either Bloom or Barrett as supporting their view, then provided regress response.
- **Training argument**: If dualism were illusion, contemplative training should dissolve it; instead it refines phenomenal access.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- The "genetic fallacy" argument is well-stated and philosophically sound
- The symmetric problem section effectively shows neither intuitive position has privileged standing
- The summary table provides useful overview of researchers and positions
- Good balance presenting both sides of the cognitive science debate
- Strong use of primary sources (Barrett et al., Bloom, Bering, Berent et al.)
- The opening summary effectively captures the key tension

### Enhancements Made
1. **The Illusionist Challenge** section: Three subsections covering illusionist reading of evidence, regress response, and contemplative challenge
2. **Process Philosophy Perspective** section: Whitehead's actual occasions, mind-body unity, explanation for why debate persists
3. **Contemplative Perspectives** section: Buddhist analysis (dharmas, conventional/ultimate truth), witness consciousness reports
4. **What Would Challenge This View?** section: Five falsifiability conditions
5. **Expanded Relation to Site Perspective**: From 3 paragraphs (one tenet) to substantive coverage of all 5 tenets
