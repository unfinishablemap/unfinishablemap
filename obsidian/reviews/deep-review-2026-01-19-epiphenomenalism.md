# Deep Review: Epiphenomenalism

**Date**: 2026-01-19
**File**: obsidian/concepts/epiphenomenalism.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article is logically sound and well-structured.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing cross-links to newer content**: Article lacked connections to evolution-of-consciousness.md, agent-causation.md, luck-objection.md, and minimal-consciousness.md - all highly relevant to the epiphenomenalism debate. *Resolution*: Added cross-links in frontmatter, body text, and Further Reading.

- **Evolutionary objection could be stronger**: The standard "tracking coincidence" argument was present but lacked concrete phylogenetic evidence. *Resolution*: Added paragraph linking to evolution-of-consciousness.md and minimal-consciousness.md to show that consciousness distribution across species compounds the coincidence problem.

- **No connection to agent causation framework**: the site's positive alternative to epiphenomenal consciousness (agent causation) wasn't mentioned. *Resolution*: Added paragraph in Relation to Site Perspective connecting to agent-causation.md and luck-objection.md.

### Low Issues Found
- Jackson's recantation not mentioned. *Resolution*: Added note in References that Jackson later abandoned epiphenomenalism (2003).

### Counterarguments Considered
The article already handles the main counterarguments well:
- Closure argument response via Minimal Quantum Interaction
- Byproduct response to evolutionary objection
- Self-stultification as decisive objection

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent opening metaphor ("steam rising from locomotive")
- Clear self-stultification argument
- Logical flow from view → motivation → objections → site response
- Fair treatment of opposing views before critique
- Strong tenet connections already present

### Enhancements Made
- Strengthened evolutionary objection with phylogenetic evidence
- Connected to agent causation as positive alternative framework
- Added note on Jackson's recantation for philosophical completeness
- Expanded Further Reading with relevant newer articles

### Cross-links Added
- [[evolution-of-consciousness]] (frontmatter + body + Further Reading)
- [[agent-causation]] (frontmatter + body + Further Reading)
- [[luck-objection]] (body + Further Reading)
- [[minimal-consciousness]] (frontmatter + body + Further Reading)

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues addressed in this review.
