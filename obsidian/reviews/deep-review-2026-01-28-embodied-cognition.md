# Deep Review: Embodied Cognition and the Extended Mind

**Date**: 2026-01-28
**File**: obsidian/concepts/embodied-cognition.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-22
**Cross-review context**: embodiment-cognitive-limits.md (new voids article)

## Length Status

3569 words (143% of 2500 soft threshold) — operating in length-neutral mode.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The previous review (2026-01-22) addressed major gaps. The article has stabilised.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Missing cross-link to embodiment-cognitive-limits.md**: The new voids article (created 2026-01-28) explores how embodiment shapes and constrains cognition—directly relevant to this concepts article.
   - **Resolution**: Added cross-link in Further Reading section and related_articles frontmatter.

### Low Issues Found
None requiring action given length constraints.

### Counterarguments Considered
All six adversarial personas were applied. Key objections (eliminativist rejection of phenomenological categories, MWI self-locating uncertainty, quantum timescale challenges) were already addressed in previous reviews. No new substantive objections identified.

### Cross-Review Analysis

The new voids article `embodiment-cognitive-limits.md` raises complementary themes:

| Theme | Voids Article | Concepts Article | Alignment |
|-------|---------------|------------------|-----------|
| Symbol grounding | Central focus | Discussed (lines 133-141) | Good |
| Interoception | Emphasised as constituting first-person perspective | Not mentioned | Gap (but linking suffices given length) |
| Conceptual metaphor | Extensive (Lakoff/Johnson) | Brief mention | Acceptable |
| Filter theory | Not discussed | Strong section | Complementary |

The articles are complementary: the concepts article focuses on how embodied cognition relates to dualism and the Map's tenets, while the voids article explores embodiment as a cognitive constraint. The cross-link enables readers to explore both angles.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Compelling choking argument for bidirectional interaction (unique to this article)
- Clear Dreyfus progression table with consciousness modes
- Strong filter theory compatibility section bridging embodied cognition with the Map's framework
- Excellent falsifiability section with five testable conditions
- Buddhist phenomenology section providing contemplative tradition parallels
- Process philosophy integration connecting Whitehead to Merleau-Ponty
- Appropriate hedging on quantum mechanisms while maintaining theoretical connection

### Enhancements Made
1. Added cross-link to [[embodiment-cognitive-limits]] in Further Reading (with description)
2. Added [[embodiment-cognitive-limits]] to related_articles frontmatter

### Cross-links Added
- [[embodiment-cognitive-limits]] — How embodiment shapes and constrains what we can think (voids)

## Remaining Items

None. The article has reached stability after three reviews (2026-01-20, 2026-01-22, 2026-01-28). All critical and medium issues have been addressed. The article is above soft threshold but the content is necessary and well-organised.

## Stability Notes

This article has stabilised. Key philosophical disagreements represent bedrock positions rather than fixable flaws:

- **Eliminativist objection**: Dennett-style objections to phenomenological categories are addressed (lines 92-99). The response notes that predictive success of phenomenological vocabulary suggests these categories track something real. This is a philosophical standoff, not a gap.

- **MWI objection**: Self-locating uncertainty is engaged (lines 205-208). The response argues that training effects require selection-like dynamics. This remains a fundamental disagreement about interpretation of quantum mechanics.

- **Quantum timescale objection**: The article acknowledges this as a genuine challenge while noting the phenomenological mapping holds regardless of mechanism (lines 199-204). This is appropriate epistemic humility, not a flaw.

Future reviews should NOT re-flag these as critical issues. The article presents the Map's perspective while acknowledging genuine philosophical disagreement.
