**Date**: 2026-01-30
**Article**: [[idealism|Idealism]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-20-idealism|2026-01-20]]

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Quantum mechanism stated without qualification**: Lines 93-94 stated that consciousness can influence quantum indeterminacy confidently without acknowledging decoherence challenges. **Resolution**: Added parenthetical qualifier noting the mechanism is speculative and faces decoherence challenges addressed elsewhere.

### Low Issues Found

1. **Eastern idealist traditions unacknowledged**: The article defined idealism broadly but discussed only Western analytic versions. **Resolution**: Added brief acknowledgment of Advaita Vedanta and Yogācāra Buddhism in the opening paragraph.

### Counterarguments Considered

**Eliminative Materialist (Churchland)**: The hard problem is assumed real without engaging eliminativist responses. *Assessment*: The Map's tenets commit to dualism. Previous review already noted this is appropriate scope limitation.

**Quantum Skeptic (Tegmark)**: Decoherence challenges to quantum consciousness were understated. *Assessment*: Addressed by adding qualifier pointing to tenets page.

**Many-Worlds Defender (Deutsch)**: The indexical identity argument doesn't engage MWI responses. *Assessment*: The No Many Worlds tenet is a bedrock commitment; this is philosophical disagreement, not a fixable flaw.

**Buddhist Philosopher (Nagarjuna)**: Eastern perspectives were absent. *Assessment*: Addressed with brief acknowledgment. Extensive treatment belongs in dedicated articles.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Fair treatment of idealism's genuine advantages (parsimony, dissolving hard problem)
- Honest acknowledgment of slime mold challenge
- Strong indexical identity argument connected to agent causation
- Epistemologically humble conclusion ("The choice depends on how one weighs the various puzzles")
- Extensive cross-linking to related concepts
- Clear opening that front-loads the key difference from the Map's position

### Enhancements Made

1. Added Eastern idealist traditions (Advaita Vedanta, Yogācāra Buddhism) to opening paragraph
2. Added qualifier to quantum mechanism claim with pointer to tenets page
3. Strengthened dualist response to slime mold challenge — reframed from "concedes something" to noting the challenge faces any view accepting degrees of consciousness

### Cross-links Added

- [[tenets]] — added in context of quantum mechanism qualification

## Remaining Items

None. The article has reached a stable state with this second review.

## Stability Notes

This is the second deep review of this article. The first review (2026-01-20) addressed structural issues: missing "Relation to Site Perspective" section, cross-linking gaps, and front-loading. This review made targeted refinements:

- Qualification of speculative mechanisms
- Acknowledgment of broader idealist traditions
- Strengthening the dualist response to a challenging counterexample

The article is now stable. Key philosophical disagreements noted:
- **Eliminativists** will reject the hard problem premise — this is the Map's starting point, not arguable within this article
- **MWI defenders** will find the indexical argument unsatisfying — this reflects the No Many Worlds tenet
- **Quantum skeptics** have legitimate decoherence concerns — now acknowledged with pointer to fuller treatment

Future reviews should not re-flag these as critical issues.

**Word count**: 2169 → 2214 (+45 words, 89% of soft threshold)
