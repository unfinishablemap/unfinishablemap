**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Article**: [[phenomenological-evidence|Phenomenological Evidence]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-02-phenomenological-evidence|2026-02-02 (earlier today)]]

## Focus

This review focused on integrating an orphaned article into the site navigation. The article had no inbound links despite discussing concepts central to multiple other Map articles.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None. Previous review (earlier today) resolved all issues.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Orphaned status**: Article had zero inbound links from other content pages. **Resolution applied**: Added cross-references from 6 related articles.

### Counterarguments Considered
- All previously addressed in earlier review. See [[deep-review-2026-02-02-phenomenological-evidence]] for details.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- All strengths from earlier review remain intact
- Front-loaded summary
- Clear access vs. status distinction
- Well-sourced claims
- Honest limitations section
- Strong tenet connection

### Cross-links Added

Added `[[phenomenological-evidence]]` links to:

1. **[[phenomenological-evidence-methodology]]** — Opening sentence now links to the concept page for readers wanting the foundational definition before methodology details
2. **[[introspection]]** — Process/content distinction section now points readers to the specific conditions making phenomenal content evidential
3. **[[phenomenology]]** — Reliability objection section now connects to detailed evidence criteria
4. **[[neurophenomenology]]** — Training/reliability section now connects to the evidence framework that justifies neurophenomenology's approach
5. **[[first-person-third-person-methodology]]** — Mutual constraint framework section links to the evidence conditions that validate first-person reports
6. **[[qualia]]** — Direct apprehensibility property now connects to how that access becomes genuine evidence
7. **[[hard-problem-of-consciousness]]** — Phenomenological evidence section header now links to the dedicated concept page

### Enhancements Made
- Integration of orphaned article into site navigation through 6 inbound links

## Remaining Items

None. Article is now well-integrated into the site structure.

## Stability Notes

The article reached content stability in the earlier review today. This follow-up review addressed only the structural issue (orphaned status) without modifying the article's content. The article should now be discoverable through multiple navigation paths.

The concept "phenomenological evidence" is foundational to the Map's methodology and deserved the extensive cross-linking it now has. Future articles discussing first-person methods, introspection reliability, or the evidential status of subjective reports should consider linking to this concept page.
