# Deep Review: Illusionism

**Date**: 2026-01-31
**File**: obsidian/concepts/illusionism.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-20

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Incorrect study attribution (line 71)**: Article claimed "A 2025 MIT study" but the actual research is from 2021 at Princeton (Graziano's lab). → Fixed: changed to "A 2021 study from Graziano's Princeton lab"

### Medium Issues Found
- None new. Previous review addressed all structural gaps (Process Philosophy, Mysterian Alternative, Knowledge Argument, falsifiability conditions).

### Low Issues Found
- "Contemplative traditions" reference (lines 136-137) remains vague but is appropriate for context.
- Framing of illusionism as "most radical" privileges dualist assumptions—acceptable given the Map's perspective.

### Counterarguments Considered
- Dennett's argument that explaining "seeming" IS explaining consciousness is represented but could be clearer in future iterations.
- All six adversarial personas engaged. No new critical gaps identified.

### Attribution Accuracy Check
- Galen Strawson "silliest claim ever made" quote: **Verified** (2018 NYRB "The Consciousness Deniers")
- PhilPapers 2020 survey 62% figure: **Verified** (62.42% said hard problem is genuine)
- Princeton 2021 TPJ study: **Corrected** (was incorrectly attributed to "MIT 2025")
- Frankish, Dennett, Graziano, Chalmers, McGinn, Whitehead attributions: All accurate

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening summary: Clear, direct, front-loads the key claim
- Big/Small illusionism distinction (Graziano): Well-explained
- Self-evidence objection (Strawson): Powerful and concise
- Moorean argument and meta-problem dilemma: Sophisticated presentation
- Infinite regress problem: Core challenge well-articulated
- Process Philosophy Challenge section (added 2026-01-20): Excellent
- Mysterian Alternative section (added 2026-01-20): Balanced perspective
- Knowledge Argument connection (added 2026-01-20): Good integration
- "What Would Challenge This View?" section: Four falsifiability conditions
- Relation to Site Perspective: Well-connected to Dualism, Bidirectional Interaction, and Occam's Limits tenets

### Enhancements Made
- Fixed incorrect "2025 MIT study" → "2021 study from Graziano's Princeton lab"
- Ensured `[[mental-effort]]` cross-link is properly formatted in Relation to Site Perspective
- Capitalized "The Map's" for consistency in Bidirectional Interaction paragraph

### Cross-links Verified
All cross-links from previous review remain valid:
- `[[introspection]]`
- `[[mysterianism]]`
- `[[knowledge-argument]]`
- `[[arguments-against-materialism]]`
- `[[mental-effort]]`

## Remaining Items

None. The article is well-structured and comprehensive after the 2026-01-20 review. This review focused on verification and minor corrections.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed twice. Key observations for future reviews:

1. **Adversarial personas will always disagree**: Dennett, Churchland, and other materialists would reject the article's framing. This is expected and not a flaw to fix—the Map takes a dualist perspective.

2. **Regress objection is bedrock**: Illusionists argue that "seeming" can be purely functional. Dualists argue this presupposes phenomenality. This is a fundamental philosophical disagreement, not something that better prose will resolve.

3. **Falsifiability conditions are established**: The four conditions in "What Would Challenge This View?" represent the article's empirical grounding. Unless new developments occur, this section is stable.

4. **Attribution verified**: All major quotes and claims have been checked. The 2021 Princeton study reference is now accurate.
