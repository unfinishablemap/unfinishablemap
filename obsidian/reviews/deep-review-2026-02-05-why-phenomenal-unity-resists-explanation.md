**Date**: 2026-02-05
**Article**: [[why-phenomenal-unity-resists-explanation|Why Phenomenal Unity Resists Physical Explanation]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-01-why-phenomenal-unity-resists-explanation|2026-02-01]]

## Context

This review was triggered because the article had no inbound links and was orphaned from the site navigation. The primary focus was integrating the article into the knowledge network through cross-references.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None—the article remains well-constructed. The previous review (2026-02-01) addressed all critical and medium issues identified at that time:
- Decoherence gap: Resolved with acknowledgment of Tegmark (2000) objection
- Relabeling consistency: Resolved with distinction between IIT's definitional move and quantum holism's structural claim
- Thalamic pacemaker dismissal: Resolved with specific explanation

No new issues were identified in this review.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Orphan status**: The article had no inbound links despite being referenced by several concept pages that should naturally link to it.
   - *Resolution*: Added cross-references from 4 related articles (see below)

### Counterarguments Considered
All major counterarguments were already addressed in the previous review:
- Eliminativist doubt: Addressed via illusionism section's precondition problem
- Decoherence objection: Explicitly acknowledged with Tegmark citation
- Multiple Drafts narrative: Structural argument applies

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear front-loaded opening summary (truncation resilient)
- Sharp BP1/BP2 distinction immediately establishing scope
- Effective orchestra analogy for illustrating coordination vs. unity
- Leibniz's mill argument deployed as category mismatch, not invisibility claim
- Honest assessment of strong emergence as admission of explanatory failure
- Three rigorous considerations against illusionism
- Comprehensive "Relation to Site Perspective" connecting all five tenets

### Enhancements Made
Primary focus was orphan integration:

1. Added cross-reference from `phenomenal-unity.md` (in "Why Unity Is Puzzling" section)
2. Added cross-reference from `binding-problem.md` (in "Why BP2 Remains Unsolved" section)
3. Added cross-reference from `neural-binding-mechanisms.md` (in "Why Classical Mechanisms Fail at BP2" section)
4. Added cross-reference from `unity-of-consciousness.md` (in "Why Unity Is Puzzling" section)

### Cross-links Added
The article now has inbound links from:
- [[phenomenal-unity]]
- [[binding-problem]]
- [[neural-binding-mechanisms]]
- [[unity-of-consciousness]]

## Remaining Items

None—the article is now integrated into the site navigation with appropriate inbound links from related concept pages.

## Stability Notes

The article reached stability after the first review (2026-02-01). This second review found no content changes needed—only integration work (adding cross-references from related articles).

The following represent bedrock philosophical disagreements rather than fixable problems:

- **Eliminativist critique**: Eliminativists will always find appeals to phenomenal unity question-begging. The article takes phenomenal unity as explanandum; eliminativists reject that framing. This is a foundational disagreement, not a flaw.

- **Quantum skepticism**: Those who reject quantum consciousness on empirical grounds (decoherence) will find the quantum alternative unpersuasive. The article honestly acknowledges this objection. Further empirical argument belongs in the linked [[quantum-consciousness]] article.

- **MWI defenders**: The indexical argument against MWI will not satisfy committed Many-Worlders who accept self-locating uncertainty. This is a tenet-level commitment of the Map, not an argument flaw.

The article should be considered stable. Future reviews should focus on verification that it remains current with any new research rather than seeking improvements to already-adequate sections.
