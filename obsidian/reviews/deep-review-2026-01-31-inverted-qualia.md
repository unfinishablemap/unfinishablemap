**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Article**: [[inverted-qualia|Inverted Qualia]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-20-inverted-qualia|2026-01-20]]

## Context

Changes since last review were minor: terminology updates ("this project" → "The Unfinishable Map/the Map") and addition of meta description. No substantive content modifications. Article is at 130% of soft word threshold (3259 words), so review operated in length-neutral mode.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The previous review (2026-01-20) addressed all major structural issues including adding the Illusionist Challenge section, Process Philosophy Perspective, and comprehensive tenet coverage.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **No Many Worlds argument was logically weak**: The original text conflated MWI's claim that all branches exist with the claim that facts about individual branches are meaningless. A MWI defender can coherently say "in this branch, Invert experiences phenomenal red."
   - *Resolution*: Rewrote to acknowledge branch-relative facts remain well-defined under MWI, while arguing the deeper indexical question ("which branch am *I* in?") points to something physics cannot capture.

2. **Contemplative evidence overgeneralized**: The claim that meditators find qualia becoming "more vivid" was too sweeping. Some Buddhist traditions (Madhyamaka) report the opposite—that close examination reveals the constructed nature of experience.
   - *Resolution*: Added acknowledgment of divergent meditative reports. Reframed the argument: if qualia were purely constructed, meditation should uniformly reveal this; the divergence suggests qualia may have both constructed and irreducible aspects.

3. **Challenge condition #5 too vague**: "Contemplative traditions converge on the illusionist view" lacked specificity about what traditions and what would count as convergence.
   - *Resolution*: Made explicit by naming specific practices (Theravada jhāna, Zen shikantaza, Tibetan dzogchen, Advaita self-inquiry) and stating what uniform reports would look like.

### Low Issues Noted (Not Addressed)

- The Dennett response could more accurately represent heterophenomenology (but current response is adequate)
- Quantum mechanism connection could be more clearly flagged as Map speculation (but is already somewhat flagged)

### Counterarguments Considered

1. **MWI defender response**: "Branch-relative facts are perfectly well-defined"
   - *How addressed*: Acknowledged this, but argued the deeper indexical question about first-person identity points beyond what the formalism captures.

2. **Buddhist anti-essentialism**: "Close examination reveals constructed nature of qualia"
   - *How addressed*: Incorporated this perspective rather than dismissing it, using the divergence in contemplative reports as evidence against pure illusionism.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Excellent core argument structure (lines 42-66)
- Clear comparative table relating to zombie arguments
- Strong Process Philosophy Perspective section
- Well-developed "What Would Challenge This View?" section
- Good integration of all five tenets in Relation to Site Perspective
- Comprehensive cross-links and references

### Enhancements Made

1. **Tightened No Many Worlds argument**: Now acknowledges MWI can handle branch-relative facts while identifying what it cannot capture (first-person indexicality)

2. **Balanced contemplative evidence**: Now represents the diversity of meditative reports rather than claiming uniform support

3. **Specified falsifiability conditions**: Challenge condition #5 now names specific traditions and what uniform illusionist-supporting reports would look like

### Cross-links Added

None needed—article already has excellent cross-linking from previous review.

## Remaining Items

None. All medium-priority issues were addressed. Low-priority issues are acceptable as-is.

## Stability Notes

This article is approaching stability. The core argument is sound, and the previous review (2026-01-20) addressed all structural gaps. This review made three targeted improvements to argument precision without expanding scope.

**Bedrock disagreements (do not re-flag):**
- Illusionists will continue to find the "regress response" question-begging—this is a philosophical standoff, not a fixable flaw
- MWI defenders will find the indexicality argument unsatisfying if they accept the theoretical sufficiency of branch-relative facts
- Dennett-style functionalists will reject the framing of "what it's like from the inside"—engaging with this requires presupposing what they deny

**Word count note:** Article remains at ~130% of soft threshold. Future reviews should maintain length-neutral approach and resist expansion.
