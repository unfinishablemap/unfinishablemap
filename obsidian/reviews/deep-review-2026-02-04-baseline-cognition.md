**Article**: [[baseline-cognition|Baseline Cognition]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-02-baseline-cognition|2026-02-02]]
**Context**: Task flagged orphan integration, but article has 28 inbound links from content files—well integrated.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Six adversarial personas reviewed the document:

### Eliminative Materialist (Churchland)
- The baseline/conscious distinction may track functional differences rather than phenomenal states
- *Assessment*: Medium issue; addressed in illusionism section; response adequate per previous reviews

### Hard-Nosed Physicalist (Dennett)
- Procedural/declarative distinction doesn't necessarily map to unconscious/conscious
- *Assessment*: Medium issue; addressed in illusionism section with argument from reason

### Quantum Skeptic (Tegmark)
- Quantum mechanisms appropriately hedged ("doesn't require quantum mechanisms")
- *Assessment*: Low; no issues

### Many-Worlds Defender (Deutsch)
- "Settling" argument articulated; this remains bedrock disagreement
- *Assessment*: N/A (philosophical standoff, not fixable flaw)

### Empiricist (Popper)
- All citations verified:
  - Völter et al. (2023) ✓
  - Lieberman et al. (2008) ✓
  - Randeniya (2025) ✓ (added in previous review)
  - De Neys (2012) ✓
  - Whiten (2015) ✓
  - Tomasello (2010) ✓
- *Assessment*: No issues

### Buddhist Philosopher (Nagarjuna)
- Article acknowledges degrees/kinds of consciousness
- Contemplative Perspectives section engages Buddhist concepts substantively
- *Assessment*: Low; appropriately nuanced

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article is citation-complete and internally consistent.

### Medium Issues Found
None new. Prior review issues remain addressed.

### Counterarguments Considered
All major counterarguments (illusionism, epiphenomenalism) have substantive responses. No new counterarguments identified.

### Attribution Accuracy Check
- Tomasello's "zone of latent solutions" — correctly attributed
- Whiten's "Jourdain Hypothesis" — correctly attributed
- Bischof-Köhler hypothesis — correctly named
- Global Workspace Theory — Dehaene & Changeux citation present

No attribution errors detected.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

Six sympathetic personas reviewed the document:

### Property Dualist (Chalmers)
- Opening clearly distinguishes phenomenal from access consciousness
- Systematic correspondence argument well-articulated
- Strong falsifiability section

### Quantum Mind Theorist (Stapp)
- Appropriately cautious about quantum mechanisms
- Bidirectional interaction connection well-made

### Phenomenologist (Nagel)
- Procedural/declarative distinction is phenomenologically precise
- "Experience without experiencing that they experience" is a strong formulation

### Process Philosopher (Whitehead)
- Contemplative Perspectives section engages Whitehead's "high-grade occasions" substantively

### Libertarian Free Will Defender (Kane)
- Free will implications section makes connection to libertarian free will explicit

### Mysterian (McGinn)
- Epistemic limits acknowledged appropriately
- "What Would Challenge This View?" demonstrates intellectual honesty

### Strengths Preserved
- Core hypothesis articulation in opening
- Domain-by-domain evidence structure (tool use, social cognition, metacognition, etc.)
- Illusionism and epiphenomenalism challenge sections
- Complete five-tenet connections
- Tables for procedural/declarative distinction, theory of mind levels, empathy hierarchy
- Strong falsifiability section

### Enhancements Made
None. Article does not require changes.

### Cross-links Status
Article has 28 inbound links from content files:
- Topics: animal-consciousness, consciousness-and-intelligence, consciousness-and-semantic-understanding, consciousness-in-simple-organisms, conservation-laws-and-mind, creativity-and-novel-combination, free-will
- Concepts: autonoetic-consciousness, bidirectional-interaction, blindsight, consciousness-and-social-cognition, consciousness-as-amplifier, consciousness, conscious-vs-unconscious-processing, counterfactual-reasoning, jourdain-hypothesis, llm-consciousness, metacognition, metarepresentation, qualia, self-and-consciousness, symbol-grounding-problem, teaching-as-metarepresentation, theory-of-mind, working-memory
- Apex: machine-question, minds-without-words
- Arguments: materialism

The article is **not orphaned**. The task context was incorrect.

## Length Check

**Current**: 3342 words (134% of 2500 soft threshold)
**Status**: Soft warning (below hard threshold of 3500)
**Action**: No changes applied, so length unchanged.

## Remaining Items

None. The article has reached stability after five reviews.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed five times (2026-01-22, 2026-01-25, 2026-01-27, 2026-02-02, 2026-02-04). This review confirms:

1. **No critical issues** — All citations present, no attribution errors, no internal contradictions
2. **No new medium issues** — Previous responses to counterarguments remain adequate
3. **Well-integrated** — 28 inbound links from content files (not orphaned as task context claimed)
4. **Length acceptable** — Above soft threshold but below hard; no changes needed

Key philosophical disagreements noted in previous reviews remain bedrock standoffs:

- **MWI proponents** will continue to find the "settling" argument unsatisfying—this is a bedrock disagreement about what selection means, not a fixable flaw
- **Eliminative materialists** will object that "consciousness" may not carve nature at joints—the article's illusionism response addresses this but cannot resolve fundamental ontological disagreements
- **Hard physicalists** can always retreat to "it's functional all the way down"—the argument from reason provides the Map's response but won't convince committed functionalists

These are expected philosophical standoffs given the Map's tenet commitments. Future reviews should not re-flag them as critical issues.

**Recommendation**: This article should be considered mature and excluded from deep-review queue unless substantially modified. Five reviews with no new issues indicates convergence.
