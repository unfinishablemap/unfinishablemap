## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Macnamara et al. 2014 figure inaccurate**: Article claimed deliberate practice explained "only about 12% of performance variance across domains." The actual meta-analysis found highly variable results: 26% in games, 21% in music, 18% in sports, 4% in education, under 1% in professions. **Resolution**: Replaced with domain-specific figures showing the variability.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing cross-links**: `phenomenology-of-cognitive-automatisation` and `motor-selection` are directly relevant but were not linked. **Resolution**: Added to Further Reading section.
- **Neural mechanism counterargument engagement**: The physicalist response in "What Would Challenge This View?" is honest but could engage slightly more with specific neural mechanisms (prefrontal-to-basal-ganglia transfer, error-prediction signals). **Deferred**: Article is already above soft threshold; expanding here would require equivalent cuts. Current treatment is adequate.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist**: Folk-psychological framing of "scaffolding" and "delegation" assumes the conclusion. Article engages this via the "What Would Challenge This View?" section.
- **Physicalist (Dennett-style)**: The choking argument has a neural account (attention networks interfering with basal ganglia). Article's response ("conscious attention should be neutral") is brisk but serviceable.
- **Empiricist**: Deliberate practice figure was the one factual vulnerability. Now corrected.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- The three-phase arc (construction, delegation, return) as central organizing structure — genuinely original
- The "architect" metaphor and its extensions throughout
- All phenomenological descriptions: novice vs expert swimmer, transition valley, doubled awareness, felt sacrifice of surrendering mastery
- The habit vs skill distinction (authored vs discovered action) — philosophically fertile
- "What Would Challenge This View?" section — admirably honest epistemic calibration
- Clean Map/source separation throughout — interpretations clearly labeled
- Body schema analysis grounded in Merleau-Ponty, Head & Holmes, Iriki et al.
- The coalesced structure (from three prior articles) reads as a unified piece, not a patchwork

### Enhancements Made
- Corrected Macnamara et al. 2014 to show domain-specific variance figures
- Added cross-links to `[[phenomenology-of-cognitive-automatisation]]` and `[[motor-selection]]`

### Cross-links Added
- [[phenomenology-of-cognitive-automatisation]]
- [[motor-selection]]

## Factual Verification

All major citations verified:
| Claim | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Dreyfus & Dreyfus, 1986 (five stages) | Correct |
| Fitts & Posner, 1967 (three phases) | Correct |
| Macnamara et al., 2014 (variance figures) | **Corrected** — was "12%", now domain-specific |
| Iriki et al., 1996 (tool use, receptive fields) | Correct |
| Milner, 1962 (amnestic motor retention) | Correct |
| Head & Holmes, 1911 (body schema) | Correct |
| Bernstein, 1967 (degrees of freedom) | Correct |
| Ericsson et al., 1993 (deliberate practice) | Correct |
| Merleau-Ponty "intentional arc" | Correct |

## Remaining Items

- Article at 122% of soft threshold (3647 words vs 3000 target). Not critical but future reviews should avoid expansion without equivalent cuts.
- The neural mechanism counterargument could be slightly more developed, but doing so would further inflate word count.

## Stability Notes

- The six adversarial personas found only one factual error and some medium-priority cross-link gaps. The article's philosophical arguments are sound and well-hedged.
- Physicalist objections (Churchland, Dennett personas) represent fundamental philosophical disagreements, not fixable flaws. The article engages these honestly in "What Would Challenge This View?" Future reviews should NOT re-flag "the neural account could explain this" as critical — it is a bedrock disagreement.
- The quantum interaction passages are appropriately marked as speculative. No need to flag these as problematic in future reviews.
- The Macnamara correction is now stable. Future reviews should verify the domain-specific figures if the article is modified, but should not revert to a single aggregate figure.
