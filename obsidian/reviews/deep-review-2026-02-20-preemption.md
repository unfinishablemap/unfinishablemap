**Date**: 2026-02-20
**Article**: [[preemption|Preemption]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Joint causation dismissal used contested premise**: The article dismissed joint causation because it "conflicts with the apparent completeness of physical causal chains," but this completeness is precisely what's at issue between dualists and physicalists. **Resolution**: Added acknowledgment that this is a contested premise.
- **Observational closure presented without falsifiability tension**: The article presented empirical indistinguishability as purely advantageous without noting it raises a methodological question. **Resolution**: Added sentence acknowledging that the case for preemption rests on philosophical arguments rather than direct empirical evidence.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist**: Preemption presupposes mental/physical ontological divide—bedrock disagreement with Map's dualist tenets, not addressable within article scope.
- **Physicalist circularity**: Joint causation dismissal relied on contested premise—addressed by adding acknowledgment.
- **Empiricist unfalsifiability**: Observational closure makes preemption empirically untestable—addressed by noting the philosophical grounding.
- **Buddhist dependent origination**: Questions whether causes can be neatly individuated—bedrock metaphysical disagreement.

## Attribution Accuracy Check

All checks passed:
- "Default causal profile" qualifier preserved correctly throughout
- Subset Law* and Delegatory Law accurately described
- Saad's framework correctly attributed; Map-specific claims clearly labeled in Relation to Site Perspective
- No misattributions, dropped qualifiers, overstated positions, or self-contradictions found

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Strong opening paragraph with front-loaded definition and Map's specific interest
- Clear assassin examples for early and late preemption (intuitive, well-structured)
- Major/sergeant analogy for trumping preemption
- Consistent and correct use of "default causal profile" qualifier
- Clean separation between Saad's claims and Map's interpretation
- Well-structured progression from general causation literature to philosophy of mind

### Enhancements Made
- **Agent causation connection developed**: Expanded thin paragraph to clarify the complementary roles of substance causation (ontological: who causes?) and preemption (structural: how does that cause interact with physical causes?)
- **Falsifiability tension acknowledged**: Added note that empirical indistinguishability means the case rests on philosophical arguments
- **Joint causation dismissal nuanced**: Acknowledged that causal completeness is a contested premise

### Cross-links Added
No new cross-links needed—existing links are comprehensive and accurate.

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues were addressed in this review.

## Stability Notes

- Eliminativist and Buddhist objections represent bedrock metaphysical disagreements with the Map's ontological framework—these are expected philosophical standoffs, not fixable article flaws.
- The falsifiability tension with observational closure is now acknowledged. Future reviews should not re-flag this as critical—it is an inherent feature of the preemption framework that the article now transparently addresses.
- The article is well below the soft word limit (1352/2500) and could accommodate expansion if future content development warrants it.
