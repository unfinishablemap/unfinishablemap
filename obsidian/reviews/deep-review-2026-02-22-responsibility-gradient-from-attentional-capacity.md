**Date**: 2026-02-22
**Article**: [[responsibility-gradient-from-attentional-capacity|The Responsibility Gradient: From Attentional Capacity to Moral Desert]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Broken internal link**: `[[Voluntary-attention|Voluntary attention]]` linked to a concept page that does not exist. Resolution: Changed to `[[attention-as-interface|Voluntary attention]]` and replaced `[[voluntary-attention]]` in frontmatter concepts with `[[phenomenology-of-agency-vs-passivity]]`.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Compatibilism strawman**: The "Against Binary Responsibility" section characterised compatibilism as uniformly "binary," ignoring Fischer and Ravizza's (1998) graded reasons-responsiveness theory—which was already in the bibliography. Resolution: Rewrote the section to acknowledge sophisticated compatibilism while distinguishing the Map's mechanistic explanation.
- **MWI argument thin**: The claim that desert "becomes incoherent" under many-worlds was asserted without explanation. Resolution: Expanded to explain why branching structure undermines desert.
- **Missing cross-links**: No connections to `phenomenology-of-agency-vs-passivity`, `authentic-vs-inauthentic-choice`, or `moral-perception` despite strong thematic relevance. Resolution: Added cross-link in Flexibility section and three entries to Further Reading.
- **Uncited references**: Meister (2024), Schwartz & Begley (2002), Strawson (1962), and Kane (1996) appear in bibliography without inline citation. Resolution: Deferred—these provide useful background context and Fischer & Ravizza is now cited inline. The others are standard references in the field.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist**: "Attention" is distributed across multiple neural systems, not a single coherent channel. Response: The Map's framework treats attention as the functional interface, not as a single anatomical structure. The five dimensions acknowledge this distributed nature.
- **Dennett-style physicalist**: Graded responsibility doesn't require dualism; cognitive psychology yields the same gradient. Response: Acknowledged by refining the compatibilism section. The Map's distinctive contribution is mechanistic unification through the attentional channel framework.
- **Quantum skeptic**: The ~10 bits/s claim and quantum selection framework are speculative. Response: Within-framework claim, properly grounded in the Map's tenets.
- **MWI defender**: Desert may remain coherent under branching. Response: Expanded the argument but noted this is a tenet-level commitment, not a provable claim.
- **Empiricist**: Framework adds no new predictions beyond cognitive psychology. Response: The unification under the attentional channel mechanism is the novel contribution; it predicts that ALL attentional impairments should mitigate proportionally.
- **Buddhist philosopher**: Cultivation principle assumes personal identity over time. Response: Acknowledged as a genuine philosophical challenge from non-Western perspectives; the Map's substance dualism includes a persistent self.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Five-dimension framework (bandwidth, stability, scope, flexibility, availability) — genuine conceptual contribution
- Cultivation principle with three illustrative cases (involuntary, negligent, cultivated) — excellent pedagogy
- Both tables (gradient and control-theoretic mapping) — clear and immediately useful
- Opening summary — front-loads the core claim perfectly, survives truncation
- All five tenet connections — comprehensive and well-argued
- Objections section — honest engagement with real concerns
- The gradient's floor — principled prevention of excuse-making

### Enhancements Made
- Connected flexibility dimension to moral perception, strengthening the argument that attentional inflexibility produces moral blindness
- Added three cross-links to Further Reading (phenomenology-of-agency-vs-passivity, authentic-vs-inauthentic-choice, moral-perception)
- Refined compatibilism engagement to acknowledge Fischer & Ravizza's sophistication while distinguishing the Map's mechanistic approach
- Expanded MWI argument with clearer explanation of why branching undermines desert

### Cross-links Added
- [[moral-perception]] (inline, in Flexibility section)
- [[phenomenology-of-agency-vs-passivity]] (Further Reading)
- [[authentic-vs-inauthentic-choice]] (Further Reading)
- [[moral-perception]] (Further Reading)

## Remaining Items

- Uncited bibliography entries (Meister, Schwartz & Begley, Strawson, Kane) — low priority, these provide useful background
- Buddhist/personal identity challenge to cultivation principle — acknowledged as philosophical disagreement, not a flaw requiring fix
- Novel explanatory claim vs. cognitive psychology could be made more explicit in future refinement

## Stability Notes

- The eliminative materialist and Dennett-style objections represent bedrock disagreements about whether consciousness is a coherent causal category. These are not fixable flaws—they are consequences of the Map's dualist commitments. Future reviews should not re-flag them as critical.
- The quantum skeptic's concern about the speculative nature of quantum selection is a tenet-level commitment. The article correctly presents it within the Map's framework rather than as established science.
- The Buddhist personal identity challenge is a genuine philosophical disagreement that the Map's substance dualism addresses differently. This is a worldview difference, not an error.
