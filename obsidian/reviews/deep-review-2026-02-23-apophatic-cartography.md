**Date**: 2026-02-23
**Article**: [[apophatic-cartography|Apophatic Cartography as Epistemic Method]]
**Previous review**: Never (first deep review; article had a prior pessimistic review on 2026-02-19 that informed refinements already present)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None. No factual errors, misattributions, or internal contradictions detected.

### Medium Issues Found
- **MWI tenet connection was strained**: The claim that MWI "dissolves the determinate viewpoint" oversimplified — each branch still has a determinate observer. Resolution: rewrote to clarify that the issue is indexical *uniqueness* and metaphysical significance, not mere existence of a perspective per branch.
- **Illusionism characterization slightly uncharitable**: Line 95 originally said illusionism "still must explain why there appears to be something it is like." This begs the question against illusionism's own explanatory resources. Resolution: reworded to acknowledge illusionism's introspection-mechanism account while preserving the framework-independence argument.
- **AI refinement log comment block remaining**: Lines 186-198 contained a comment block marked "should be removed after human review" from the 2026-02-19 refinement. Resolution: removed.
- **Orphaned article with zero inbound links**: Primary focus of this review. Resolution: added cross-references from 10 existing articles (see below).

### Counterarguments Considered
- Eliminative materialist: "Apophatic cartography dresses up a refusal to do neuroscience." Response: Criterion 4 (Framework Independence) and Integration with Cognitive Science section address this directly — the method complements, not replaces, empirical investigation.
- MWI defender: "Each branch has a determinate observer, so MWI doesn't dissolve perspective." Response: accepted and incorporated — tightened the tenet connection.
- Empiricist: "Falsifiability condition for hard problem may be practically unfalsifiable." Response: acknowledged as bedrock philosophical standoff — the condition is well-defined even if agreement on whether it's met may be contested.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- The four criteria (structured persistence, cross-observer convergence, signature specificity, framework independence) — the article's core and most original contribution
- The astrology counterexample motivating Criterion 4 — brilliant demonstration that three criteria alone are insufficient
- AI triangulation with three distinct outcomes (same failure, genuine solution, different failure)
- Three safeguards against unfalsifiable mystique
- The worked example applying all criteria to the hard problem
- Careful qualification of contemplative tradition convergence (methodological vs. target convergence)

### Enhancements Made
- Tightened MWI tenet connection for philosophical accuracy
- Improved illusionism characterization for fairness
- Removed stale AI refinement log

### Cross-links Added (Orphan Integration)

## Remaining Items

None. The article is well-structured and addresses its subject matter thoroughly. Word count (2546) is above the voids soft threshold (2000) but well below the hard threshold (3000); no condensation warranted given the density of original methodological content.

## Stability Notes

- The MWI tenet connection is a bedrock philosophical disagreement. MWI defenders will always argue that branching preserves determinate perspectives. The article now acknowledges this while maintaining the indexical-uniqueness argument. Future reviews should NOT re-flag this as critical.
- Buddhist philosophers may contest the characterization of sunyata as "targeting inherent existence" vs. its broader methodological implications. The article already qualifies the convergence claim carefully. This is a nuanced interpretive matter, not a factual error.
- The article's length (127% of soft threshold) reflects the density of its four-criteria methodology. Condensation would sacrifice core content. Unless the article exceeds the hard threshold, future reviews should not flag length.
