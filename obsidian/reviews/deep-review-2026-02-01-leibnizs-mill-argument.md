**Date**: 2026-02-01
**Article**: [[leibnizs-mill-argument|Leibniz's Mill Argument]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article had no factual errors, misattributions, internal contradictions, or missing required sections.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Emergence response too vague**: The claim that Leibniz "anticipated" the emergence objection was underdeveloped. Resolution: Expanded the response to explain why wetness is disanalogous to consciousness (structural vs. phenomenal properties) and why emergence labels the problem rather than solving it.

- **Functionalism/computation analogy underengaged**: The article mentioned the "mistake objection" without addressing the strongest version—the computation analogy (where is "computation" among transistors?). Resolution: Added explicit engagement with this analogy, explaining why computation is fully captured by structural description while perception is not.

- **Intuition reliability caveat needed**: The article relied on intuition without acknowledging that intuitions have been unreliable guides to physics historically. Resolution: Added a paragraph distinguishing Leibniz's intuition from failed physical intuitions—his point is about the relationship between physical description and phenomenal quality, not about what physical mechanisms are possible.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialism**: The article mentions illusionism but could engage more with eliminativism. Deferred—illusionism paragraph is adequate for scope.
- **Heterophenomenology**: Dennett's approach is implicitly addressed via the computation analogy response.
- **Buddhist emptiness critique**: Fundamental disagreement about subject/object duality; not a flaw to fix.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Original Monadology quotation (§17) grounds article in primary source
- Clear four-step reconstruction of the argument structure
- Vivid phrasing: "Walk through the mill. Look around. Where is the experience?"
- Careful separation of Leibniz's own views (pre-established harmony) from Map's position (interactionist dualism)
- Effective connection to zombie argument and hard problem

### Enhancements Made
- Strengthened emergence response with specific analysis of wetness disanalogy
- Added computation analogy engagement in mistake objection section
- Added caveat about intuition reliability with explanation of why this case differs
- Added cross-link to [[consciousness]] concept in emergence section
- Added cross-links to [[functionalism]] and [[free-will]] in Further Reading

### Cross-links Added
- [[consciousness]]
- [[functionalism]] (Further Reading)
- [[free-will]] (Further Reading)

## Word Count

Before: 1496 words (50% of 3000 threshold)
After: 1709 words (57% of 3000 threshold)
Change: +213 words

## Remaining Items

None. All identified medium issues were addressed. Low issues (Minimal Quantum Interaction connection feeling slightly forced; "walking through" assumes impossible external perspective) are philosophical disagreements or minor concerns that don't warrant changes—the current treatment is acceptable.

## Stability Notes

The article now addresses the main materialist responses (emergence, functionalism, epistemic limitation) with sufficient depth. Future reviews should NOT re-flag these as needing expansion unless specific new problems are identified. The following represent philosophical standoffs, not fixable flaws:

- **Eliminativists will reject the "perception" category** — This is a bedrock disagreement about whether folk psychological terms carve nature at its joints.
- **Dennettians will insist heterophenomenology is sufficient** — The article addresses this via the computation analogy; further engagement would be circular.
- **Empiricists may distrust any intuition-based argument** — The caveat about intuition reliability addresses this concern adequately.
