**Date**: 2026-01-26
**Article**: [[knowledge-argument|The Knowledge Argument (Mary's Room)]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-20-knowledge-argument|2026-01-20]]

## Cross-Review Context

This review was triggered as a cross-review following the creation of consciousness-only-territories.md. That article uses acquaintance knowledge (from Mary's Room) as its central example of consciousness-exclusive content. The review focused on ensuring bidirectional linkage and conceptual coherence between the two articles.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing cross-link to consciousness-only-territories**: The knowledge argument is the primary example used in consciousness-only-territories for acquaintance knowledge, but no link existed. Now addressed.

### Counterarguments Considered
- All major counterarguments were addressed in the previous review (2026-01-20). No new gaps identified.

### Notes from Previous Review
The 2026-01-20 review addressed:
- Unverified survey statistic (removed)
- Missing falsifiability section (added)
- Missing illusionist engagement (added)
- Introspection question (added)
- Process philosophy perspective (added)

These issues remain resolved. This review did not re-flag them.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear five-step formalization of the argument
- Fair treatment of physicalist responses (Ability, Phenomenal Concepts, Dennett, Illusionist)
- Strong connection to convergence argument
- Effective treatment of Jackson's self-rejection
- Process philosophy perspective
- "What Would Challenge This View?" section
- Introspection defense with citations

### Enhancements Made
- Added "Acquaintance Knowledge" subsection in Connection to Related Arguments, linking to consciousness-only-territories
- Added consciousness-only-territories to frontmatter concepts
- Added consciousness-only-territories to Further Reading section (first position)

### Cross-links Added
- [[consciousness-only-territories]] — acquaintance knowledge as consciousness-exclusive territory

## Length Analysis

- **Before**: 2378 words (95% of 2500 soft threshold)
- **After**: ~2440 words (98% of soft threshold)
- **Change**: +62 words

The addition is modest and keeps the article within the soft threshold. The new content adds genuine conceptual value by connecting to the voids framework.

## Remaining Items

None. The article is stable and well-integrated with the consciousness-only-territories content.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed twice (2026-01-20, 2026-01-26). The first review made substantial additions (illusionist response, introspection section, process philosophy, falsifiability). This second review made only targeted cross-linking improvements.

The following represent stable positions that future reviews should NOT re-flag:
- The treatment of Dennett's response as "missing the point" is a philosophical judgment, not a flaw
- The convergence argument claim (seven arguments) is supported by the arguments-against-materialism article
- Physicalist critics will always find the "learning claim" intuition unconvincing—this is a bedrock philosophical disagreement

The article is approaching stability. Future reviews should focus only on:
- New cross-linking opportunities as related content is created
- Factual errors if discovered
- Style guide changes that affect this content
