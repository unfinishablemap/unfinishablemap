**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Article**: [[arguments|Arguments]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The index page is accurate, honest about its advocacy purpose, and correctly summarizes the linked articles.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing "Relation to Site Perspective" section**: Required by writing style guide. **Resolution**: Added section connecting all arguments to the five tenets and explaining how they form a cumulative case.

### Low Issues Found
- Could add more cross-links to related concepts: **Deferred**—index pages are deliberately minimal; the new section adds appropriate tenet links.

### Counterarguments Considered
All six adversarial personas (Eliminative Materialist, Hard-Nosed Physicalist, Quantum Skeptic, Many-Worlds Defender, Empiricist, Buddhist Philosopher) were applied. Key observations:
- The opening paragraph honestly identifies these as "explicit defenses," not neutral treatments—appropriate framing
- The quantum mechanics claim ("not causally closed in the way materialism requires") is philosophical argument pointing to detail pages, not a factual assertion
- MWI defenders will find the indexical argument unpersuasive, but this is philosophical disagreement, not a flaw to fix

### Attribution Accuracy Check
- Verified "seven arguments" claim against interactionist-dualism.md (line 89)—accurate
- All other claims correctly point to detail pages without overstating

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear opening paragraph stating section purpose
- "Key claims" + "Discussion" structure for each argument (excellent for LLM truncation resilience)
- Accurate, concise summaries that don't overstate
- Honest self-identification as defenses rather than neutral surveys

### Enhancements Made
- Added "Relation to Site Perspective" section with:
  - Explicit connections to all four relevant tenets (Dualism, Bidirectional Interaction, Minimal Quantum Interaction, No Many Worlds)
  - Explanation of how arguments form a cumulative case
  - Cross-links to [[tenets]] and individual tenet anchors

### Cross-links Added
- [[tenets|foundational commitments]]
- [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]
- [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]
- [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]
- [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]

## Remaining Items

None. The index page now meets all writing style guide requirements.

## Stability Notes

This is an index/landing page for the Arguments section. It correctly serves as a navigation point with previews, not a standalone argument. The "Relation to Site Perspective" section now provides the required tenet connection without expanding beyond the page's navigational purpose.

Future reviews should note:
- The adversarial personas (MWI defenders, materialists) will always disagree with the positions summarized—this is philosophical disagreement, not a flaw
- The index summaries accurately represent their linked articles; changes to detail pages may require corresponding updates here
