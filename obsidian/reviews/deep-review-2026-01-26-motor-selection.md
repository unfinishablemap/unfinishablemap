**Date**: 2026-01-26
**Article**: [[motor-selection|Motor Selection and the Attention-Motor Interface]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-21-motor-selection|2026-01-21]]
**Context**: Cross-review considering dopamine-selection-interface.md insights

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. Previous review's critical issues (missing illusionism section, missing process philosophy section) remain resolved.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Missing dopamine-selection-interface cross-link**
   - Finding: Basal ganglia section discussed brake-release mechanisms without referencing the new dopamine article that elaborates threshold modulation, wanting/liking, and tonic/phasic signaling
   - Resolution: Added new "Dopamine's Role in Selection" subsection with explicit cross-link and integration of Palmiter's mice evidence

2. **Dopamine's role underspecified**
   - Finding: Article said consciousness "biases" selection but didn't address what work remains given dopamine's threshold-setting role
   - Resolution: Added explicit clarification—dopamine marks salience and sets threshold; consciousness determines which marked option crosses first

3. **Prose trimming for length neutrality**
   - Finding: Article at 132% of soft threshold
   - Resolution: Condensed "Parallel to Thalamic Gating" section and "Free Won't" section to offset additions

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Dennett's objection** (what work is left for consciousness given dopamine?): Now explicitly addressed—dopamine marks and enables; consciousness selects among marked options
- **Tegmark's decoherence concern**: Not fully addressed in this review; remains a deeper issue for the quantum framework generally

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Double dissociation evidence (Desmurget parietal vs premotor findings)
- Phenomenology of motor choice section (from 2026-01-21 review)
- Illusionist challenge section (from 2026-01-21 review)
- Process philosophy section (from 2026-01-21 review)
- Attention-motor parallel table
- Veto model discussion
- All five tenets covered in Relation to Site Perspective

### Enhancements Made

1. Added "Dopamine's Role in Selection" subsection to basal ganglia section
2. Integrated Palmiter's dopamine-deficient mice as evidence for capacity/initiation distinction
3. Made explicit the three-layer model: computation → dopamine marking → conscious selection

### Cross-links Added

- [[dopamine-selection-interface]] (frontmatter concepts)
- [[dopamine-selection-interface]] (Further Reading)
- [[dopamine-selection-interface]] (inline in new subsection)

## Word Count Change

- Before: 3297 words
- After: 3326 words
- Net addition: +29 words (length-neutral within margin)

## Remaining Items

None requiring immediate follow-up.

## Stability Notes

The article has now been reviewed twice (2026-01-21 and 2026-01-26). The first review added substantial sections (illusionism, process philosophy, phenomenology). This review focused on cross-linking with new dopamine content—a targeted integration rather than structural change.

Bedrock philosophical disagreements identified:
- **MWI proponents** will find the "No Many Worlds" argument unsatisfying—this is expected philosophical standoff
- **Decoherence skeptics** will question quantum effects in warm neural tissue—the Map acknowledges speculative mechanism status
- **Eliminativists** will deny the explanatory need for non-physical selection—fundamental worldview difference

These represent stable disagreements, not fixable flaws. Future reviews should not re-flag them as critical issues.
