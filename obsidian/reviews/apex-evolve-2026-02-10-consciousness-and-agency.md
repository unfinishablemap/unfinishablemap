## Pessimistic Review

### Clarity Critic
- Opening paragraph overloaded with rhetorical questions — split for readability
- "Consciousness as Selector, Not Generator" section packed three implications into one paragraph
- "Heterophenomenology" introduced without definition
- Dense neuroscience jargon in neural signatures paragraph (Desmurget's brain regions)
- Time section under-scaffolded for its radical claims about atemporal selection
- Bischof-Köhler hypothesis introduced without bridging context

### Redundancy Hunter
- Quantum selection mechanism described four times (opening, selector section, mental causation, synthesis)
- Agent causation explained in both its own section and the mental causation section
- "The brain does the heavy lifting" appeared twice in nearly identical form
- Synthesis section restated evidence from luck objection rather than synthesizing
- Three features answering luck objection partially repeated in synthesis

### Narrative Flow Analyst
- Article followed source-article order rather than argumentative order
- Transition from Time to Moral Responsibility was weakest seam
- Capacity to Refrain and Counterfactual Reasoning misplaced under Luck Objection heading
- Synthesis section told rather than showed — listed source articles and their roles
- Relation to Site Perspective re-argued points from the body
- Closing paragraph buried after abstract chain-of-dependence discussion

## Optimistic Review

### Connection Finder — Key New Material Available
1. **Creative generation** (agent-causation, free-will): Agents generate options through imagination, not just select — contradicts pure "selector, not generator" framing
2. **Delegatory dualism** (mental-causation): Saad 2025 — second route past exclusion problem via preemption
3. **Existentialism/pour-soi** (free-will): Sartre's self-distance as phenomenological ground for agent causation
4. **Attentional economics** (agent-causation, moral-responsibility, phenomenology-of-choice): Agency as allocation of scarce attentional resource
5. **Phenomenology of intellectual effort** (free-will, argument-from-reason, phenomenology-of-choice): Extends effort evidence to reasoning
6. **Process philosophy/concrescence** (time-collapse-and-agency, agent-causation, phenomenology-of-choice): Whitehead's framework as complement
7. **Contemplative evidence** (time-collapse-and-agency, phenomenology-of-choice): Buddhist Abhidhamma, cessation states
8. **Consciousness-value connection** (moral-responsibility): Consciousness grounds both patienthood and agency
9. **Observational vs universal closure** (mental-causation): Saad's distinction paralleling Map's quantum framework

### Synthesis Strengthener
- Synthesis section needed generation-selection insight (current framing contradicted by sources)
- Exclusion problem section was mono-response (only quantum opening); needed delegatory dualism
- Argument from reason needed clearer structural role as failsafe against illusionism
- Moral responsibility missing consciousness-value connection
- Mutual support structure needed updating with new nodes (attentional economics, creative generation, process philosophy)

### Human Reader Advocate
- Only one vivid example (coin flip) in entire article
- Agent causation section read like reference rather than narrative
- Time section most abstract — needed concrete analogies
- Moral responsibility needed more vivid examples
- Closing should return to opening image

## Length Assessment

- **Before**: 3739 content words
- **After**: 2769 content words
- **Target range**: 2500-4000 words
- **Assessment**: Reduced by ~26% through cutting redundancy while integrating new material

## Summary of Changes Made

### Structural
- Renamed "Consciousness as Selector, Not Generator" to "The Selector Model" — reflecting nuanced generation-selection position
- Promoted "Capacity to Refrain" and "Counterfactual Reasoning" from H3 subsections under Luck Objection to independent H2 sections
- Split opening paragraph for readability
- Compressed Relation to Site Perspective into a single paragraph (was five separate paragraphs)
- Removed source-article enumeration from synthesis section ("Individual source articles establish components...")

### New Material Integrated
1. **Generation-selection synthesis**: Added caveat paragraph in Selector Model section acknowledging creative generation
2. **Delegatory dualism**: Added as second route past exclusion problem alongside quantum opening
3. **Sartre's pour-soi**: Added to agent causation section as phenomenological ground for self-distance
4. **Process philosophy**: Added Whitehead's substance causation and concrescence to agent causation and time sections
5. **Attentional economics**: Added to selector model and moral responsibility sections
6. **Argument from reason as failsafe**: Made structural role explicit — insurance against illusionism
7. **Consciousness-value connection**: Added to moral responsibility section
8. **Observational closure**: Added via Saad's distinction
9. **Buddhist Abhidhamma**: Added to capacity to refrain section (cetanā)
10. **Desmurget dissociation**: Simplified for accessibility (removed brain region jargon)
11. **Mathematical function analogy**: Added to time section for scaffolding atemporal selection

### Redundancy Removed
- Quantum selection mechanism: reduced from 4 occurrences to 2 (opening thesis + synthesis)
- Agent causation re-explanation in mental causation section: replaced with forward reference
- "Heavy lifting" duplicate phrasing eliminated
- Synthesis section rewritten to show mutual support rather than recapitulate evidence
- Relation to Site Perspective compressed from ~250 words to ~120 words

### Narrative Improvements
- Synthesis section now integrates new elements (generative engagement, attentional economics, process philosophy) into the mutual support structure
- Closing paragraph returns to opening image ("when you chose to speak rather than stay silent")
- Transition from time to responsibility improved via consciousness-value connection
- Neural signatures paragraph simplified for accessibility
