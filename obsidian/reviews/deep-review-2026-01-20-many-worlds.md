# Deep Review: The Many-Worlds Interpretation

**Date**: 2026-01-20
**File**: obsidian/concepts/many-worlds.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Unverifiable citation**: "A 2025 Nature Physics survey found substantial (though not majority) physicist support" - removed as unverifiable claim. Resolution: replaced with more general statement about substantial support.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing illusionist engagement**: Article didn't address how illusionists might respond to the indexical identity objection. Resolution: added full "The Illusionist Challenge" section with three-part response.
- **Missing process philosophy perspective**: Pattern established in other deep-reviewed articles. Resolution: added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section connecting Whitehead's actual occasions to MWI critique.
- **Missing falsifiability section**: Pattern established in other articles. Resolution: added "What Would Challenge This View?" section with five conditions.
- **Incomplete tenet coverage**: Only covered 3 of 5 tenets in Relation to Site Perspective. Resolution: expanded to cover all 5 tenets explicitly.

### Counterarguments Considered
- Illusionist dissolution of indexical problem (addressed with regress argument)
- Decision-theoretic derivations of Born rule (noted as contested)
- MWI's mathematical elegance (acknowledged as genuine virtue)

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear five-argument structure against MWI
- Fair treatment of MWI's genuine appeal
- Strong indexical identity argument (section 2)
- Good engagement with Deutsch/Carroll/Wallace responses
- Opening summary front-loads key claim (truncation-resilient)

### Enhancements Made
- Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section showing problem persists for illusionists
- Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" with Whitehead's actual occasions
- Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section with 5 falsifiability conditions
- Expanded "Relation to Site Perspective" to cover all 5 tenets
- Added decoherence wikilink in section 5

### Cross-links Added
- [[illusionism]]
- [[decoherence]]
- [[introspection]]
- [[mental-causation]]
- [[personal-identity]] (in Further Reading)

### References Added
- Whitehead, A.N. (1929). *Process and Reality*
- Frankish, K. (2016). Illusionism as a Theory of Consciousness
- Saunders, S. et al. eds. (2010). *Many Worlds?*
