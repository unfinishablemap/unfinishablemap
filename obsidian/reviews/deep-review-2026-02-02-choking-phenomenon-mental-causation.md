**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Article**: [[choking-phenomenon-mental-causation|Choking Under Pressure as Evidence for Mental Causation]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Six adversarial personas reviewed the article:

1. **Eliminative Materialist** — Argued the phenomenon is neural competition (prefrontal vs. cerebellar), no phenomenal consciousness needed. The article's core argument holds: even if the mechanism is neural, the question is why phenomenological distinctions track the interference pattern.

2. **Hard-Nosed Physicalist** — Critiqued the illusionism section as potentially conflating functional and phenomenal seeming. Valid concern addressed in revisions.

3. **Quantum Skeptic** — Noted the quantum connection is appropriately minimal. No changes needed.

4. **Many-Worlds Defender** — No specific critique; phenomenon is orthogonal to interpretation questions.

5. **Empiricist** — Flagged need for methodological note about replication concerns in psychology. Addressed in revisions.

6. **Buddhist Philosopher** — Critiqued imposition of dualist framework on non-dualist contemplative traditions. Addressed in revisions.

### Critical Issues Found
None. Article is factually sound, internally consistent, has required sections, follows style guide.

### Medium Issues Found
- Illusionism engagement needed tightening: [Resolved] Rewrote "The Illusionist Challenge" section with clearer arguments (causal tracking problem, heterophenomenological response)
- Contemplative section risked misrepresenting traditions: [Resolved] Added acknowledgment of Buddhist/Zen metaphysics differing from Map's dualism
- Missing methodological note: [Resolved] Added parenthetical about replication and note about core finding robustness

### Counterarguments Considered
- Illusionist/eliminativist response that interference is purely neural: Article now addresses this more directly through the "causal tracking problem" argument
- Heterophenomenology objection: Now explicitly engaged

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

Six sympathetic personas reviewed the article:

1. **Property Dualist** — Praised the "negative evidence" framing as sidesteping confabulation objections
2. **Quantum Mind Theorist** — Appreciated appropriate restraint on mechanism claims
3. **Phenomenologist** — Highlighted vivid phenomenological descriptions as strengths
4. **Process Philosopher** — Noted article treats consciousness as processual rather than static
5. **Libertarian Free Will Defender** — Praised agent causation section and phenomenology of effort
6. **Mysterian** — Approved epistemic humility in limitations section

### Strengths Preserved
- "Negative evidence" argument structure (why confabulation can't explain interference)
- Phenomenological descriptions of choking vs. absorbed performance
- Agent causation section's treatment of mental effort
- Epistemic humility in "What Choking Cannot Show"
- Clear, confident voice throughout

### Enhancements Made
- Strengthened illusionism response with three clearer arguments
- Added replication/robustness note to research findings
- Refined contemplative section to acknowledge differing metaphysical frameworks

### Cross-links Added
None needed; article already has extensive cross-linking.

## Remaining Items

None. All medium issues addressed.

## Stability Notes

The adversarial personas (especially eliminative materialist and hard-nosed physicalist) disagree with the article's conclusions by design. Their objections represent fundamental philosophical disagreements about whether phenomenal consciousness exists and is causally relevant—these are bedrock disagreements the Map takes a position on via its tenets, not flaws to fix. Future reviews should not re-flag "materialists would disagree" as a critical issue.
