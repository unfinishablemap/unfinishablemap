## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article is well-constructed and internally consistent.

### Medium Issues Found
- **"Dissolves" too strong (line 71)**: The grain problem is reframed by hierarchical selection, not eliminated. Changed to "addresses the grain problem directly."
- **Identity response dismissed too quickly**: Added acknowledgment that the identity approach works for physicalists before noting it's unavailable to dualists.
- **Stapp quantum Zeno insufficiently hedged**: Rewrote to present as "one proposed mechanism" with explicit uncertainty markers and note that the Map treats it as one possibility, not a commitment.
- **Opening paragraph too long**: Split into two paragraphs for style guide compliance (1-3 sentence paragraphs).
- **Epiphenomenalism threat unaddressed**: Added paragraph explicitly addressing why hierarchical selection doesn't collapse into epiphenomenalism—genuine quantum openness means policy-level selection is real causal work.

### Low Issues Found
- **10⁹ bits/second uncited**: Added Norretranders (1998) citation.
- **"Phenomenology of deliberate choice" uncited**: Left as-is since it links to the consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns article which provides the empirical grounding.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist**: Hierarchical selection can be described in purely neural terms. Response: The article's architecture doesn't depend on which ontology is correct—the bandwidth constraint is an empirical fact. The dualist interpretation is that consciousness provides genuine selection among quantum-open alternatives.
- **Epiphenomenalism from hierarchical selection**: If brain does all specification, what's left for consciousness? Response: Added explicit paragraph addressing this—genuine quantum openness means selection is real causal work.
- **MWI objection**: Selection is illusory in Many-Worlds. Response: Bedrock tenet disagreement, not a fixable issue.
- **Testability concern**: How to distinguish conscious selection from deterministic brain selection? Response: This is a broader challenge to all interactionist frameworks; noted as an honest open question in the format translation section.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Three-dimension framework (capacity, grain, format) — excellent organizing device
- Exclusion vs. bandwidth comparison table — immediately useful distinction
- Honest acknowledgment of residual format translation problem — builds trust
- Front-loaded opening claim — survives truncation well
- Well-constructed Relation to Site Perspective engaging three tenets
- Overall problem → failed responses → framework response → residual structure

### Enhancements Made
- Split opening paragraph for readability
- Added epiphenomenalism response paragraph with automaticity argument
- Improved fairness to physicalist identity response
- Strengthened Stapp hedging per writing style guide restraint policy
- Added Norretranders citation for 10⁹ bits/second figure
- Clarified "conscious throughput" → "behavioural measurements place the throughput of conscious processing" for precision

### Cross-links Added
No new cross-links needed — the article's existing link network is comprehensive, connecting to mental-causation, downward-causation, causal-closure, consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns, psychophysical-laws, selection-laws, attention-as-interface, and the tenets.

## Remaining Items
None. All medium issues were addressed in this review.

## Stability Notes
- The MWI objection (Deutsch persona) is a bedrock philosophical disagreement per the Map's No Many Worlds tenet. Future reviews should not re-flag this.
- The eliminative materialist objection that hierarchical selection doesn't require dualism is a genuine philosophical standoff. The article correctly presents this as the Map's interactionist interpretation of a framework-neutral architecture. Future reviews should not treat this as a flaw.
- The testability concern (Popper persona) applies to all interactionist dualism, not this article specifically. Future reviews should not demand empirical predictions beyond what the broader framework provides.
