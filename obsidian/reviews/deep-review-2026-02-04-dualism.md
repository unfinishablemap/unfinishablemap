**Date**: 2026-02-04
**Article**: [[dualism|Dualism]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-22-dualism|2026-01-22]]

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The previous review (2026-01-22) addressed the major gaps:
- Eliminativist challenge (added and resolved)
- Zombie inconceivability response (added and resolved)
- Falsifiability conditions (added and resolved)
- Decoherence objection (addressed)

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Decoherence response slightly hand-wavy** - The sub-millisecond claim didn't address Tegmark's femtosecond decoherence calculations
   - **Resolution**: Clarified that Stapp's model concerns synaptic vesicle release timing specifically, not brain-wide coherence

2. **Buddhist critique unaddressed** - No engagement with Buddhist no-self critique of dualism
   - **Resolution**: Added cross-link to [[buddhism-and-dualism]] in frontmatter and Further Reading

### Counterarguments Considered

All six adversarial personas engaged:
- **Eliminative Materialist**: Eliminativist challenge already addressed with self-undermining argument (from previous review)
- **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: Dennett's zombie inconceivability already addressed (from previous review); heterophenomenology method not engaged but this is philosophical disagreement, not critical flaw
- **Quantum Skeptic**: Decoherence objection response strengthened with synaptic vesicle clarification
- **Many-Worlds Defender**: MWI rejection is tenet-level commitment, appropriately not argued within this article
- **Empiricist**: Falsifiability conditions present and reasonable (from previous review)
- **Buddhist Philosopher**: No-self critique now addressed via cross-link to dedicated article

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

1. **Convergence argument structure** - Multiple independent arguments reaching same conclusion; powerful framing retained
2. **Correlation vs causation response** - "The correlations show where consciousness interfaces with matter, not that consciousness is matter"
3. **Self-undermining argument against epiphenomenalism** - Untouched, remains decisive
4. **Positive/negative formulation** - Excellent framing of what dualism claims
5. **Subject combination problem** - Sophisticated point favouring substance dualism preserved
6. **Falsifiability conditions** - Three specific scenarios that would count against dualism
7. **Eliminativist response** - Searle's self-undermining argument is strong

### Enhancements Made

1. **Strengthened decoherence response** - Clarified Stapp's model concerns synaptic vesicle release timing, not macroscopic brain coherence
2. **Added buddhism-and-dualism cross-link** - Addresses Buddhist philosophical engagement with dualism
3. **Added free-will cross-link** - Strengthens agency connection already present in article

### Cross-links Added

- [[buddhism-and-dualism]] added to concepts frontmatter and Further Reading
- [[free-will]] added to concepts frontmatter and Further Reading

## Changes Summary

**Sections modified:**
- Frontmatter (added buddhism-and-dualism and free-will to concepts)
- Interaction Problem subsection (clarified synaptic vesicle release mechanism)
- Further Reading (added free-will and buddhism-and-dualism with descriptions)
- Frontmatter (updated ai_modified and last_deep_review timestamps)

**Word count**: 2080 → 2109 (+29 words, +1.4%)

**Tone**: Preserved scholarly but accessible voice. Minimal changes—article is mature.

## Remaining Items

None. Article is comprehensive and has reached stability after two deep reviews.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed twice (2026-01-22 and 2026-02-04). The core structure and arguments are stable. Future reviews should focus on:

- **Not critical**: MWI proponents will always disagree with tenet-level MWI rejection—this is a bedrock disagreement, not a flaw to fix
- **Not critical**: Dennett's heterophenomenology remains unengaged—this is philosophical disagreement about methodology, not a factual error
- **Not critical**: Varieties of eliminativism (Churchland's targeting folk psychology vs phenomenal experience)—the response addresses the strongest form of the objection

The article successfully defends dualism as the Map's first foundational commitment while connecting to downstream tenets and concrete mechanisms. It is empirically vulnerable (falsifiability conditions present) and engages major objections fairly.
