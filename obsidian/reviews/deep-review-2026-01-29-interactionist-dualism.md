# Deep Review: Interactionist Dualism

**Date**: 2026-01-29
**File**: obsidian/concepts/interactionist-dualism.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-25
**Review type**: Cross-review with delegatory-dualism.md

## Context

This review was triggered as a cross-review following the creation of `obsidian/topics/delegatory-dualism.md`. The purpose is to ensure the interactionist-dualism concept page properly acknowledges and integrates with Saad's 2025 delegatory dualism framework.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Six adversarial philosopher personas examined the document:

### Critical Issues Found
**None.** The previous review (2026-01-25) addressed all critical issues including length reduction. No new critical issues emerged.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing cross-reference to delegatory dualism**: The new delegatory-dualism.md article directly addresses the causal closure/exclusion problem with Saad's delegation framework. The interactionist-dualism article discussed the exclusion problem without acknowledging this recent (2025) contribution.
  - **Resolution**: Added delegatory dualism as a complementary response to the exclusion argument in "The Causal Closure Argument" section

### Counterarguments Previously Addressed
- Dennett's zombie conceivability objection (preserved)
- Eliminativism (preserved in objections table)
- Decoherence objection (preserved)

All prior resolutions remain intact.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

Six sympathetic philosopher personas examined the document:

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening summary front-loads core position
- Seven converging arguments structure
- Psychophysical laws framework (supervenience vs. causal laws distinction)
- Multi-mind collapse resolution with interface locality
- Falsifiability section's honest treatment
- Objections-responses table format
- Self-stultification argument

### Enhancements Made
- Added delegatory dualism as alternative/complementary response to exclusion argument
- Added Saad (2025) reference
- Added delegatory-dualism to concepts frontmatter and Further Reading

### Cross-links Added
- [[delegatory-dualism]]

## Changes Made

### Content Additions

1. **Causal Closure section restructured**: Now presents two responses to the exclusion argument:
   - Quantum response (existing content, slightly condensed)
   - Delegation response (new, referencing Saad 2025)

2. **Frontmatter**: Added `[[delegatory-dualism]]` to concepts list

3. **Further Reading**: Added delegatory-dualism to Related topics

4. **References**: Added Saad (2025) citation

### Word Count Change
- Before: 3492 words (140% of soft threshold)
- After: 3554 words (142% of soft threshold)
- Change: +62 words

The modest increase is justified for cross-review integration with important new content. The article remains below the 3500-word hard threshold for concepts.

## Remaining Items

None. The cross-review objective (integrate with delegatory-dualism.md) has been accomplished.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed three times (2026-01-19, 2026-01-25, 2026-01-29) and is stable:

- **Philosophical disagreements are expected**: Adversarial personas will always find the interactionist position unsatisfying. This represents fundamental philosophical disagreement, not fixable flaws.

- **Quantum vs. delegation approaches**: The article now presents both the quantum mechanism response and the delegation structure response to the exclusion problem. These are complementary, not competing—quantum interactionism specifies *where* consciousness interfaces with physics; delegatory dualism specifies *how* mental causation avoids overdetermination.

- **Length at soft-warning level**: At 3554 words, the article is above the 2500-word soft threshold but well below the 5000-word critical threshold. Future reviews should not add content without corresponding cuts.

Future reviews should focus on factual accuracy and cross-linking with new content rather than seeking structural changes.
