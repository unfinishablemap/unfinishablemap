# Deep Review: Near-Death Experiences

**Date**: 2026-01-31
**File**: obsidian/concepts/near-death-experiences.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-20

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. Previous review addressed all major structural gaps (falsifiability section, illusionist engagement, mysterian perspective, expanded MWI discussion).

### Medium Issues Found
- **Relative time reference**: "Research has accelerated significantly since 2022" is time-relative language that ages poorly. **Resolution**: Replaced with explicit dates: "A 2022 multidisciplinary consensus established standardized terminology, followed by multi-site prospective studies (AWARE II, 2023)..."

### Counterarguments Considered
All six adversarial personas engaged:
1. **Eliminative Materialist**: Would reject "consciousness" as natural kind; confabulation objection already addressed in illusionist section
2. **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: Illusionist section (from previous review) addresses heterophenomenology
3. **Quantum Skeptic**: Minimal Quantum Interaction appropriately hedged as speculative
4. **Many-Worlds Defender**: Previous review added substantial MWI engagement with haecceity argument
5. **Empiricist**: Falsifiability section (from previous review) provides five testable conditions
6. **Buddhist Philosopher**: Scope appropriate; filter-theory article has Buddhist parallels

### Attribution Verification
- Van Lommel 18% figure: Verified against source
- Parnia AWARE II statistics: Verified against research notes
- Peter Fenwick death date (November 2024): Verified via web search (died 22 November 2024)
- Borjigin gamma surge: Correctly attributed

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Strong opening with key statistics (40% awareness, 18% Van Lommel paradox)
- Paradox of heightened experience framing
- Whitehead/process philosophy section (unique contribution)
- Mysterian angle providing epistemic humility
- Comprehensive falsifiability section
- Balanced treatment of materialist explanations

### Enhancements Made
- Added [[process-philosophy]] cross-link in Whitehead section
- Added process-philosophy to frontmatter concepts
- Fixed time-relative language in opening paragraph

### Cross-links Added
- [[process-philosophy]]

## Remaining Items

None. Article has reached stability after two reviews.

## Stability Notes

This is the second deep review. The previous review (2026-01-20) addressed all major structural issues:
- Illusionist challenge section
- Mysterian angle section
- Process philosophy perspective
- Expanded No Many Worlds engagement
- Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet
- Falsifiability section

The article now shows convergence characteristics:
- All six adversarial personas find philosophical disagreements (expected) but no factual errors or critical gaps
- All six sympathetic personas identify preserved strengths
- Edits are minor refinements, not structural changes

Future reviews should NOT re-flag:
- "MWI proponents will find indexical argument unsatisfying" — bedrock philosophical disagreement
- "Eliminativists reject consciousness as natural kind" — fundamental metaposition incompatible with dualism
- "Illusionist response could be stronger" — already addressed; philosophical standoff, not fixable gap

The article is at 2783 words (111% of soft threshold) — future expansions require equivalent cuts.
