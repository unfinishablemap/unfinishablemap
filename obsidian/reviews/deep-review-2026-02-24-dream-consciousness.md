**Date**: 2026-02-24
**Article**: [[dream-consciousness|Dream Consciousness]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-23-dream-consciousness|2026-02-23]]
**Context**: Article flagged as orphan (no inbound links). Original task targeted archived `dream-consciousness-and-the-filter-model.md`; redirected to the living coalesced article.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None. The previous review (2026-02-23) addressed all critical issues during the coalesce.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing citation for aPFC claim**: The Max Planck Institutes prefrontal cortex finding (line 75) lacked a reference. **Resolution**: Added Baird et al. (2018) citation and reference.
- **Broken old-slug references across 10 files**: The coalesce operation on 2026-02-23 archived three articles (`lucid-dreaming-and-consciousness`, `dreams-problem-solving-and-consciousness`, `dream-consciousness-and-the-filter-model`) into `dream-consciousness`. However, 10 content files still referenced the old slugs in frontmatter and body text. While the sync system has redirect support, these are broken links in Obsidian. **Resolution**: Updated all references to point to `dream-consciousness`.
- **Stale hugo content files**: Three archived articles still had full-content copies in `hugo/content/topics/` without archive markers. **Resolution**: Removed stale files; archive copies at `hugo/content/archive/topics/` remain.

### Counterarguments Considered
- All adversarial personas' concerns from the previous review remain addressed. No new issues identified — the article is stable after two reviews.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Three-evidence opening structure (distinct state, problem-solving, two-way communication)
- Careful caveating of Konkoly 2026 study
- "What Would Challenge This View" section with five specific conditions
- Two-layer phenomenon (architectural vs. content constraints)
- Consistent parallel structure for production vs. filter models
- Honest engagement with illusionism and epiphenomenalism challenges

### Enhancements Made
- Added Baird et al. (2018) citation for aPFC volume claim
- Fixed 10 files with broken old-slug references (see cross-links below)
- Removed 3 stale hugo content files

### Cross-links Fixed (Old Slug → dream-consciousness)

**Frontmatter and body text updated in:**
1. [[dreams-and-consciousness]] — 2 old slugs in frontmatter, 4 inline references
2. [[sleep-and-consciousness]] — 1 old slug in frontmatter, 2 inline references
3. [[metacognition]] — 1 old slug in frontmatter, 3 inline references
4. [[dream-consciousness-void]] — 1 old slug in frontmatter, 2 inline references
5. [[consciousness-and-memory]] — 2 old slugs in frontmatter, 1 Further Reading entry
6. [[incubation-effect-and-unconscious-processing]] — 1 old slug in frontmatter, 2 inline references
7. [[phenomenology-of-imagination]] — 1 old slug in frontmatter, 1 Further Reading entry
8. [[neural-bandwidth-constraints-and-the-interface]] — 1 inline reference
9. [[phenomenology-of-agency-vs-passivity]] — 1 old slug in frontmatter, 1 inline reference
10. [[free-will]] — 1 old slug in frontmatter, 2 inline references

**Total**: 10 files updated, ~22 individual reference fixes

## Remaining Items

- The `dreams-and-consciousness.md` concept article now has substantial overlap with the coalesced `dream-consciousness.md` topic article. A future coalesce or condensation may be warranted to reduce redundancy.
- Review files and changelog archives still reference old slugs (intentionally not updated — these are historical records).

## Stability Notes

- The article reached stability with the 2026-02-23 review. This review's primary contribution was integration work (cross-linking), not content changes. The article itself required only a single missing citation fix.
- The filter model vs. production model debate remains a bedrock philosophical disagreement — not a flaw to fix.
- The No Many Worlds tenet connection remains the weakest link (inherent to the topic, not a writing problem).
- The orphan status has been substantially addressed: the article now has ~22 inbound references from 10 files, up from effectively zero usable links.
