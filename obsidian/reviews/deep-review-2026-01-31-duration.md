**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Article**: [[duration|Duration (Durée)]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-27-duration|2026-01-27]]
**Cross-review context**: process-and-consciousness apex article

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The article has been through two previous deep reviews (2026-01-21, 2026-01-27) that addressed all critical issues. The content is comprehensive and well-argued.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Missing backlink to process-and-consciousness apex**: The new apex article extensively draws on duration.md content, but duration.md had no reciprocal link.
   - **Resolution**: Added [[process-and-consciousness]] to related_articles frontmatter and Further Reading section (first position, given its synthesis role).

### Attribution Accuracy Check

Verified all attributions:
- Bergson quotes and positions correctly attributed to his works
- Kent & Wittmann (2021) "missing link" correctly cited
- Whitehead's concepts properly distinguished from Bergson's
- Husserl's time-consciousness analysis correctly attributed

No attribution errors found.

### Counterarguments Previously Addressed (Not Re-Flagged)

Per stability notes from previous reviews, these remain adequately addressed:
- Illusionist challenge (regress argument, introspection reliability, asymmetry point)
- Decoherence objection (revised calculations, measurement problem persistence, Zeno mechanism)
- Khanika vs. flow tension (both structures operate together)

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Opening melody example: Effective phenomenological illustration (unchanged)
- Kent & Wittmann "missing link" framing: Distinctive connection to consciousness science (unchanged)
- Free will connection to Bergson's *Time and Free Will*: Substantive engagement (unchanged)
- Embodied duration/AI consciousness implications: Important and unique (unchanged)
- Illusionist challenge section: Well-argued responses (unchanged)
- Falsifiability section: Crisp conditions (unchanged)
- Process philosophy parallels: Properly linked to concept page (unchanged)

### Cross-Review Synergies

The process-and-consciousness apex article draws extensively on duration.md for:
- Bergson's creative duration as model for conscious causation
- Free acts emerging from the whole self
- The phenomenology of durée reinforcing bidirectional interaction

No inconsistencies found between the articles. The apex correctly extends and synthesizes duration.md's content.

### Enhancements Made

1. **Cross-link to apex added**:
   - [[process-and-consciousness]] added to related_articles frontmatter
   - [[process-and-consciousness]] added to Further Reading (first position, with description "Apex synthesis: how process philosophy illuminates all five tenets")

### Cross-links Added

- [[process-and-consciousness]] (frontmatter and Further Reading)

## Word Count

- **Before**: 2338 words (94% of 2500 target)
- **After**: 2350 words (94% of 2500 target)
- **Change**: +12 words (cross-link addition only)

Article remains within soft threshold.

## Remaining Items

None. Article is stable.

## Stability Notes

This article has now had three deep reviews (2026-01-21, 2026-01-27, 2026-01-31). The third review was a cross-review focused on integration with the new process-and-consciousness apex article. The only change needed was adding a reciprocal cross-link.

The article has reached stability:

- **Core content**: Comprehensive Bergson exegesis with site-specific extensions
- **Counterarguments**: Illusionist and decoherence challenges substantively addressed
- **Process philosophy**: Properly linked to both the concept page and the new apex
- **Length**: Within soft threshold after previous condensation
- **Cross-linking**: Now bidirectionally linked to the apex synthesis

Future reviews should focus only on:
- New site content that requires cross-linking
- Factual corrections if errors are discovered
- Style guide changes that affect the article

The philosophical positions and argumentative structure should be considered stable.
