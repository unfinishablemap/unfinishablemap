**Article**: [[contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness|Contemplative Evidence for Consciousness]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-23b-contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness|2026-02-23]]
**Cross-review context**: [[contemplative-pathology-and-interface-malfunction|Contemplative Pathology and Interface Malfunction]]

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article remains stable from previous reviews. The cross-review with contemplative pathology revealed no factual errors, misattributions, or internal contradictions.

### Medium Issues Found
- [Missing pathology cross-link and methodological acknowledgment]: The article's five convergent findings include features (self-deconstruction, non-ordinary states, awareness-content distinction) that overlap phenomenologically with pathological conditions documented in the contemplative pathology article (depersonalisation, temporal fragmentation, involuntary witness states). The article did not acknowledge this methodological challenge. **Resolution**: Added a paragraph in "Where Convergence Fails" explaining the overlap and arguing it strengthens rather than undermines the structural claims — different causal pathways revealing the same interface components confirms genuine architectural features.

### Low Issues Noted
- Duplicate Weng et al. (2013) citation appeared in both Attentional Trainability and Evidence Against Epiphenomenalism sections. Removed from the former where it was less contextually relevant; retained in the latter where the phenomenological-quality argument requires it.
- Six references remain uncited in body text (Davidson et al. 2012, Lutz & Thompson 2003, Lutz et al. 2020, Parkinson et al. 2022, Petitmengin 2006, Thompson 2007). Noted as acceptable in prior review — broader bibliography is standard academic practice.
- AI refinement log (HTML comment) still present — awaiting human review per its own instruction.

### Attribution Accuracy Check
- **Misattribution check**: All claims correctly attributed. No issues.
- **Qualifier preservation check**: Appropriately calibrated throughout.
- **Position strength check**: "Favours but does not eliminate" calibration for NRP maintained.
- **Source/Map separation check**: Clean. Map's position explicitly labeled.
- **Self-contradiction check**: No internal contradictions.

### Counterarguments Considered (Cross-Review Focus)
- Eliminativist: convergent findings overlap with pathological states — could be shared failure modes rather than genuine properties. Article now addresses this directly: the overlap confirms structural features visible from both healthy and pathological directions.
- Physicalist: bidirectional causation as common ground — unchanged from prior reviews, article acknowledges this honestly.
- Empiricist: methodological boundary between discovery and destabilisation — article now notes this challenge explicitly.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Two-stage evidential structure (convergence → theory testing) — unchanged, remains elegant
- Honest NRP assessment — "favours" without "eliminating" — maintained
- "Where Convergence Fails" section — genuine intellectual honesty preserved
- Galilean exclusion cross-links — added in prior review, still effective
- Falsifiability section — concrete, defeasible predictions
- Cessation dissociation — appropriately weakened qualification maintained
- Comprehensive cross-linking (17+ wikilinks in body, 18 in Further Reading)

### Enhancements Made
- Added contemplative pathology paragraph in "Where Convergence Fails" — acknowledges overlap between convergent findings and pathological states while arguing this strengthens structural claims
- Added [[contemplative-pathology-and-interface-malfunction]] cross-link in body text, Further Reading, and related_articles frontmatter
- Removed duplicate Weng citation from Attentional Trainability section
- Tightened prose in 6 locations for length neutrality (ethical framing, Varela reference, NRP introduction, bidirectional tenet section, dualism tenet section, attentional trainability conclusion)

### Cross-links Added
- [[contemplative-pathology-and-interface-malfunction]] (1 body reference + Further Reading + related_articles frontmatter)

## Remaining Items

None. The cross-review integration is complete.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed four times (Feb 22 on predecessors, Feb 23 twice, Feb 24 cross-review). It has reached clear stability. This review's contribution was integrating insights from the new contemplative pathology article — a legitimate reason to revisit a stable article.

The pathology paragraph added to "Where Convergence Fails" is a genuine enhancement, not oscillation: it addresses a new article that didn't exist during prior reviews. Future reviews should not remove it unless the contemplative pathology article is archived or fundamentally revised.

All prior stability notes remain valid:
- Philosophical disagreements from adversarial personas are expected standoffs
- The NRP "favours but does not eliminate" calibration is a deliberate strength
- Simplified anattā treatment serves its comparative purpose
