**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Article**: [[phenomenology-of-the-edge|The Phenomenology of the Edge]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-19-phenomenology-of-the-edge|2026-01-19]]
**Context**: Cross-review considering scale-void insights

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. Previous review addressed critical issues; article is stable.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Scale-void not cross-referenced**: The scale-void article has directly parallel phenomenology ("collapse into metaphor," "successful manipulation without understanding," "vertigo without danger") that wasn't connected. **Resolution**: Added scale-void to related_articles, integrated scale-boundary into "Multiple edges" insight, added to Further Reading section.

- **Millière component count ambiguous**: Article said "six components" but listing was unclear. **Resolution**: Changed to "key components" and clarified the list (body ownership and body awareness as separate items).

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Dennett heterophenomenology objection**: Zero-person perspective reports could be verbal behavior not mapping to coherent phenomenology. Noted as medium issue; previous review indicated this is handled in witness-consciousness article.

- **Materialist neural noise objection**: Already addressed in previous review with the specificity/consistency argument. No changes needed.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening summary front-loads key claims (truncation-resilient)
- Edge-experience profile table organizes complex material clearly
- "Dissolving insight" distinct from ordinary forgetting
- Connection between upper edge (meditators) and lower edge (minimal consciousness)
- Strong tenet connections across dualism, Occam's limits, filter theory, bidirectional interaction

### Enhancements Made
- Integrated scale-void as fourth type of edge in "Multiple edges exist" insight
- Added scale-void to Further Reading with description
- Added description field to frontmatter (150-160 chars emphasizing human+AI collaboration)
- Clarified Millière component listing

### Cross-links Added
- [[scale-void]] added to related_articles
- [[scale-void]] added to Further Reading
- [[scale-void]] linked inline in "Multiple edges" section

## Remaining Items

None. Cross-review integration complete. Article now connects edge-phenomenology to scale-void as another manifestation of cognitive limits with distinct phenomenological signatures.

## Stability Notes

This is the second deep review. The article has reached stability:
- Core phenomenological framework is solid
- Tenet connections are substantive
- Cross-linking is comprehensive
- No philosophical disagreements flagged as critical (adversarial personas' objections are bedrock disagreements, not fixable flaws)

The scale-void integration was the specific task; it's been accomplished with minimal word-count impact (+27 words). Future reviews should NOT re-expand material the previous review stabilized unless content has been substantively modified.
