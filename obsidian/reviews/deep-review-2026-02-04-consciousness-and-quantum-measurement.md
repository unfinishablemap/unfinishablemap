**Date**: 2026-02-04
**Article**: [[consciousness-and-quantum-measurement|Consciousness and Quantum Measurement]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article is well-constructed with proper source attribution.

### Attribution Accuracy Check
- **PASSED**: Tomaz et al. 2025 quote correctly attributed
- **PASSED**: Wigner's abandonment of consciousness-collapse accurately noted with appropriate nuance
- **PASSED**: Stapp's framework correctly characterized as operating within orthodox quantum mechanics
- **PASSED**: Von Neumann's chain accurately described
- **PASSED**: No misattribution of Chalmers or other philosophers
- **PASSED**: Clear separation between source positions and Map interpretation

### Medium Issues Found
1. QBism bullet point lacked explanatory gloss: Added clarification that "collapse" becomes belief-updating
2. Knowledge argument parenthetical redundant: Removed "(Mary's Room)" as the link is self-explanatory
3. Libet problem lacked link: Added link to [[libet-experiments]]

### Counterarguments Considered
The article already handles counterarguments well:
- **Eliminative Materialist**: Addressed via the decoherence section and "Why Most Physicists Disagree"
- **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: The "What This Framework Cannot Do" section addresses predictive limitations honestly
- **Quantum Skeptic**: Tegmark's objection mentioned; decoherence treatment is fair
- **Many-Worlds Defender**: MWI given fair treatment with costs/benefits noted
- **Empiricist**: The article acknowledges unfalsifiability as a genuine cost
- **Buddhist Philosopher**: Not directly addressed, but the indexical dimension treatment engages with identity questions

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
1. Excellent opening summary that front-loads the key claim about structural parallel
2. The table comparing measurement problem and hard problem is highly effective
3. The "causal closure loophole" framing is clear and compelling
4. "What This Framework Cannot Do" section demonstrates intellectual honesty
5. Well-organized tenet connections section
6. Strong reference section with appropriate sources

### Enhancements Made
Minor link improvements only - the article was already well-constructed.

### Cross-links Added (Orphan Integration Focus)
The article had no inbound links. Added cross-references FROM:
- [[hard-problem-of-consciousness]] — In the quantum consciousness section
- [[measurement-problem]] — In the indexical dimension section
- [[quantum-consciousness]] — In the quantum opening section
- [[decoherence]] — In the basis/outcome selection distinction section
- [[causal-closure]] — In the minimal quantum interaction section

These cross-references establish the article's place in the site navigation and ensure readers following related topics will discover this synthesis.

## Remaining Items

None. The article is now well-integrated into the site structure with five inbound links from key related articles.

## Stability Notes

This is the first review of this article. The philosophical disagreements raised by adversarial personas (MWI defenders finding indexical arguments unsatisfying, eliminativists rejecting the hard problem premise) are bedrock disagreements reflecting the Map's tenet commitments, not issues to fix. Future reviews should not re-flag these as critical.

## Word Count

2246 words (75% of 3000 soft threshold) — within acceptable range, no condensation needed.
