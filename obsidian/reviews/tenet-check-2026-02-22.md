# Tenet Alignment Check

**Date**: 2026-02-22
**Files checked**: 372
**Errors**: 0
**Warnings**: 1
**Notes**: 1

## Summary

Comprehensive review of all 372 content files (196 topics, 176 concepts) against the five foundational tenets. The site maintains excellent tenet alignment overall. One warning and one informational note were identified, both in the topics section. No direct contradictions or endorsements of ruled-out positions were found anywhere.

All concept files pass cleanly, including the highest-risk articles that describe positions the tenets explicitly rule out (materialism, illusionism, many-worlds, functionalism, epiphenomenalism, panpsychism). These articles consistently discuss opposing views fairly while maintaining the Map's perspective, with explicit "Relation to Site Perspective" sections connecting content to the tenets.

## Warnings

### consciousness-and-counterfactual-reasoning.md
- **Tenet violated**: No Many Worlds
- **Issue**: The "Ontological Status of Counterfactuals" section discusses what would follow if many-worlds were true without clearly signaling that the Map rejects this interpretation entirely. The framing could be read as treating MWI as a metaphysically live option rather than a rejected one.
- **Quote**: "If many-worlds were true, counterfactual reasoning would be reasoning about real (though inaccessible) branches... This creates a philosophical puzzle. Counterfactual reasoning represents states of affairs that, on the Map's view, have no ontological home."
- **Recommendation**: Add a clearer signal at the start of the MWI discussion that the Map rejects this interpretation (per Tenet 4), before exploring what it would entail hypothetically. The existing phrase "on the Map's view" partially addresses this but could be strengthened.

## Notes

### consciousness-and-collective-intelligence.md
- **Tenet**: Dualism
- **Issue**: The article correctly argues groups lack consciousness because they lack the quantum-interface substrate. However, the argument structure could be read as implicitly endorsing functionalism—suggesting that if groups had the right substrate, they would necessarily be conscious. The Map's dualist position holds that consciousness requires both the right physical substrate and irreducible phenomenal properties; the substrate alone is insufficient.
- **Quote**: "A group of people has no analogous physical substrate... The communication channels between people — speech, gesture, writing — are classical, macroscopic, and far too coarse-grained to serve as a quantum consciousness interface."
- **Recommendation**: Consider clarifying that the Map's position requires more than just substrate—dualism holds consciousness involves irreducible non-physical properties that cannot be reduced to any physical organization, however sophisticated.

## Files Passing All Checks

All 370 remaining files pass tenet alignment verification. Notable observations:

**High-risk concept files with exemplary alignment:**
- **materialism.md** — Thoroughly critiques materialism from the Map's perspective
- **many-worlds.md** — Clearly presents MWI as rejected, with detailed rationale
- **illusionism.md** — Engages illusionism fairly while demonstrating its regress problems
- **functionalism.md** — Discusses functionalism's appeal while maintaining dualist critique
- **epiphenomenalism.md** — Robustly defends bidirectional interaction, including honest treatment of the AI-consciousness edge case
- **predictive-processing.md** — Shows how PP integrates with dualism, connecting to all five tenets
- **panpsychism.md** — Presents as alternative to materialism while noting combination problem

**Cross-cutting patterns:**
- Dualism (Tenet 1) is reinforced across virtually all files
- Bidirectional Interaction (Tenet 3) is the second most frequently referenced tenet
- No Many Worlds (Tenet 4) is consistently maintained in quantum-related articles
- Occam's Razor Has Limits (Tenet 5) is properly applied when discussing parsimony arguments
- All articles that discuss opposing views do so with clear framing ("physicalists argue...", "defenders of X claim...") without endorsing the ruled-out positions
