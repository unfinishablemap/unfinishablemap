**Article**: [[reasons-responsiveness|Reasons-Responsiveness]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Reliabilist response could be developed more fully**: The response that reliability presupposes truth as a norm is correct but could address the functionalist rejoinder more directly.
   - *Resolution*: Added a paragraph addressing the functionalist attempt to naturalise "ought" through evolutionary survival-conduciveness, showing this reduces epistemic norms inappropriately.

2. **Functionalist/Dennett challenge briefly engaged**: The article acknowledges that the distinction between genuine reasoning and pattern-matching is contested but doesn't fully engage with the functionalist view that "grasping" might just be a particular computational relationship.
   - *Resolution*: Added clarification about what would distinguish genuine reasons-responsiveness from simulation: whether the system responds differently to *why* versus *that* a conclusion follows.

3. **LLM section somewhat undermines core claim**: The acknowledgment that LLMs present a "genuine challenge case" could benefit from more precision about what distinguishes genuine reasons-responsiveness.
   - *Resolution*: Added key test criterion and noted that whether LLMs achieve this is precisely the question of consciousness.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative Materialist**: Neural processes may implement semantic content without irreducible normativity
  - Article already addresses via the conceptual irreducibility argument
- **Functionalist (Dennett)**: "Grasping" might be a computational relationship
  - Addressed by adding the "why vs that" test criterion
- **Quantum Skeptic**: Decoherence constraints on neural quantum effects
  - Article appropriately doesn't overcommit to quantum mechanisms
- **Buddhist non-self**: Who grasps reasons if no unified self?
  - Not addressed (appropriate given scope and dualist framework)

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- The Sellars space-of-reasons/space-of-causes distinction as philosophical foundation
- The table comparing lucky indeterminism to reasons-responsive selection (clear, effective)
- The phenomenological descriptions of deliberation as active engagement
- The connection to the argument from reason
- Epistemic humility about LLMs and the "genuine challenge case" acknowledgment
- Integration with multiple related concepts (free will, luck objection, agent causation)

### Enhancements Made
1. Added phenomenological point about the felt *valence* of reasons—the experiential quality of considerations *pressing* toward conclusions
2. Strengthened reliabilist response with functionalist counter-counter
3. Added key test for genuine reasons-responsiveness (why vs that distinction)
4. Linked to [[self-stultification]] (directly relevant to argument from reason)
5. Added [[process-and-consciousness]] to Further Reading

### Cross-links Added
- [[self-stultification]] (in text and Further Reading)
- [[process-and-consciousness]] (in Further Reading)

## Remaining Items

None. The article is in good shape for a first review. The medium issues identified were all addressable within the review, and the article maintains appropriate epistemic humility about contested questions (LLM consciousness, mechanism specifics).

## Stability Notes

The functionalist challenge to reasons-responsiveness is a bedrock philosophical disagreement. The article engages it fairly by:
1. Presenting the challenge (LLM section)
2. Offering a criterion for distinguishing genuine from simulated reasons-responsiveness
3. Acknowledging this remains contested

Future reviews should NOT re-flag "functionalists still disagree" as a critical issue—this is an expected philosophical standoff, not a fixable problem. The article's position is defensible; it need not convince everyone to be successful.

Similarly, the quantum mechanism connection is appropriately loose. The article correctly presents consciousness-selection as operating "where physics leaves outcomes undetermined" without overcommitting to specific quantum proposals. Future reviews should NOT demand more mechanism specificity—the philosophical argument is mechanism-independent.
