**Date**: 2026-01-22
**Article**: [[concepts/many-worlds|Against Many-Worlds]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Missing standard sections**: The Illusionist Challenge, Process Philosophy Perspective, What Would Challenge This View?, and Contemplative Evidence sections were missing (now standard for deep-reviewed articles). **Resolution**: Added all four sections with substantive content.

- **Decision-theoretic dismissal too brief**: Wallace's 2012 work on deriving Born rule from decision theory was mentioned but not engaged with in detail. Critics' responses were stated but not explained. **Resolution**: Added "The Decision-Theoretic Response" subsection that presents Wallace's argument fairly before explaining why it fails (presupposes indexical identity in the "caring" that grounds rationality constraints).

### Medium Issues Found
- **Relation to Site Perspective incomplete**: Original covered only 4 tenets; the No Many Worlds tenet itself—which this article is centrally about—was not discussed in its own subsection. **Resolution**: Expanded to full 5-tenet coverage with substantive analysis for each, including dedicated No Many Worlds subsection explaining why the tenet exists.

- **Missing cross-links**: Key concepts mentioned but not wikilinked: haecceity, illusionism, witness-consciousness, introspection, quantum-interpretations. **Resolution**: Added all cross-links in frontmatter concepts and throughout text where contextually appropriate.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Illusionist objection**: If phenomenal consciousness is illusory, there's no real subject to worry about branching. **Addressed** in new Illusionist Challenge section with regress response and contemplative evidence.

- **Self-locating uncertainty defense**: MWI defenders argue pre-measurement uncertainty is like ordinary indexical uncertainty. **Addressed**: Explained why this fails when all outcomes are equally real—there's no fact to be uncertain about.

- **Decision-theoretic derivations**: Wallace's claim that rationality constraints alone recover the Born rule. **Addressed**: New subsection explains why this presupposes what it tries to prove (the "I" whose interests matter).

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- The five-argument cumulative case structure is clear and well-organized
- The Parfit convergence section draws an insightful parallel that illuminates both problems
- The indexical argument is the strongest section and correctly positioned as "the Map's central objection"
- The "Why Many-Worlds Appeals" section demonstrates fair engagement with the opposing view
- The writing is confident without being dismissive of serious positions

### Enhancements Made
1. **The Illusionist Challenge section**: Added full section with regress response, contemplative evidence, and connection to introspection reliability
2. **Process Philosophy Perspective section**: Added Whitehead's framework as alternative lens—actual occasions, concrescence vs. branching, haecceity connection
3. **What Would Challenge This View? section**: Added 5 falsifiability conditions clarifying what would undermine the anti-MWI position
4. **Decision-Theoretic Response subsection**: Expanded engagement with Wallace's most sophisticated defense
5. **Expanded Relation to Site Perspective**: From 4 paragraphs to full 5-tenet analysis with dedicated subsections

### Cross-links Added
- [[haecceity]] (in indexical problem discussion and Process Philosophy section)
- [[illusionism]] (new section)
- [[witness-consciousness]] (contemplative evidence)
- [[introspection]] (reliability of phenomenal reports)
- [[quantum-interpretations]] (Further Reading)
