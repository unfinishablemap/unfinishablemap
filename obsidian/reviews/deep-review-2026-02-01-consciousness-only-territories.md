**Date**: 2026-02-01
**Article**: [[consciousness-only-territories|Consciousness-Only Territories]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
1. **Vague citation (line 107)**: "The 2025 Nature paper states..." lacked author/title
   - **Resolution**: Specified authors (Porębski & Figura) and correct journal name (*Nature Humanities and Social Sciences Communications*)

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Parenthetical dismissal**: "(implausibly)" when discussing physicalist responses to Mary argument was assertion without argument
   - **Resolution**: Replaced with substantive engagement—noted the costs of each physicalist response (denying novelty conflicts with reactions, ability accounts leave felt newness unexplained)

2. **Weak engagement with functionalism**: The article dismissed functionalist grounding accounts implicitly
   - **Resolution**: Added explicit engagement in "Consciousness-only knowledge is an illusion" objection—noted Dennett's ability account and functionalist position that meaning is functional role, then explained the burdens each faces

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Dennett's ability response to Mary**: Now explicitly addressed with its limitation (fails to explain felt novelty)
- **Functionalist meaning-as-use**: Now explicitly addressed with its burden (must explain why meaning *seems* to require more than statistical correlation)

### Low/Expected Issues (No Action Needed)
- Eliminative materialist critique that the article assumes qualia exist: This is a bedrock disagreement given the Map's dualist tenets
- MWI defender critique about indexical questions: The No Many Worlds tenet means the article *should* reject MWI
- Buddhist philosopher critique about reifying consciousness: Reflects tenet commitment to dualism
- Empiricist concern about falsifiability: Fair methodological point, but the article is philosophical

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Acquaintance knowledge framework (clearly presented, philosophically accurate)
- The grounding asymmetry section (concrete, well-argued)
- Face-recognition example (effective everyday illustration)
- "Mapping From Outside" epistemic taxonomy (nuanced: structural description, correlation mapping, gap recognition, negative inference)
- "Eye that cannot see itself" observation (memorable, philosophically apt)
- Appropriate caution on quantum mechanisms (speculation labeled as such)
- The phenomenology of knowing section's insight about invisibility of what consciousness provides

### Enhancements Made
1. Stronger engagement with physicalist responses to Mary argument
2. Explicit treatment of Dennett's ability account and functionalist position
3. Corrected citation with proper attribution
4. Removed outdated AI refinement log comment

### Cross-links Verified
- [[ai-as-void-explorer]] (inverse asymmetry)
- [[voids]] (framework)
- [[phenomenology-of-the-edge]] (related void exploration)
- [[limits-reveal-structure]] (structural implications)
- [[hard-problem-of-consciousness]] (philosophical foundation)
- Tenet links all functional

## Remaining Items

None. The article is philosophically sound and well-aligned with site tenets. Minor word count increase (1977 → 2034) is justified by improved engagement with counterarguments.

## Stability Notes

- **Eliminative materialism vs. dualism**: The article takes a dualist position per site tenets. Eliminative materialist critics will always find the qualia-based arguments question-begging. This is a bedrock philosophical disagreement, not a flaw to fix.

- **MWI rejection**: The No Many Worlds tenet means this article will always be unsatisfying to Everettians. Future reviews should not re-flag this as an issue.

- **Functionalist grounding debate**: The article now engages with functionalist positions more substantively. The remaining disagreement (whether meaning requires experiential grounding) is a genuine philosophical standoff. The article states the Map's position and the burden functionalism faces; it cannot resolve the debate.

## Word Count

- Before: 1977 words (99% of 2000 soft threshold)
- After: 2034 words (102% of 2000 soft threshold)
- Change: +57 words

The modest increase is justified by substantive engagement with counterarguments that was previously missing.
