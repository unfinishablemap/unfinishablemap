# Deep Review: The Measurement Problem

**Date**: 2026-01-25
**File**: obsidian/concepts/measurement-problem.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-25T19:07:36+00:00
**Word count**: 2502 → 2492 (-10 words)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Dennett attribution without citation**: The original text claimed Dennett "holds" specific positions about consciousness talk being confused, without citing sources.
   - **Resolution**: Reframed as "the functionalist response" rather than attributing beliefs to Dennett specifically. The argument is presented as the functionalist position without making unverified claims about individual philosophers' beliefs.

2. **Zombie argument question-begging**: The original presented zombie conceivability as "datum" without acknowledging that conceivability itself is contested by functionalists.
   - **Resolution**: Added acknowledgment that "conceivability is contested: functionalists argue we only *think* we can conceive zombies without smuggling in phenomenal concepts." Now notes "this cannot be proven from neutral ground."

3. **MWI indexical question treated uncharitably**: The original dismissed MWI's response to the indexical question without fairly presenting the strongest version of their position.
   - **Resolution**: Added the MWI proponent's argument that "there's no single 'you' before branching to be uncertain about—the question is as confused as asking which future-self you'll become tomorrow." The Map's counter now responds to this stronger formulation.

### Medium Issues Found

- **Epistemic vs ontological gap in causal closure**: The distinction between not knowing causes (epistemic) and there being no physical cause (ontological) could be clearer. *Deferred*—addressing would require expanding the section beyond length constraints.

- **Tegmark calculation weight**: The article notes the objection is "severe and potentially fatal" but then pivots to alternatives. *Retained as-is*—the current framing correctly notes the severity while acknowledging the Map's structural point survives if neural quantum mechanisms fail.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Eliminative materialist**: Consciousness vocabulary may not carve nature at joints → Article already notes disagreement is "bedrock"
- **Empiricist**: Unfalsifiability is damning → Article front-loads this as "honest limitation"
- **Buddhist**: Self-assumption may be confused → Not addressed; would require significant expansion

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- The "honest limitation" paragraph showing intellectual integrity
- The structural parallel between measurement problem and hard problem
- The treatment of haecceity as naming what needs explaining
- The interface locality resolution to multi-observer coordination
- The causal closure loophole analysis
- Overall epistemic humility while advancing the Map's position

### Enhancements Made

- Functionalist position now presented without unverifiable attribution
- Zombie conceivability explicitly marked as contested
- MWI position represented more charitably before countering
- Prose tightened in interpretation bullet list (-10 words net)

### Cross-links Preserved

- [[arguments-for-dualism]]
- [[mysterianism-cognitive-closure]]
- [[hard-problem-of-consciousness]]
- [[haecceity]]
- [[interface-locality]]
- [[prebiotic-collapse]]
- [[tenets]]

## Remaining Items

- Buddhist philosophical challenge to self-assumption not addressed (would require major expansion)
- Epistemic/ontological gap distinction in causal closure section could be sharper
- Could cite more recent experimental work constraining consciousness-collapse theories
