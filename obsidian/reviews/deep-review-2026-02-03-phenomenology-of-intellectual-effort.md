**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Article**: [[phenomenology-of-intellectual-effort|The Phenomenology of Intellectual Effort]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-01-phenomenology-of-intellectual-effort|2026-02-01]]
**Review focus**: Orphan integration—adding inbound links from related articles

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The previous review (2026-02-01) addressed all critical issues:
- Neuroplasticity claim now properly cited
- MWI argument appropriately qualified
- AI phenomenology claim appropriately hedged

### Medium Issues Found
- **Orphan status**: File had no inbound links from other articles. **Resolution**: Added cross-references from 6 related articles (see below).

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminativist objection**: Acknowledged in stability notes from previous review as bedrock disagreement
- **Buddhist no-self**: Acknowledged in stability notes from previous review as bedrock disagreement
- **Heterophenomenology challenge**: The article's phenomenological claims could be reframed as reports about experience rather than evidence for irreducibility—this is a methodological challenge rather than a critical flaw

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening framing distinguishing intellectual effort from attentional effort
- "Strain of holding together" section with cognitive load, active maintenance, integration pressure
- The compelling vs. forced distinction with phenomenological vividness
- The self-undermining argument for Occam's limits
- First-person perspective on logic passage (Nagel connection)
- "What Would Challenge This View?" section (epistemic humility)

### Enhancements Made
None to the target article—article is at 98% of soft threshold (2926/3000 words), so operating in length-neutral mode. Focus was on orphan integration through inbound links.

### Cross-links Added (from other articles TO this one)

1. **[[argument-from-reason]]** — Added link in consciousness section, connecting structural argument to phenomenological evidence
2. **[[mental-effort]]** — Added link distinguishing attentional effort from intellectual effort
3. **[[cognitive-phenomenology]]** — Added link in sudden insight section, connecting to complementary analysis
4. **[[phenomenology-of-understanding]]** — Added link in effort subsection, cross-referencing detailed treatment
5. **[[free-will]]** — Added link in phenomenology of effort point, extending to reasoning
6. **[[phenomenology-of-choice]]** — Added link connecting decision effort to reasoning effort

## Remaining Items

None. Article has reached stability. Orphan status resolved.

## Stability Notes

This article was previously reviewed on 2026-02-01 and found stable. This follow-up review focused specifically on orphan integration rather than content changes.

The following are philosophical disagreements rather than fixable problems (from previous review):

- **Eliminativist challenge**: The eliminativist will always find the appeal to phenomenology question-begging. This is a bedrock disagreement about the reality of phenomenal states.

- **Buddhist no-self**: The unified self presupposed by the argument conflicts with Buddhist impermanence. This is a deep metaphysical disagreement about the nature of selfhood.

- **Functionalist reduction**: Functionalists may insist that the "compelling vs forced" distinction is functionally explicable. The article relies on the linked argument-from-reason treatment rather than rehashing this debate.

These should NOT be re-flagged as critical in future reviews unless new content introduces inconsistencies.
