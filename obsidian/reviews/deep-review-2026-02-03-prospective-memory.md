**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Article**: [[prospective-memory|Prospective Memory and Future-Oriented Consciousness]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-20-prospective-memory|2026-01-20]]

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The previous review (2026-01-20) comprehensively addressed all critical issues including:
- Adding illusionist engagement section
- Expanding tenet coverage to all five tenets
- Adding falsifiability section
- Adding contemplative evidence
- Adding process philosophy perspective

### Medium Issues Found
- Behavioral claims about EFT effects (temporal discounting, goal-directed behavior) lacked inline citation. **Resolution**: Added Szpunar, Spreng, & Schacter (2014) citation.
- "Futuricity" introduced without noting it's this article's coinage. **Resolution**: Added "(our term for this temporal quale)" clarification.

### Counterarguments Considered
All major counterarguments were addressed in the previous review:
- Illusionist challenge (regress, introspection, asymmetry responses)
- Many-worlds compatibility (haecceity connection)
- Decoherence objection (biological precedent acknowledged)

No new counterarguments identified requiring response.

### Attribution Accuracy Check
- ✓ Einstein & McDaniel (1990) — PM definition and pop phenomenon correctly attributed
- ✓ Schacter & Addis (2007) — Constructive simulation hypothesis correctly attributed
- ✓ Patient KC — Double deficit correctly described
- ✓ Conway et al. (2016) — "Extended present" correctly attributed
- ✓ No misattributions, dropped qualifiers, or source/Map conflation detected

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear front-loaded opening summary
- Effective PM types taxonomy (time-based, event-based, activity-based)
- Compelling Patient KC evidence demonstrating bidirectional mental time travel
- Strong distal vs. proximal intention distinction addressing Libet challenge
- Futuricity as phenomenal parallel to pastness
- All five tenets substantively connected
- Process philosophy section integrates well
- Contemplative evidence grounds phenomenological claims
- Good cross-linking to related articles

### Enhancements Made
- Added citation for behavioral claims about EFT
- Clarified "futuricity" as article's coinage

### Cross-links Added
None needed — previous review established comprehensive cross-linking.

## Remaining Items

None. Article has reached stability.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed twice. The previous review (2026-01-20) addressed all structural issues comprehensively. This review found no critical issues and only minor refinements were needed.

**Bedrock disagreements (not flaws to fix):**
- MWI proponents will find the indexical identity argument unsatisfying — this is a fundamental philosophical disagreement
- Illusionists will reject futuricity as genuine phenomenology — the article already engages this with three responses
- Eliminative materialists will question the reality of temporal qualia — addressed in dualism tenet section

The article should be considered stable. Future reviews should focus on checking for factual accuracy and ensuring cross-links remain valid rather than seeking new structural changes.
