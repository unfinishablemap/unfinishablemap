# Pessimistic Review

**Date**: 2026-02-22
**Content reviewed**: obsidian/topics/temporal-ontology-and-consciousness.md

## Executive Summary

This article argues that temporal ontology and theories of consciousness form "package deals"—eternalism pairs with functionalism/illusionism, presentism with epiphenomenalism, and the growing block with dualist interactionism. While the central thesis is stimulating, the argument confuses philosophical associations with logical constraints, overstates the strength of the pairings, and contains several unsupported claims. The treatment of eternalism is particularly one-sided, dismissing it on phenomenological grounds while ignoring sophisticated eternalist accounts of temporal experience.

## Critiques by Philosopher

### The Eliminative Materialist

Patricia Churchland would challenge the article's central move: treating "temporal phenomenology" as a unified, reliable datum that metaphysics must accommodate. The article repeatedly appeals to "the phenomenology of temporal passage" as though this refers to a single, well-characterised phenomenon. But neuroscience decomposes temporal experience into multiple, dissociable processes: duration estimation, temporal ordering, succession perception, the experience of simultaneity, and the sense of "nowness." These rely on different neural mechanisms and can be independently disrupted.

The article treats the experience of flow as bedrock evidence. A Churchlandian would insist this folk-psychological characterisation may not carve nature at its joints. "Temporal flow" might be a confabulated narrative imposed on discrete neural updates—something neuroscience is better positioned to explain than metaphysics. Building an entire temporal ontology on preserving folk phenomenology is like building physics to preserve the appearance that the sun moves across the sky.

### The Hard-Nosed Physicalist

Dennett would focus on the article's claim that declaring temporal phenomenology illusory "is like building an epistemology that begins by declaring perception unreliable—technically possible, but it undermines the evidence base for the theory itself." Dennett would call this a false analogy. We *do* accept that perception is unreliable in numerous, well-documented ways—optical illusions, change blindness, inattentional blindness, memory distortion. Acknowledging perceptual unreliability has not destroyed epistemology; it has made it more sophisticated. Similarly, acknowledging that the experience of temporal flow is a user-illusion constructed by the brain's narrative machinery does not "undermine the evidence base." It provides a *better* explanation of the evidence.

The article's rhetorical move—"temporal phenomenology is among the most robust features of conscious experience"—is exactly the kind of intuition-inflation Dennett warns against. The sense of flow feels robust, but so does the sense that we see in rich detail across our visual field (we don't—foveation and saccadic updating create that illusion). Robustness of seeming is not evidence for veridicality.

### The Quantum Skeptic

Tegmark would raise alarms at the article's casual conflation of quantum collapse with the growing block's "growth mechanism." The article states: "The growing block needs a mechanism for growth, and consciousness-involving collapse provides one." This treats consciousness-driven collapse as an available mechanism when no experiment has ever detected consciousness influencing collapse outcomes. The article provides no physical model, no mathematical framework, and no discussion of timescales.

More fundamentally, the article never addresses why the growing block needs collapse *at all*. The growing block is a position in temporal metaphysics. Its "growth" could be underwritten by any physical process—thermodynamic irreversibility, entropy increase, or simply the structure of dynamical laws. Inserting consciousness-driven collapse as the growth mechanism is not a consequence of the growing block; it is a separate metaphysical thesis smuggled in.

### The Many-Worlds Defender

Deutsch would challenge two specific claims. First, that "Many-worlds requires eternalism (all branches equally real)." This conflates eternalism about time (B-theory, all times exist) with realism about branches (all measurement outcomes exist). These are related but distinct commitments. One could in principle hold a presentist many-worlds view in which only the current branching moment exists. The conflation is convenient for the article's argument but philosophically imprecise.

Second, the claim that "rejecting many-worlds and adopting the growing block are mutually reinforcing commitments." This implies a logical relationship, but the reinforcement is only that both positions deny something (MWI denies collapse; the growing block requires it). This is not mutual reinforcement—it is compatibility. Many positions are compatible without reinforcing each other.

Deutsch would also note that the article's treatment of indexical identity ("why am I *this* instance and not another?") in relation to MWI applies equally to the growing block. On the growing block, why is *now* the edge? The article acknowledges this objection but answers it circularly: "consciousness marks this edge because consciousness participates in the resolution." This is the same structure of non-explanation the article attributes to rival positions.

### The Empiricist

A Popperian would ask: what would falsify the "package deal" thesis? The article presents philosophical associations as constraints but provides no criterion for distinguishing a genuine constraint from a philosopher's aesthetic preference. If a philosopher coherently combines eternalism with robust non-illusionist consciousness (as some process philosophers attempt), does this falsify the package deal claim? Or will the thesis be adjusted to accommodate it?

The relativity objection is handled with remarkable brevity. The article's entire response is: "collapse events may define local presents that don't require a global simultaneity surface." This is a promissory note, not an argument. The tension between special relativity and a privileged present is among the most serious challenges to any non-B-theory temporal ontology, and it deserves far more than two sentences of hand-waving. Without a physical model of how collapse-defined local presents avoid superluminal signalling or preferred-frame effects, this remains speculation.

### The Buddhist Philosopher

Nagarjuna would question the article's assumption that temporal experience requires an ontological ground—that if flow feels real, something must *be* flowing. Buddhist philosophy of time, particularly in the Madhyamaka tradition, argues that time is empty of inherent existence. The experience of temporal passage arises dependently—through the interplay of memory, anticipation, and present awareness—without requiring a metaphysical substrate that "really flows."

The article reifies the growing edge into an ontological frontier where consciousness "constitutes new reality." This requires a subject standing at the edge, performing the constituting. But the Buddhist analysis dissolves this subject: there is no persistent experiencer accumulating a block. What appears as temporal passage is the arising and ceasing of momentary mental events, each empty of self-nature. The article's entire architecture depends on a substantial self that experiences genuine flow, and this self is exactly what Buddhist philosophy challenges.

## Critical Issues

### Issue 1: Association Confused with Logical Constraint
- **File**: temporal-ontology-and-consciousness.md
- **Location**: "Why the Pairings Hold" section and throughout
- **Problem**: The article claims temporal ontology "determines" and "constrains" what consciousness can be, but the arguments offered establish associations, not necessities. Eternalism does not logically *require* illusionism about temporal experience—it requires only that temporal passage is not a feature of fundamental ontology, which is compatible with a robust account of temporal experience as a real but derived phenomenon. The article's language ("determines," "constrains," "must be") overstates the strength of the connections.
- **Severity**: High
- **Recommendation**: Distinguish between logical constraint (if X then necessarily Y) and philosophical affinity (X coheres naturally with Y). The pairings may be tensions and tendencies, not package deals.

### Issue 2: Eternalism Treated Uncharitably
- **File**: temporal-ontology-and-consciousness.md
- **Location**: "Eternalism and the Consciousness Problem" section
- **Problem**: The article reduces eternalism's options to two: temporal experience is illusory, or eternalism is incomplete. This ignores sophisticated eternalist positions. For instance, some B-theorists argue that temporal experience is veridical about local temporal ordering and change while being non-veridical only about the metaphysical status of "passage." This is not illusionism about temporal experience—it is a nuanced position that preserves most of what matters about temporal phenomenology. The article collapses this middle ground.
- **Severity**: High
- **Recommendation**: Engage with at least one sophisticated eternalist account of temporal experience (e.g., Prosser's account of experiencing temporal passage within a block universe, or Hoerl's distinction between feeling that time passes and its actually passing). Then explain why the Map still finds these inadequate.

### Issue 3: Retrocausality Mentioned Without Explanation
- **File**: temporal-ontology-and-consciousness.md
- **Location**: Growing block section, paragraph on causal efficacy
- **Problem**: The article states "The Libet timing problem dissolves under retrocausal interpretations" but retrocausality is introduced without definition, explanation, or named-anchor pattern. This violates the writing style guide's requirement that forward references use the "explained below" pattern or inline definitions. A reader encountering this will not understand how retrocausality dissolves the Libet problem—it's a bare assertion of a highly counterintuitive claim.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Recommendation**: Either provide an inline explanation of how retrocausal interpretations address Libet's findings, or remove the parenthetical claim. As written, it reads as hand-waving away a serious empirical challenge.

### Issue 4: Circularity in the Growing Block Argument
- **File**: temporal-ontology-and-consciousness.md
- **Location**: "The hard problem deepens productively" paragraph
- **Problem**: The argument runs: physical processes occur within temporal structure → temporal structure is partly constituted by consciousness → therefore consciousness cannot be reduced to physical processes. But the second premise (temporal structure is partly constituted by consciousness) is not established independently—it is the very thesis being defended. The argument is circular: it assumes dualist interactionism to argue for the growing block, then uses the growing block to argue for dualist interactionism.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Recommendation**: Acknowledge the circularity explicitly and reframe it as a coherence argument (these positions support each other) rather than a derivation (one follows from the other). The article hints at this with "This circularity doesn't prove dualism" but then immediately uses it as evidence ("it reveals that...").

### Issue 5: Collapse as Growth Mechanism is Unargued
- **File**: temporal-ontology-and-consciousness.md
- **Location**: Growing block section
- **Problem**: The article asserts that "The growing block needs a mechanism for growth, and consciousness-involving collapse provides one" without considering alternative mechanisms. Thermodynamic irreversibility, spontaneous localisation (GRW theory), or even brute temporal passage could provide the growth mechanism without consciousness. The article presents consciousness-driven collapse as though it fills a genuine explanatory gap, but the gap is manufactured by ignoring other candidates.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Recommendation**: Briefly acknowledge that the growing block is compatible with non-consciousness-involving growth mechanisms, then explain why the Map's framework finds the consciousness-involving version more explanatory or coherent.

## Counterarguments to Address

### The B-Theory Temporal Experience Challenge
- **Current content says**: Eternalism forces temporal experience to be "non-veridical" and incompatible with dualism
- **A critic would argue**: B-theorists like Mellor, Prosser, and Hoerl have developed sophisticated accounts where temporal experience is veridical about change, ordering, and duration while not requiring ontological passage. Temporal experience can be "about" real temporal relations (earlier-than, later-than, simultaneous-with) without requiring a moving present. This preserves robust temporal phenomenology within eternalism.
- **Suggested response**: Engage specifically with one such account and explain what the Map's dualism requires that even sophisticated B-theory temporal experience cannot provide.

### The Presentist Dualist
- **Current content says**: Presentism pairs with epiphenomenalism or deflationary consciousness
- **A critic would argue**: William Lane Craig explicitly combines presentism with robust dualism about consciousness. Dean Zimmerman defends presentist accounts of temporal experience. The article's claim that presentism "pushes toward" deflationary consciousness is historically contradicted by actual presentist philosophers, many of whom are substance dualists.
- **Suggested response**: Acknowledge that the pairing is a tendency rather than a constraint, or explain specifically what about the Map's *interactionist* dualism (not just dualism generally) makes presentism unsuitable.

### Relativity as a Stronger Objection Than Acknowledged
- **Current content says**: The growing block "need not identify the growth frontier with a single hyperplane of simultaneity"
- **A critic would argue**: This response is inadequate. If there is no global simultaneity surface, what determines the shape of the "growth frontier"? Different reference frames would disagree about which events have "already happened." The growing block must either privilege a frame (violating the principle of relativity) or make the growth frontier frame-dependent (incoherent—reality cannot have grown to include event E relative to frame F but not frame F'). This is the central objection to the growing block and deserves serious engagement.
- **Suggested response**: Discuss proposals for Lorentz-invariant growing blocks (e.g., Tooley's point-by-point growth) or acknowledge this as a genuine open problem for the position.

## Unsupported Claims

| Claim | Location | Needed Support |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| "positions on time and positions on consciousness are not independent" | Opening paragraph | Needs to distinguish logical constraint from philosophical affinity; no deductive argument is provided |
| "the growing block [...] turns out to be the temporal ontology most naturally paired with dualist interactionism" | Opening paragraph | "Most naturally" is evaluative; no comparison metric offered |
| "Eternalism is the default assumption in modern physics" | Eternalism section | Overstated; many physicists remain agnostic about temporal ontology. Citation would help |
| "collapse events may define local presents that don't require a global simultaneity surface" | Objections section | No citation, no physical model, no engagement with the extensive literature on this problem |
| "The Libet timing problem dissolves under retrocausal interpretations" | Growing block section | No explanation of how; "dissolves" is extremely strong for a parenthetical claim |
| "Consciousness marks this edge because consciousness participates in the resolution" | The "now" problem response | Circular—uses the thesis to answer the objection to the thesis |

## Language Improvements

| Current | Issue | Suggested |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| "turns out to be" | Implies discovery; this is an argument | "is, the Map argues," |
| "These pairings are not accidental" | Too strong without demonstrated mechanism | "These pairings reflect deep structural connections" |
| "dissolves" (re: Libet) | Far too strong for an unexplained parenthetical | "can be reframed under" or remove entirely |
| "the temporal ontology most naturally paired" | "Most naturally" implies objective ranking | "a temporal ontology well-suited to" |
| "consciousness operates at the ontological frontier" | Asserted as consequence; actually a separate thesis | Introduce as the Map's additional claim rather than a deduction |

## Strengths (Brief)

Despite significant criticisms, the article has genuine merits worth preserving:

- **The central thesis is genuinely interesting.** The idea that temporal ontology and consciousness theories constrain each other is under-explored in philosophy and adds real value. The problem is overstating the constraints, not the observation itself.
- **The theory-by-theory analysis of the pain asymbolia article's style is effective.** Walking through eternalism, presentism, and the growing block systematically makes the argument accessible and structured.
- **The Bergson connection is well-placed.** Invoking durée gives the article philosophical depth and connects it to an under-appreciated tradition.
- **The article is well-structured for LLM consumption.** The opening paragraph front-loads the thesis effectively, sections are self-contained, and the "Relation to Site Perspective" section is thorough.
- **Genuine engagement with objections.** The "Objections and Responses" section acknowledges real challenges rather than ignoring them (even if the responses need strengthening).
