**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article has proper structure, no factual errors, and includes the required "Relation to Site Perspective" section with substantive connections to all five tenets.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **One-sided treatment of MWI**: The article cited Friederich and Dawid's criticisms of self-locating uncertainty without acknowledging Wallace's decision-theoretic defense. **Resolution**: Added acknowledgment of Wallace (2012) and noted that even sophisticated defenses make indexical identity primitive.

2. **Physics/philosophy distinction unclear**: The measurement question and indexical question were stated but their logical independence wasn't emphasized. **Resolution**: Added explicit "(physics)" and "(philosophy)" labels and a paragraph explaining that these questions are logically independent.

3. **No empirical testability acknowledgment**: The "indexical reading" of Born probabilities was proposed without noting its metaphysical rather than empirical status. **Resolution**: Added "Empirical status" paragraph acknowledging the proposal is currently metaphysical and doesn't yield novel predictions.

### Counterarguments Considered

**From Eliminative Materialist**: "Consciousness may be a folk concept destined for elimination."
- *Assessment*: This represents a bedrock philosophical disagreement with the Map's Dualism tenet, not a fixable flaw.

**From Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: "Heterophenomenology can capture indexical reports functionally."
- *Assessment*: Fundamental disagreement; the article's position that indexical facts are irreducible is a tenet commitment.

**From Quantum Skeptic**: "The indexical question is philosophy dressed in physics language."
- *Assessment*: Valid concern; addressed by clarifying the physics/philosophy distinction.

**From MWI Defender**: "Self-locating uncertainty is coherent; Wallace has responded to critics."
- *Assessment*: Valid concern; addressed by acknowledging Wallace's defense while noting it still presupposes a subject.

**From Empiricist**: "What predictions does this make?"
- *Assessment*: Valid concern; addressed by adding "Empirical status" section acknowledging metaphysical nature.

**From Buddhist Philosopher**: "The self is empty; there is no 'this consciousness' to ground."
- *Assessment*: The haecceity article addresses this more fully; the response there (haecceity about processes rather than substances) applies here too.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- The core distinction between measurement question and indexical question
- Systematic survey of how each QM interpretation fails to address the indexical gap
- The novel "indexical reading" of Born probabilities
- The "consciousness as indexical ground" proposal avoiding Wigner's solipsism trap
- Excellent front-loaded opening summary
- Strong "Relation to Site Perspective" section connecting to all five tenets
- Effective use of italicized *this* and *I* for emphasis

### Enhancements Made
1. Clarified physics/philosophy distinction with explicit labels and explanation of logical independence
2. Balanced MWI treatment by acknowledging Wallace's decision-theoretic defense
3. Added "Empirical status" paragraph for intellectual honesty about testability
4. Added free-will cross-link in Further Reading section

### Cross-links Added
- [[topics/free-will]] — connection to libertarian free will if consciousness grounds indexical determination

## Word Count

**Before**: 1947 words
**After**: 2138 words (+191, 10% increase)
**Status**: Well under soft threshold (3000)

## Remaining Items

None. All medium issues addressed; low issues (additional Buddhist engagement, broader functionalist response) are adequately handled by existing cross-links to the haecceity article.

## Stability Notes

The following represent fundamental philosophical disagreements rather than fixable problems:

- **Eliminative materialism**: The position that "consciousness" is a folk concept will always find this article's premise objectionable. This reflects tenet commitment, not article flaw.

- **Hard-nosed physicalism**: Dennett-style heterophenomenology claims to capture everything about indexicals functionally. The article presupposes this is wrong (per Dualism tenet).

- **Anti-haecceitism**: Parfit-style views that personal identity reduces to psychological continuity will reject the article's core premise. This is a bedrock metaphysical disagreement.

Future reviews should NOT re-flag these as critical issues. The article has now been marked as reviewed; any future modifications should prompt a new review cycle.
