# Deep Review: Prospective Memory and Future-Oriented Consciousness

**Date**: 2026-01-20
**File**: obsidian/concepts/prospective-memory.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Missing illusionist engagement**: Article asserted futuricity quale without addressing the illusionist challenge that this may be introspective confabulation. Resolution: Added comprehensive "The Illusionist Challenge" section with three defenses (regress problem, introspection phenomenology, asymmetry argument).

- **Incomplete tenet coverage**: Only covered 3 of 5 tenets (missing Minimal Quantum Interaction and Occam's Razor Has Limits). Resolution: Expanded "Relation to Site Perspective" to cover all 5 tenets with substantive connections.

### Medium Issues Found
- **No falsifiability section**: Article lacked "What Would Challenge This View?" section providing testable predictions. Resolution: Added section with 5 specific conditions that would challenge the view.

- **Missing contemplative evidence**: Unlike other recently reviewed articles, no section on contemplative/meditative evidence for the phenomenological claims. Resolution: Added "Contemplative Evidence" section covering witness consciousness, intention phenomenology, and worry-obsession contrast.

- **No process philosophy perspective**: Other memory-related articles include Whitehead's framework for understanding why phenomenology is required. Resolution: Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section connecting subjective aim, eternal objects, and concrescence to prospective memory.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Illusionist challenge**: Futuricity as introspective confabulation - addressed with regress, introspection, and asymmetry responses
- **Many-worlds compatibility**: Whether deliberation makes sense in branching universes - addressed in No Many Worlds tenet section with haecceity connection
- **Decoherence objection**: Whether quantum mechanisms could operate at neural timescales - acknowledged with biological precedent response

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent opening summary that front-loads the key concept
- Strong Patient KC evidence demonstrating bidirectional mental time travel
- Effective comparison table (remembering vs future simulation)
- Clear exposition of time-based, event-based, and activity-based PM types
- Good distal vs proximal intention distinction addressing Libet challenge
- Strong existing connection to Bidirectional Interaction tenet

### Enhancements Made
- Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section with three-part defense
- Added "Contemplative Evidence" section with witness consciousness, intention phenomenology, and worry-obsession contrast
- Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section connecting Whitehead's framework
- Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section with 5 falsifiability conditions
- Expanded "Relation to Site Perspective" from 3 tenets to all 5
- Enhanced No Many Worlds section with haecceity connection
- Connected distal intentions to motor-selection research in Agent Causation section

### Cross-links Added
- [[episodic-memory]] - pastward mental time travel complement
- [[illusionism]] - the radical challenge to phenomenal claims
- [[introspection]] - first-person access to prospective phenomenology
- [[witness-consciousness]] - observing future simulations
- [[decoherence]] - quantum coherence challenges
- [[haecceity]] - indexical grounding for future reference
- [[mental-effort]] - quantum Zeno mechanism
- [[attention-as-interface]] - consciousness-brain interface
- [[motor-selection]] - willed movement and selection interface

### References Added
- Szpunar, Spreng, & Schacter (2014) - taxonomy of prospection
- Frankish (2016) - illusionism theory
- Tallis (2016) - critique of illusionism
- Whitehead (1929) - process philosophy
