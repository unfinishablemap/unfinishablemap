**Date**: 2026-01-27
**Article**: [[libet-experiments|Libet Experiments]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-20-libet-experiments|2026-01-20]]
**Cross-review context**: quantum-measurement-and-subjective-probability.md

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The previous review (2026-01-20) addressed all critical issues including:
- Adding falsifiability section (resolved)
- Adding illusionism engagement (resolved)
- Adding decoherence challenge section (resolved)

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Indexical gap not acknowledged** — The quantum-measurement article critiques consciousness-collapse theories for facing an "indexical gap": even if consciousness selects outcomes, this doesn't explain why *this* consciousness exists to select *this* outcome. The same critique applies to the Map's retrocausal selection model.
   - **Resolution**: Added new paragraph in "Relation to Site Perspective" section acknowledging this as an open problem distinct from causal efficacy.

2. **Missing cross-link to quantum-measurement-and-subjective-probability.md** — The quantum-measurement article's critique of QBism's phenomenological gap and its discussion of epistemic vs. ontic participation directly supports the Libet article's position.
   - **Resolution**: Added to related_articles frontmatter and Further Reading section.

3. **Missing cross-link to phenomenal-consciousness.md** — The article discusses the reality of conscious experience without linking to the concept page.
   - **Resolution**: Added to concepts frontmatter and Further Reading section.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Eliminative materialist**: The 60% prediction gap could reflect measurement limitations, not a gap for consciousness.
  - **Response**: Already addressed in falsifiability section (point 1) from previous review.

- **Quantum skeptic (Tegmark)**: The indexical problem applies to the Map's position too.
  - **Response**: Acknowledged explicitly in new indexical gap paragraph—the Map addresses causal efficacy, not the hard problem of why experience exists.

- **Hard-nosed physicalist (Dennett)**: The illusionism engagement is adequate.
  - **Response**: Previous review resolved this; no re-flagging needed.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

1. Schurger/Sjöberg critique remains devastating to standard interpretation
2. Selection vs. initiation framing is philosophically sophisticated
3. Process philosophy section offers non-substantial alternative
4. Falsifiability section shows intellectual honesty
5. Comprehensive cross-linking from previous review maintained

### Enhancements Made

1. **Added indexical gap acknowledgment** — Shows awareness that the Map's position faces the same deeper problem as consciousness-collapse theories, while distinguishing this from the causal efficacy question Libet addresses.

2. **Cross-linked to quantum-measurement-and-subjective-probability.md** — Connects the phenomenological argument (determinate experience prior to belief) to the Libet discussion.

3. **Cross-linked to phenomenal-consciousness.md** — Properly references the concept page for qualitative experience.

### Cross-links Added

- [[quantum-measurement-and-subjective-probability]] — Why subjective probability interpretations fail phenomenologically
- [[phenomenal-consciousness]] — The reality of qualitative experience

## Remaining Items

None. The article now:
- Acknowledges the indexical gap honestly as an open problem
- Cross-links to the quantum-measurement article for convergent support
- Maintains all strengths from previous review
- Stays within soft_warning length threshold (2957 words, 118% of 2500)

## Stability Notes

**Philosophical disagreements (not critical issues):**
- MWI proponents will always find the retrocausal framework question-begging—this is a bedrock disagreement covered by the No Many Worlds tenet
- Eliminativists will always find appeals to phenomenal consciousness question-begging—this is a tenet-level commitment
- The indexical gap is now acknowledged rather than hidden; future reviews should not re-flag it as critical

**Convergence assessment:** This article has reached stability. The previous review (2026-01-20) addressed structural gaps. This review integrated insights from the quantum-measurement article and added appropriate cross-links. No further structural changes needed unless new content is published that requires integration.

## Metrics

- Word count: 2857 → 2957 (+100 words)
- Critical issues addressed: 0 (none found)
- Medium issues addressed: 3
- Cross-links added: 2 (quantum-measurement-and-subjective-probability, phenomenal-consciousness)
