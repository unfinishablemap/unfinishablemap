**Date**: 2026-02-24
**Article**: [[neural-bandwidth-constraints-and-the-interface|Neural Bandwidth Constraints and the Interface]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-24-neural-bandwidth-constraints-and-the-interface|2026-02-24]]
**Cross-review context**: Reviewing in light of [[bandwidth-problem-mental-causation]] insights

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. This is the third review. All critical issues were resolved in the first review (2026-02-10): unverifiable table data, cherry-picked reading rate, optic nerve figure, Schwartz interpretation conflation. No regression detected.

### Medium Issues Found

- **Stale concept link to archived article**: `[[psychophysical-coupling]]` in concepts frontmatter pointed to an archived article superseded by `psychophysical-laws`. **Resolution**: Updated to `[[psychophysical-laws]]`.

- **Connecting paragraph missed format dimension of bandwidth problem**: The companion article (bandwidth-problem-mental-causation) distinguishes three dimensions of the challenge: capacity, grain, and format. The topic article's connecting paragraph mentioned only "specificity," omitting the format translation problem (how intentional content maps to physical mechanisms). **Resolution**: Rewrote the connecting paragraph to explicitly name all three dimensions, note which the hierarchical selection architecture addresses (capacity, grain) and which remains open (format), with a cross-link to psychophysical-laws for the coupling problem.

### Counterarguments Considered

All six adversarial personas engaged. No new counterarguments beyond those identified in prior reviews (2026-02-10, 2026-02-24). All remain bedrock philosophical disagreements:

- **Eliminative Materialist**: "Conscious processing rate" conflates behavioral output with consciousness. Expected disagreement.
- **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: CEO analogy smuggles in a homunculus. Acknowledged as analogy.
- **Quantum Skeptic**: Bandwidth-to-quantum connection unentailed by data. Bedrock.
- **Many-Worlds Defender**: Per-branch objection acknowledged in prior revision.
- **Empiricist**: Falsification section remains a strength. No new issues.
- **Buddhist Philosopher**: Conscious/unconscious boundary assumed. Framework-level disagreement.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Opening paragraph: quantitative, front-loaded, truncation-resilient
- "Factory with a million workers" and CEO analogies
- William James's prism analogy
- "You cannot choose among options that haven't been prepared yet"
- "Constrained authorship" framing
- Falsification section with four specific conditions
- All five tenet connections
- Automatisation section's interface model reading
- Schwartz interpretation (properly qualified)
- Bidirectional bandwidth-problem link (established in prior review)

### Enhancements Made

- Rewrote bandwidth-problem connecting paragraph to surface all three dimensions (capacity, grain, format) from the companion article, explicitly noting which are resolved and which remain open
- Fixed stale frontmatter link from archived psychophysical-coupling to current psychophysical-laws

### Cross-links Added

No new cross-links needed. The existing link set is comprehensive:
- [[bandwidth-problem-mental-causation]] (bidirectional link confirmed)
- [[psychophysical-laws]] (updated from archived psychophysical-coupling)

## Remaining Items

- Carhart-Harris entropic brain citation remains absent for the psychedelic prediction. Low priority—flagged in all three reviews but the claim is qualified and the reference is findable.
- Comparative bandwidth across species remains unexplored. Future article opportunity, not a gap in this article.

## Stability Notes

- **This article has reached stability.** Three reviews over two weeks have progressively refined it from initial factual corrections through cross-link establishment to fine-grained integration with companion content. No critical issues in the last two reviews; medium issues have been targeted and narrow.
- All six adversarial persona disagreements are bedrock philosophical standoffs. Future reviews should NOT re-flag: eliminativist category skepticism, GWT sufficiency claims, quantum mechanism skepticism, MWI per-branch objection, homunculus concern with CEO analogy.
- The bandwidth-problem-mental-causation connection is now mature: the topic article surfaces the three-dimensional structure of the challenge and links to the concept article for detailed treatment. Future reviews should verify this linkage is maintained if either article is modified.
- **Recommendation**: Unless the article is substantively modified or new companion content is created, no further deep reviews are needed. The article is stable.
