## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The previous review (2026-01-21) addressed the major issues:
- No Many Worlds argument was rewritten around indexical identity
- Illusionist section was strengthened with Frankish's quasi-phenomenal framework
- Quantum mechanism section was properly qualified as speculative

### Medium Issues Found
- **Working memory claim lacked citation**: "curiosity appears to expand working memory capacity" was an unsupported specific claim. Resolution: Softened to "curiosity may enhance processing resources"—still captures the idea without overclaiming.

- **Falsifiability condition underspecified**: Condition 1 (perfect functional reduction) was vague about what would count. Resolution: Added "all verbal reports, and all introspective judgments while showing why these exhaust the phenomenon" to make the condition more operationalizable.

### Counterarguments Considered
All major counterarguments were addressed in the previous review:
- Frankish's quasi-phenomenal framework (regress argument response present)
- MWI's branch-relative determinacy (indexical identity response present)
- Timescale objection to quantum mechanisms (acknowledged as speculative)

No new counterarguments emerged requiring response.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Tip-of-the-tongue phenomenology as evidence for cognitive phenomenology (excellent test case)
- Layered metacognitive structure (first-order/second-order/third-order) clearly explained
- Specific phenomenological vocabulary for each emotion (information gap detection, bifurcation, active failure)
- Error-blindness analysis (doubt as proxy for error detection)
- Contemplative tradition vocabulary (aporia, beginner's mind, great doubt, vedanā)
- Causal efficacy argument supporting bidirectional interaction tenet
- Falsifiability section with specific conditions

### Enhancements Made
- Softened working memory claim to avoid overclaiming (~5 words changed)
- Tightened falsifiability condition 1 to specify what would count (~15 words added)

### Cross-links Added
None needed—article already has comprehensive cross-linking to 11 related concepts.

None. Article has reached stability.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed twice. The first review (2026-01-21) made substantial improvements addressing the No Many Worlds argument, illusionist engagement, and quantum speculation. This second review found no critical issues and made only minor refinements.

**Philosophical disagreements that are NOT issues to fix:**
- Eliminative materialists will reject the claim that phenomenal character exists beyond function
- Hard-nosed physicalists will argue heterophenomenology exhausts the phenomenon
- Many-Worlds defenders will find the indexical identity argument unsatisfying

These represent bedrock differences between the Map's dualist framework and materialist/functionalist alternatives. Future reviews should not re-flag these as problems—they are expected consequences of the Map's tenet commitments.

**The article is stable.** Unless significant new content is added or external critique identifies specific errors, this article should not require further deep review.
