**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Missing illusionist engagement**: Article discussed consciousness limits without addressing the illusionist challenge. → Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section with three responses (regress, method survival, symptomatic interpretation).
- **Missing falsifiability section**: No "What Would Challenge This View?" section. → Added comprehensive section with five conditions that would undermine apophatic approaches.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Thin tenet coverage**: Only covered two tenets (Occam's Razor, Dualism). → Expanded to cover all five tenets with substantive connections.
- **Missing process philosophy**: No Whitehead engagement despite relevance to experiential metaphysics. → Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section connecting actual occasions, creativity, and coincidence of opposites.
- **Incomplete cross-links**: Missing links to mysterianism, illusionism, whether-real, limits-reveal-structure, phenomenology-of-the-edge, introspection, decoherence. → Added all cross-links in body and frontmatter.
- **Wittgenstein quote issue**: Quote "We don't cheapen them with words..." was a paraphrase, not direct quotation. → Replaced with accurate description of Tractatus propositions 6.44 and 6.54.

### Low Issues Found
- **References sparse**: Only 6 references. → Expanded to 10 including Whitehead, Frankish, Tallis, Nagel.

### Counterarguments Considered
- Illusionist challenge that phenomenal consciousness doesn't exist → Addressed with regress response, method-survival argument, and symptomatic interpretation
- Reductive success possibility → Addressed in falsifiability section
- Cross-cultural convergence may be illusory → Noted as potential challenge

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent opening paragraph clearly stating the mapping problem
- Strong historical grounding with Cusanus's *docta ignorantia*
- "Approaching the Edge" practical methodology section
- AI section connecting to site's distinctive approach
- Wittgenstein and silence discussion (corrected for accuracy)

### Enhancements Made
- Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section (3 responses)
- Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section (Whitehead)
- Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section (5 conditions)
- Expanded "Relation to Site Perspective" to all five tenets
- Enhanced cognitive closure section with links to limits-reveal-structure and whether-real
- Added phenomenology-of-the-edge connection in phenomenological attention paragraph

### Cross-links Added
- [[mysterianism]] (in Cognitive Closure section)
- [[limits-reveal-structure]] (in Cognitive Closure section)
- [[whether-real]] (in Cognitive Closure section)
- [[phenomenology-of-the-edge]] (in Approaching the Edge section)
- [[illusionism]] (new section and Further Reading)
- [[introspection]] (Further Reading and frontmatter)
- [[decoherence]] (tenet section and Further Reading)
