**Date**: 2026-01-29
**Article**: [[consciousness-and-intelligence|Consciousness and Intelligence]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-29-consciousness-and-intelligence|2026-01-29 (earlier today)]]

## Context

This is a second review conducted on the same day as the initial deep review. The first review addressed all critical issues and documented bedrock philosophical disagreements. This review focused on verification and attribution accuracy.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The previous review addressed all critical issues.

### Medium Issues Found
- **"Zone of latent solutions" attribution**: The article attributed the ZLS concept solely to "Tomasello" when it was introduced by Tennie, Call, and Tomasello (2009). Additionally, the Tomasello 2010 citation was missing co-author Esther Herrmann. Resolution: Updated attribution to "Tennie, Call, and Tomasello (2009)" and added proper citation. Also corrected the 2010 citation to include Herrmann.

### Counterarguments Considered
No new counterarguments needed consideration. Previous review adequately engaged all six adversarial personas.

### Issues Not Re-Flagged (Per Previous Review Stability Notes)
The following were documented as bedrock disagreements in the first review and were NOT re-flagged:
- Eliminative materialist objection to folk categories
- Buddhist non-self analysis
- Empiricist unfalsifiability concern
- MWI defender response to branching objection

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
All strengths identified in the first review remain intact:
- Four-position framework structure
- Front-loaded opening summary
- Great ape evidence as empirical anchor
- Phenomenal vs. access consciousness distinction
- All five tenet connections in Relation to Site Perspective

### Enhancements Made
- Corrected ZLS attribution from "Tomasello" to "Tennie, Call, and Tomasello (2009)"
- Added Tennie et al. 2009 to References
- Corrected Tomasello 2010 citation to include co-author Herrmann

### Cross-links Added
None needed. Previous review added all relevant cross-links.

## Word Count

Before: 2089 words
After: 2127 words (+38 words for attribution correction)
Status: 71% of 3000-word soft threshold - ok

## Remaining Items

None. The article has reached stability. Two reviews on the same day have addressed all issues.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed twice in one day. All critical and medium issues have been addressed. The article should be considered stable and should not require further review unless:
1. New content is added
2. External sources are updated
3. Related concept pages are substantially revised

The philosophical disagreements documented in the first review's stability notes remain applicable:
- Eliminative materialist objection (bedrock disagreement)
- Buddhist non-self analysis (valid alternative, not error)
- Empiricist unfalsifiability concern (methodological debate)
- MWI branching response (bedrock metaphysical dispute)

Future reviews should NOT re-flag these as critical issues.
