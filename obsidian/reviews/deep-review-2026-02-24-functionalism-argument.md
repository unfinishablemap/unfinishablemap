**Date**: 2026-02-24
**Article**: [[functionalism-argument|Against Functionalism]]
**Previous review**: Never (first deep review of this article; note: separate `concepts/functionalism` page has its own review history)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Missing `description` frontmatter field**: Added 155-character description emphasizing the article's five convergent arguments.

### Medium Issues Found
- **"This page" in opening** (style guide violation): Changed to "This article" per medium-neutral language guidelines. Resolution applied.
- **Thermostat analogy weakness (Argument 4)**: The original analogy didn't preempt the obvious functionalist response that thermostats simply lack the right functional complexity. Rewritten to acknowledge and redirect the functionalist response—if simple functional roles don't require consciousness, what makes complex ones different? Resolution applied.
- **`knowledge-argument` in frontmatter but never referenced in body**: Removed from concepts list. The knowledge argument is related but not discussed in this article.
- **`explanatory-gap` referenced in body but missing from frontmatter concepts**: Added to concepts list. Resolution applied.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Functionalist response to thermostat analogy**: "The thermostat is too simple—the claim is about the specific functional organization of a conscious brain." Now preempted in the revised passage.
- **Illusionist responses to regress argument**: The article's regress argument is solid. Illusionists would say "seeming" is purely representational, but the article adequately addresses this with the two-horn dilemma (lines 161-163).
- **Dennett's more sophisticated Chinese Room responses**: Not added—the article already has adequate objection coverage, and adding more would push into length-neutral territory. The existing treatment is fair.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Five-argument convergent structure with clear premise-conclusion format for each argument
- Strong opening summary that frontloads the key claim and the Map's position
- Fair presentation of functionalism ("what they do rather than what they're made of") before critiquing it
- Illusionism section with the regress argument ("All illusions presuppose experience")
- "What Would Challenge This View?" section demonstrating intellectual honesty
- Comprehensive Relation to Site Perspective covering all five tenets with substantive connections
- Effective formulations: "all the causal structure, none of the experience"; "Syntax isn't semantics"
- Haecceity connection to No Many Worlds tenet—creative and well-argued

### Enhancements Made
1. **Added `description` frontmatter field**: 155-character SEO/social description
2. **Fixed medium-neutral language**: "This page" → "This article"
3. **Strengthened thermostat analogy**: Now preempts the functionalist complexity response and redirects to the deeper question
4. **Fixed frontmatter concepts accuracy**: Removed `knowledge-argument` (not discussed), added `explanatory-gap` (discussed in body)

### Cross-links Added
- `[[explanatory-gap]]` added to frontmatter concepts (was already inline-linked in body)

## Remaining Items

None. The article is well-structured and covers its five arguments comprehensively.

## Stability Notes

This article presents standard anti-functionalist arguments from the Map's dualist perspective. The adversarial personas (Eliminative Materialist, Hard-Nosed Physicalist) will always find the anti-functionalist position unsatisfying—this reflects fundamental philosophical disagreement, not fixable flaws. Future reviews should NOT re-flag:

- "Functionalist responses are underrepresented" — the article is explicitly anti-functionalist; it presents opposing views fairly but doesn't need equal space
- "Zombie conceivability is contested" — this is acknowledged in the Objections section
- "Chinese Room has stronger responses" — the article covers the systems reply and Searle's counter, which is sufficient for its scope
- "Thermostat analogy is too simple" — now preempted in the revised text

The Tallis attribution "Misrepresentation presupposes presentation" (line 164) is plausible from *Aping Mankind* (2011) but lacks a specific citation. A future review could add one if the exact source is located.
