**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Article**: [[substance-property-dualism|Substance Dualism vs Property Dualism]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-20-substance-property-dualism|2026-01-20]]

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Six adversarial personas reviewed the document. The article was comprehensively reviewed 13 days ago, and most issues identified then have been resolved.

### Critical Issues Found

None. The previous review addressed the major gaps (illusionism section, decoherence challenge, contemplative evidence, falsifiability conditions, tenet coverage).

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Unverifiable Chalmers attribution**: Line 210 claimed "Chalmers's recent inclination toward substance dualism" without clear support from cited references (Chalmers 1996, 2018). The 2018 paper is about the meta-problem, not about shifting toward substance dualism.
   - **Resolution**: Reframed to "The Map leans toward substance dualism for two reasons" - focusing on the argument rather than attributed preference, per writing style guide.

### Low Issues Found

1. **Length at 132% of soft threshold**: 3307 words against 2500 soft target for concepts/. Not critical but requires length-neutral approach.
   - **Resolution**: No additions made; single targeted fix maintains current length.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Eliminative materialist (Churchland)**: Folk-psychological categories may be mistaken. **Previously addressed** via illusionism section with regress problem.
- **Hard-nosed physicalist (Dennett)**: Qualia as heterophenomenological reports. **Adequately engaged** - illusionism section addresses strongest physicalist response.
- **Quantum skeptic (Tegmark)**: Decoherence destroys coherence too fast. **Previously addressed** via decoherence section with disputed timescales, biological quantum effects, and collapse distinction.
- **Many-worlds defender (Deutsch)**: Indexical identity argument doesn't favour substance dualism. **Philosophical disagreement**, not factual error - article presents Map's reasoning fairly.
- **Empiricist (Popper)**: Falsifiability concerns. **Previously addressed** via "What Would Challenge This View?" section.
- **Buddhist philosopher (Nagarjuna)**: Substantial self denied. **Previously addressed** via contemplative evidence section acknowledging mapping difficulties.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Clear distinction between substance and property dualism with substantive comparison
- Comprehensive pairing problem treatment with three responses
- Three strong responses to illusionism (regress, introspection survives, contemplative challenge)
- Current decoherence science with three mitigating considerations
- Whitehead section that transcends the substance/property binary
- Thorough "Relation to Site Perspective" covering all 5 tenets with substantive analysis
- Good cross-linking (18 concepts, extensive inline wikilinks)

### Enhancements Made

1. Removed unverifiable Chalmers attribution - replaced with Map's own reasoning

### Cross-links Already Present

Extensive cross-linking from previous review:
- [[illusionism]], [[decoherence]], [[introspection]], [[witness-consciousness]], [[haecceity]], [[causal-closure]], [[interactionist-dualism]], [[concepts/epiphenomenalism]], [[qualia]], [[concepts/materialism]], [[russellian-monism]], [[pairing-problem]], [[quantum-consciousness]], [[Buddhism-and-dualism]]

## Remaining Items

None. Article has reached stability.

## Stability Notes

This is the second deep review. The article is converging well:
- First review (2026-01-20) added substantial content: illusionism section, decoherence section, contemplative evidence, process philosophy, falsifiability conditions, expanded tenet coverage
- This review found only one style guide compliance issue (Chalmers attribution)

The article now comprehensively covers the substance/property distinction with:
- Fair treatment of both positions
- Engagement with major objections (illusionism, decoherence, pairing problem, combination problem)
- Multiple philosophical perspectives (Western analytic, Buddhist, process philosophy)
- Clear connection to all five Map tenets

**Convergence assessment**: Article is stable. Future reviews should find minimal issues unless new content is added or significant philosophical developments warrant updates. Philosophical disagreements from adversarial personas (MWI defenders will find indexical argument unsatisfying, eliminativists will reject folk psychology) are bedrock disagreements, not fixable flaws.
