# Deep Review: The Measurement Problem

**Date**: 2026-01-19
**File**: obsidian/concepts/measurement-problem.md
**Previous review**: Never
**Type**: Cross-review (integrating many-worlds.md arguments)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None

### Medium Issues Found
- Frauchiger-Renner theorem date was incorrect (2019 → 2018): Corrected with proper citation added to References
- MWI section was lighter than the dedicated many-worlds.md page: Enhanced with substantive engagement

### Counterarguments Considered
- Eliminative materialist objection that decoherence treatment is dismissive: Article already acknowledges what decoherence accomplishes while noting its limits
- Physicalist objection that "causal closure loophole" begs the question: Article's framing is appropriate given site tenets; the loophole argument is philosophical, not presuppositional

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent opening that front-loads the key insight (measurement problem creates logical space for consciousness)
- Clear "Causal Closure Loophole" section explaining how quantum indeterminacy permits mental causation
- Thorough treatment of Stapp's quantum Zeno framework
- Strong multi-observer coordination section addressing real challenges

### Enhancements Made
1. **Expanded MWI probability problem**: Added decision-theoretic critique (Deutsch-Wallace axioms being question-begging) and the fundamental question "If all outcomes occur, what does probability *mean*?"

2. **Strengthened consciousness-unexplained argument**: Made explicit the incompatibility between MWI and Bidirectional Interaction tenet—MWI denies consciousness any role in physics

3. **Enhanced indexical problem treatment**: Added reference to haecceity concept and explained why "self-locating uncertainty" fails when both outcomes occur

4. **Connected Occam's Razor Has Limits tenet**: Ontological extravagance point now explicitly invokes the project's tenet about parsimony being unreliable

### Cross-links Added
- [[haecceity]] - Added to concepts frontmatter and referenced in indexical problem discussion
- Enhanced links to [[tenets#^occams-limits]] and [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction]] in MWI section

## Remaining Items

None - the cross-review task is complete. The measurement-problem.md article now properly integrates the detailed MWI arguments from the many-worlds.md page while maintaining its distinct focus on the foundational quantum mechanics puzzle.
