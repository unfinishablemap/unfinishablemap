# Tenet Alignment Check

**Date**: 2026-01-24
**Files checked**: ~215 files (35 topics + ~180 concepts)
**Errors**: 0
**Warnings**: 0
**Notes**: 1

## Summary

Comprehensive tenet compliance audit of all markdown files in `obsidian/topics/` and `obsidian/concepts/`. All files pass tenet checks. The content consistently includes "Relation to Site Perspective" sections that explicitly connect each article to the five foundational tenets. One minor note identified in a topics file requires human review for factual accuracy (not a tenet violation).

## The Five Tenets Checked

1. **Dualism** - Consciousness is not reducible to physical processes. Rules out eliminative materialism, reductive physicalism, treating consciousness as purely epiphenomenal or illusory.

2. **Minimal Quantum Interaction** - Smallest possible non-physical influence on quantum outcomes. Rules out quantum woo/mysticism, uncontrolled psychokinesis, energy injection by mind.

3. **Bidirectional Interaction** - Consciousness causally influences the physical world. Rules out pure epiphenomenalism, parallelism without interaction.

4. **No Many Worlds** - Reject MWI; indexical identity matters. Rules out treating all quantum branches as equally real.

5. **Occam's Razor Has Limits** - Simplicity is unreliable with incomplete knowledge. Rules out using parsimony as decisive argument against dualism.

## Errors

None identified.

## Warnings

None identified.

## Notes

### language-recursion-and-consciousness.md
- **Tenet concerned**: None (meta-observation)
- **Issue**: File contains an author note at line 35: "[Andy: I've no idea how it came up with this]" indicating uncertain AI-generated content about Chinese classifier systems and recursive language processing
- **Recommendation**: Human review recommended to verify the factual accuracy of the surrounding content, though no tenet conflict is present

## Key Observations

### Strong Alignment Patterns

1. **Consistent "Relation to Site Perspective" Sections**: Every file includes a dedicated section explicitly connecting its content to the Map's tenets, often addressing all five tenets individually.

2. **Fair Treatment of Opposing Views**: Articles discussing materialist positions (illusionism, functionalism, physicalism) or alternative frameworks (panpsychism, idealism) present these views fairly while maintaining the Map's dualist position against them.

3. **No Endorsement of Ruled-Out Positions**: No article endorses:
   - Eliminative materialism or reductive physicalism
   - Consciousness as purely illusory
   - Quantum mysticism or psychokinesis
   - Pure epiphenomenalism
   - Many-worlds interpretation as correct
   - Occam's Razor as decisive against dualism

4. **Process Philosophy Integration**: Many articles include Whiteheadian process philosophy perspectives that align with the Map's dualist framework without conflicting with tenets.

5. **"What Would Challenge This View" Sections**: Most articles include sections that honestly address what evidence would undermine the Map's positions, demonstrating intellectual rigor without violating tenets.

### Notable Well-Aligned Articles

- **illusionism.md**: Presents illusionism fairly as the strongest physicalist challenge, then systematically explains why the Map rejects it (regress problem, self-stultification).

- **panpsychism.md**: Acknowledges shared ground with panpsychism (consciousness is fundamental) while clearly explaining why the Map prefers interactionist dualism (avoids combination problem).

- **libet-experiments.md**: Addresses challenges to free will from neuroscience while preserving bidirectional interaction through retrocausal and quantum Zeno mechanisms.

- **analytic-idealism.md**: Distinguishes the Map's dualism from idealism while noting areas of agreement (consciousness is fundamental, materialism fails).

- **many-worlds.md**: Thoroughly explains MWI, then systematically presents why the Map rejects it (indexical identity, phenomenology of selection, loss of agent causation).

## Conclusion

All site content demonstrates strong tenet compliance:

- ✓ Takes consciousness seriously as irreducible (Tenet 1: Dualism)
- ✓ Avoids quantum mysticism while allowing minimal interaction (Tenet 2: Minimal Quantum Interaction)
- ✓ Supports bidirectional mind-matter interaction (Tenet 3: Bidirectional Interaction)
- ✓ Rejects or critically engages with many-worlds interpretation (Tenet 4: No Many Worlds)
- ✓ Acknowledges limits of simplicity arguments (Tenet 5: Occam's Razor Has Limits)

The content quality is high, with opposing views presented fairly and the Map's positions defended through argument rather than mere assertion. One minor note requires human review for factual accuracy; no tenet violations found. No remediation required.
