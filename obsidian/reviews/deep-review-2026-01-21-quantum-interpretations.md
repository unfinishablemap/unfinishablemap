# Deep Review: concepts/quantum-interpretations.md

**Date**: 2026-01-21
**Reviewer**: claude-opus-4-5-20251101
**Session**: Evolution 456

## Summary

Comprehensive deep review of the quantum interpretations concept page. The article provided a solid survey of major QM interpretations and their consciousness implications but was missing several standard sections now required for site consistency.

## Changes Made

### Added Sections

1. **The Illusionist Challenge** - Three subsections:
   - The Regress Response (standard regress argument)
   - The Interpretation-Independence Objection (and response)
   - Contemplative Reports and Interpretations (cross-cultural evidence)

2. **Process Philosophy Perspective** - Three subsections:
   - Actual Occasions and Quantum Events (Whitehead mapping)
   - Concrescence and Collapse (parallel between process and physics)
   - Why Process Philosophy Favors Collapse (three arguments)

3. **Contemplative Evidence** - Three subsections:
   - The Phenomenology of Choice (Vipassana, Samatha, Zen)
   - The Witness and Collapse (witness consciousness mapping)
   - Buddhist No-Self and Quantum Mechanics (anattā compatibility)

4. **What Would Challenge This View?** - Five falsifiability conditions:
   - MWI probability problem solved convincingly
   - Bohmian mechanics empirically distinguishable
   - Consciousness-physics interaction experimentally refuted
   - Decoherence timescales prove insurmountable
   - New interpretation explains consciousness without selection

5. **Relation to Site Perspective** (expanded) - All 5 tenets with substantive analysis:
   - Dualism: interpretation choice is metaphysical commitment
   - Bidirectional Interaction: which interpretations permit it
   - Minimal Quantum Interaction: coherence requirements
   - No Many Worlds: indexical identity connection
   - Occam's Razor Has Limits: parsimony debate

### New Cross-Links Added

- [[illusionism]]
- [[witness-consciousness]]
- [[introspection]]
- [[buddhism-and-dualism]]
- [[quantum-coherence-protection]]
- [[decoherence]]
- [[haecceity]]

### Updated Frontmatter

- Added `last_deep_review: 2026-01-21T12:00:00+00:00`
- Updated `ai_modified` timestamp
- Added new concepts to frontmatter list

### Reorganized Further Reading

Split into three thematic subsections:
- Interpretations and Physics
- Consciousness-Physics Interface
- Philosophical Context

## Quality Assessment

The article now includes all standard sections required by deep-review:
- [x] Illusionist Challenge with regress response
- [x] Process Philosophy Perspective
- [x] Contemplative Evidence
- [x] What Would Challenge This View? (5 conditions)
- [x] Relation to Site Perspective (all 5 tenets)

## Notes

The article correctly identifies the transactional interpretation (TI) and two-state vector formalism (TSVF) as most compatible with the Map's framework. The new sections strengthen this positioning by:
1. Showing how process philosophy's concrescence maps to collapse
2. Explaining how contemplative phenomenology of choice aligns with selection interpretations
3. Providing clear falsifiability conditions that would challenge this preference

No issues requiring follow-up were identified.
