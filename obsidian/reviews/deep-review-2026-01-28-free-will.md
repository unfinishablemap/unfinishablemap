**Date**: 2026-01-28
**Article**: [[free-will|Free Will and Determinism]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-27-free-will|2026-01-27]]
**Cross-review context**: motor-selection.md

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article has been through six previous reviews (2026-01-13, 2026-01-15, 2026-01-20, 2026-01-23, 2026-01-27) and critical issues were resolved.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Missing empirical strengthening**: The Libet section mentioned Schurger's stochastic reinterpretation but not Sjöberg (2024), whose surgical findings provide stronger evidence that the readiness potential is irrelevant to volition.
   - **Resolution**: Added Sjöberg (2024) findings to the Neuroscientific Challenge section, along with citation in References.

### Counterarguments Considered (Adversarial Personas)

- **Eliminative Materialist**: Motor Selection section is skeletal compared to motor-selection.md's depth. *Assessment*: Appropriate—topic pages should link, not duplicate. The cross-link exists.

- **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: Article mentions neural signatures without detail. *Assessment*: Voluntary-attention and motor-selection pages provide detail; article links appropriately.

- **Quantum Skeptic**: Decoherence timescales remain unquantified. *Assessment*: Bedrock disagreement; decoherence page handles this.

- **Many-Worlds Defender**: Brief MWI dismissal. *Assessment*: Appropriate given tenet 4.

- **Empiricist**: Sjöberg (2024) strengthens empirical case—now added.

- **Buddhist Philosopher**: Agent-causation requires substantial self. *Assessment*: Noted tension; process philosophy offers partial reconciliation but full resolution exceeds scope.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

1. **Clean opening** establishing the Map's distinctive agent-causal position
2. **Comprehensive luck objection treatment** with three distinguishing criteria
3. **Phenomenology integration** throughout
4. **Three-level agency structure** (select, refrain, meta-choose)
5. **Neural signatures evidence** linking phenomenology to brain function
6. **Motor Selection section** establishing the unified mechanism argument
7. **Mysterian acknowledgment** at closing—intellectual honesty about limits

### Enhancements Made

1. **Sjöberg (2024) integration**: Added surgical evidence that SMA resection (RP-generating region) doesn't impair voluntary action sense—directly strengthening the Libet rebuttal
2. **Citation added**: Sjöberg reference in References section

### Cross-links Verified
- [[motor-selection]] properly linked
- All prior cross-links preserved

## Word Count
- Before: 2119 words
- After: 2181 words
- Change: +62 words (3% increase)
- Status: Well below 3000-word soft threshold

## Remaining Items
None. The enhancement was integrative (connecting motor-selection insights) rather than corrective.

## Stability Notes

This article has reached high stability after seven reviews. Today's cross-review added one empirical strengthening (Sjöberg 2024) but found no structural or argumentative issues.

**Bedrock disagreements that should NOT be re-flagged in future reviews:**

1. **Eliminativist/physicalist objections**: The Map's dualism tenet commits to consciousness being irreducible. Critics who reject this will find the article unsatisfying regardless of refinements.

2. **MWI defender objections**: Tenet 4 rejects Many-Worlds. The phenomenology-of-choice argument won't convince committed Everettians.

3. **Buddhist no-self tension**: Agent causation requires substance dualism; Buddhist analysis denies substantial self. Process philosophy offers partial reconciliation.

4. **Quantum skepticism about neural coherence**: The Map acknowledges mechanism uncertainty while pointing to evidence.

5. **Motor selection depth**: The Motor Selection section appropriately summarizes and links rather than duplicating motor-selection.md content.

These represent the intellectual terrain the Map occupies, not flaws to fix. Future reviews should focus on new content integration rather than re-litigating these positions.
