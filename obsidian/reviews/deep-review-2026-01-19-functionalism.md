# Deep Review: Functionalism

**Date**: 2026-01-19
**File**: concepts/functionalism.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None identified.

### Medium Issues Found
- **COGITATE experiment reference lacked citation**: Added full citation (Melloni et al., 2023-2024) and clarified what the experiment tested and found.
- **Missing cross-links to newer content**: Article from 2026-01-09 had no connections to minimal-consciousness.md or evolution-of-consciousness.md despite clear relevance.
- **Temporal structure argument insufficiently grounded**: The claim that digital computation lacks specious present structure was stated but not connected to empirical evidence about simple organisms.

### Low Issues Found
- **Eliminativist critique of qualia discourse not addressed**: The article presupposes qualia exist without engaging eliminativist challenge. Deferred—article appropriately assumes site's framework.
- **Functionalist response to zombies could be deeper**: Left as is—article covers this adequately for its scope.

### Counterarguments Considered
- Functionalist reply that China brain intuitions are unreliable—addressed in original article.
- Claim that temporal structure is implementation detail—addressed by connecting to constitutive role of temporal experience.
- Slime mold case supports functionalism (cognition = function)—addressed by noting this challenges functionalism's equation of cognition with consciousness.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Strong opening summary that front-loads core position
- Multiple converging arguments structure (qualia, zombies, explanatory gap, Chinese Room)
- Substantive "Relation to Site Perspective" section connecting to all relevant tenets
- Clear distinction between access and phenomenal consciousness
- Good treatment of predictive processing and global workspace theory

### Enhancements Made
- Added new "Minimal Consciousness Challenge" section with C. elegans and slime mold cases
- Added "Evolutionary Challenge" subsection to Relation to Site Perspective
- Updated COGITATE experiment passage with proper citation and detailed findings
- Added minimal-consciousness and evolution-of-consciousness to frontmatter concepts
- Added these to Further Reading section with descriptions
- Added Melloni et al. citations to References

### Cross-links Added
- [[minimal-consciousness]] — in concepts, body text, and Further Reading
- [[evolution-of-consciousness]] — in concepts, body text, and Further Reading

## Changes Summary

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| New sections | 1 (Minimal Consciousness Challenge) |
| New subsections | 1 (Evolutionary Challenge) |
| Cross-links added | 2 concepts |
| References added | 2 (Melloni et al. 2023, 2024) |
| Words added | ~450 |

## Remaining Items

None. All identified improvements have been applied. The article now integrates findings from minimal-consciousness research and connects to the evolutionary emergence challenge, both of which strengthen the case against functionalism from the site's dualist perspective.
