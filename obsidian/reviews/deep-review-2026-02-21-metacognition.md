## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Broken wikilink**: `[[phenomenology-of-error-recognition]]` referenced 3 times (frontmatter concepts, body text, Further Reading) but the target file does not exist. → Removed wikilink from all locations; Schulz citation now inline with parenthetical reference.
- **Missing tACS citation**: "A 2025 study" referenced without authors or full citation in References section. → Added Kapetaniou et al. (2025) attribution in body text and full citation in References.

### Low Issues Found
None.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative Materialist**: Claims "consciousness" is just an umbrella for metacognitive processes. Already addressed via dissociation evidence throughout the article.
- **Dennettian heterophenomenology**: Blindsight could be described as differential responding without phenomenology. Already addressed — the article's dissociation argument doesn't require resolving this debate.
- **HOT theorist response**: Already addressed in previous reviews via double dissociation.
- **Illusionist objection**: Already addressed in previous reviews via the regress argument.
- **MWI objection**: Bedrock disagreement, noted in previous review. Not re-flagged.

## Attribution Accuracy Check

- **Maniscalco & Lau (2012)**: Correctly characterized as raising the metacognitive access question for blindsight. ✓
- **Whiten (2015)**: Correctly attributed for the Jourdain Hypothesis framing. ✓
- **Fox et al. (2012)**: Correctly cited for meditation-introspection relationship. ✓
- **Read (2008)**: Correctly attributed for great ape working memory limits. ✓
- **Cowan (2001)**: Correctly cited for human working memory capacity. ✓
- **Schulz (2010)**: Correctly quoted and attributed. ✓
- **Kapetaniou et al. (2025)**: Now properly cited (was previously unattributed). ✓

No misattributions, dropped qualifiers, source/Map conflation, or self-contradictions found.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Outstanding front-loaded opening paragraph stating the core distinction and its implications
- Double dissociation evidence (blindsight/blind insight) is the article's strongest empirical foundation
- Three-level hierarchy of representation (first-order → second-order → metarepresentation proper) is clear and pedagogically effective
- Jourdain Hypothesis section is distinctive and well-argued — a unique contribution
- Illusionist challenge section with the quasi-phenomenal regress is philosophically sharp
- Five specific falsifiers in "What Would Challenge This View?" — rare intellectual honesty
- Comprehensive cross-linking (28 concept links after fix)
- Error-blindness section with Schulz is a memorable and effective argument
- All five tenets addressed in Relation to Site Perspective with substantive engagement

### Enhancements Made
1. Replaced broken `[[phenomenology-of-error-recognition]]` wikilink with inline Schulz (2010) citation
2. Added proper attribution: "Kapetaniou et al. (2025)" replacing anonymous "A 2025 study"
3. Added full citation to References: Kapetaniou, G.E., et al. (2025). *Human Brain Mapping*, 46(2), e70146.
4. Removed non-existent concept from frontmatter concepts list

### Cross-links Added
None needed — existing cross-links are comprehensive.

## Remaining Items

None. Article has stabilized well across three reviews. Changes in this review were minor citation fixes.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed three times and has clearly converged:
- First review (2026-01-20): Addressed major structural issues
- Second review (2026-02-03): Minor refinements (quantum hedging, missing Schulz reference)
- This review (2026-02-21): Citation attribution fixes only (broken wikilink, unattributed study)

The article is at 2,917 words (117% of 2,500 soft threshold). Future reviews should consider whether condensation is warranted, but the content density is high and there is no obvious redundancy to cut.

Bedrock disagreements from previous reviews remain unchanged:
- MWI proponents will always find the indexical argument unsatisfying
- HOT theorists will resist the "tool not constitution" framing
- Eliminativists will reject the consciousness/metacognition distinction as question-begging

These are philosophical standoffs, not fixable flaws. Future reviews should NOT re-flag them as critical.
