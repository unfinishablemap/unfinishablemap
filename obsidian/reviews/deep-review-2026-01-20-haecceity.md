**Date**: 2026-01-20
**Article**: [[haecceity|Haecceity and Indexical Identity]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **No illusionism engagement**: The article argued for haecceity about conscious subjects without addressing the illusionist challenge that phenomenal consciousness itself may be illusory. **Resolution**: Added "The Illusionist Challenge" subsection with regress argument (Tallis) and performative self-refutation response.

- **No falsifiability section**: Article made metaphysical claims without indicating what would challenge them. **Resolution**: Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section with five specific conditions.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Decision-theoretic MWI defenses not engaged**: Article dismissed self-locating uncertainty without addressing sophisticated decision-theoretic defenses (Wallace, Greaves). **Resolution**: Added "Decision-Theoretic Defenses" subsection with response noting that rationality constraints presuppose indexical identity.

- **Buddhist challenge not addressed**: Article assumed substantial self without engaging Buddhist critique of inherent self-existence. **Resolution**: Added "The Buddhist Challenge" subsection with response distinguishing particularity from permanence.

- **Process philosophy missing**: No engagement with Whitehead's framework for individuation. **Resolution**: Added "Process Philosophy and Haecceity" section connecting actual occasions to haecceitistic selection.

### Counterarguments Considered
- Illusionist challenge (Dennett/Frankish): Addressed with regress argument
- Buddhist emptiness critique: Addressed by distinguishing process haecceity from substance haecceity
- Decision-theoretic Born rule derivation: Addressed by noting caring presupposes indexical identity

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent opening summary with clear thesis
- Strong connection to zombie argument and site tenets
- Clear treatment of teleportation/uploading scenarios
- Good engagement with pairing problem literature
- Solid academic references (Adams, Bailey et al., Black, Lewis, Parfit, Scotus)

### Enhancements Made
- Added illusionist engagement with response
- Added Buddhist engagement with refined haecceitism interpretation
- Added decision-theoretic MWI defense engagement
- Added process philosophy perspective (Whitehead)
- Added falsifiability section with five specific challenges
- Expanded references (Greaves, Tallis, Wallace, Whitehead)
