**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Article**: [[phenomenology-of-the-edge|The Phenomenology of the Edge]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-03-phenomenology-of-the-edge|2026-02-03]]
**Context**: Cross-review considering probability-intuition-void insights

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. Article remains stable after two previous reviews.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Probability-intuition-void not cross-referenced**: The newly created probability-intuition-void article has a parallel "Phenomenology at the Edge" section describing approach to a different cognitive limit (probability blindness). This wasn't linked because the article didn't exist at previous review. **Resolution**: Added probability-intuition-void to related_articles, integrated probability-boundary into "Multiple edges" insight, added to Further Reading section.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist objection**: Edge-clarity could be low-noise brain modes, not contact with reality. Noted as bedrock disagreement; article already has specificity/consistency rebuttal.
- **Heterophenomenology objection**: Zero-person perspective reports are verbal behavior. Noted in previous review; addressed in witness-consciousness article.
- **Empiricist falsifiability concern**: Article could be clearer about what would disconfirm edge-phenomenology claims. Medium issue but deferred—adding falsifiability criteria would increase word count on an article already at 110% of soft threshold.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening summary front-loads key claims (truncation-resilient)
- Edge-experience profile table organizes complex material clearly
- "Dissolving insight" distinct from ordinary forgetting
- Upper/lower edge convergence insight (meditators and minimal consciousness)
- Strong tenet connections across all five tenets
- Scale-void integration from previous review

### Enhancements Made
- Added probability-intuition-void to related_articles frontmatter
- Integrated probability-boundary as fifth edge type in "Multiple edges exist" insight
- Added probability-intuition-void to Further Reading with description

### Cross-links Added
- [[probability-intuition-void]] added to related_articles
- [[probability-intuition-void]] linked inline in "Multiple edges" section
- [[probability-intuition-void]] added to Further Reading

## Remaining Items

None. Cross-review integration complete. Article now connects edge-phenomenology to probability-intuition-void as another manifestation of cognitive limits with distinct phenomenological signatures.

## Stability Notes

This is the third deep review. The article has reached high stability:
- Core phenomenological framework is solid
- Tenet connections are substantive
- Cross-linking is now comprehensive (scale-void, probability-intuition-void, and original links)
- No philosophical disagreements flagged as critical (adversarial personas' objections are bedrock disagreements, not fixable flaws)
- Word count at 110% of soft threshold (2191 words) — minimal additions only

The probability-intuition-void integration was the specific task; it's been accomplished with +20 words. Future reviews should NOT expand material unless content has been substantively modified or new voids articles require cross-linking.
