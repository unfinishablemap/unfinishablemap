**Date**: 2026-02-22

**Previous review**: Never
**Word count**: 2311 → ~2340 (+29, minor additions)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None.

### Medium Issues Found
- [Description too long (233 chars, target 150-160)]: Trimmed to 152 chars while preserving key claim
- [AI refinement log in HTML comment at end of file]: Removed — editorial metadata that shouldn't remain in published article
- [Circularity acknowledgment too glib ("a feature rather than a flaw")]: Strengthened with comparison to mutual dependence of theory and observation in empirical inquiry

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative Materialist**: Folk introspective reports about temporal flow may be unreliable data. *Response*: This is philosophical disagreement with dualism's starting point, not a flaw in the article. The article's analogy about perception/epistemology addresses this.
- **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: Prosser/Hoerl positions dismissed too quickly. *Response*: The article's engagement with these positions (added in prior refinement) is actually strong — it acknowledges their sophistication and explains precisely what the Map finds inadequate. The "cost" is clearly specified.
- **Quantum Skeptic**: Consciousness-involving collapse preferred over alternatives with thin justification. *Response*: The article correctly frames this as the Map's proposal within a framework that acknowledges alternatives. Low severity.
- **Empiricist**: No testable predictions from the pairings framework. *Response*: This is a philosophical article about structural affinities, not a scientific hypothesis. The "What Would Challenge This View" equivalent is implicitly present in the concession that pairings are affinities, not necessities.

### Unsupported Claims
None identified. All philosopher attributions verified:
- Prosser (2016) on B-theory temporal experience: Accurate
- Hoerl (2014) on feeling vs. passage: Accurate
- Broad (1923) on growing block: Accurate
- Craig as presentist dualist: Accurate
- Bergson on durée: Accurately characterized

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Strong opening summary that front-loads the key thesis
- Excellent engagement with sophisticated B-theorist positions (Prosser, Hoerl)
- Honest circularity acknowledgment that strengthens rather than weakens the argument
- Clear three-way comparison structure (eternalism/presentism/growing block)
- Named resisters (Craig, B-theorist dualists) showing the pairings are affinities, not necessities
- Substantive five-tenet connection in "Relation to Site Perspective"

### Enhancements Made
- Shortened description to within style guide target
- Removed stale AI refinement log
- Strengthened circularity acknowledgment with epistemological analogy

### Cross-links Added (Primary Focus — Orphan Integration)
Added `[[temporal-ontology-and-consciousness]]` to both `related_articles` frontmatter and Further Reading sections of:
- [[growing-block-universe-and-consciousness]]
- [[temporal-structure-of-consciousness]]
- [[consciousness-and-temporal-asymmetry]]
- [[time-collapse-and-agency]]
- [[bergson-and-duration]]
- [[philosophy-of-time]] (concept)

Article went from 0 inbound links to 6 inbound links across both topics and concepts.

## Remaining Items

None. The article is well-constructed and has now been integrated into the site's link network.

## Stability Notes

This is the first deep review of this article. The key philosophical tensions are expected bedrock disagreements:
- Eliminative materialists will always challenge the reliability of temporal phenomenology as evidence — this is a foundational disagreement with dualism, not a fixable flaw
- The coherence/circularity of the growing-block/dualism mutual support is explicitly acknowledged and defended — future reviews should not re-flag this
- B-theorists will find the dismissal of their position on temporal passage unsatisfying — the article now engages their strongest versions (Prosser, Hoerl) and explains the residual cost clearly
