**Date**: 2026-01-26
**Article**: [[dopamine-selection-interface|Dopamine and the Selection Interface]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article is well-structured with proper frontmatter, accurate citations, and complete "Relation to Site Perspective" section covering all five tenets.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Neural determinism alternative not addressed**: The article assumes consciousness selects without directly engaging the alternative that stochastic neural dynamics could perform the same function. **Resolution**: Added a paragraph in the Selection Framework Application section addressing why consciousness rather than noise, citing phenomenology of effort, neural signatures, and the meaning/randomness distinction.
- **Quantum mechanism underdeveloped**: The connection between dopamine signaling timescales and quantum coherence timescales is not explicitly established. **Deferred**: This is adequately covered in the linked [[attention-motor-quantum-interface]] article; adding here would duplicate.
- **MWI response thin**: The No Many Worlds section doesn't fully engage the MWI defender's response. **Deferred**: The response is a bedrock philosophical disagreement about whether phenomenology under MWI is "real in each branch" versus genuinely selected. This represents a philosophical standoff, not a fixable flaw.
- **Falsifiability concerns**: The three-layer model is difficult to test empirically. **Acknowledged**: This is inherent to the mind-body problem; the Map's framework offers explanatory purchase rather than predictive precision.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Neural determinism**: Addressed with new paragraph citing effort phenomenology, willed/automatic neural signatures, and meaning vs. randomness distinction.
- **MWI challenge to wanting's significance**: Acknowledged as bedrock disagreement in the Relation to Site Perspective section.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Front-loaded opening summary anchored in 2024 Nature study
- Three-layer model: clear, memorable framework
- Wanting/liking dissociation with table and Parkinson's evidence
- Tonic/phasic distinction with selection framework implications
- Threshold model with drift-diffusion connection
- Comprehensive Relation to Site Perspective covering all five tenets
- Strong scientific citations with accurate presentation

### Enhancements Made
- Added paragraph responding to neural determinism alternative (phenomenology of effort, neural signatures, meaning vs. noise)
- Added cross-link to [[phenomenology-of-choice]] in new paragraph
- Added cross-link to [[mental-effort]] in Phenomenological Unity section
- Added cross-link to [[concepts/consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns]] in three-layer model section
- Added [[downward-causation]], [[phenomenology-of-choice]], and [[mental-effort]] to frontmatter concepts
- Added three new entries to Further Reading section

### Cross-links Added
- [[phenomenology-of-choice]]
- [[mental-effort]]
- [[concepts/consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns]]
- [[downward-causation]]

## Remaining Items

None. All addressable issues were handled in this review; remaining items (quantum mechanism detail, MWI engagement) are either covered in linked articles or represent bedrock philosophical disagreements.

## Stability Notes

- **MWI debate**: MWI proponents will find the "No Many Worlds" section unsatisfying, arguing that phenomenology is real in each branch. This is a bedrock philosophical disagreement about whether indexical identity matters, not a flaw to fix in future reviews.
- **Neural determinism**: The article now addresses this objection; future reviews should not re-flag unless new content undermines the response.
- **Quantum mechanism specificity**: The article appropriately defers detailed quantum mechanism discussion to [[attention-motor-quantum-interface]]; this is intentional division of labor, not incompleteness.
