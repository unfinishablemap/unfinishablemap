## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None.

### Medium Issues Found

- **Knowledge argument presented without physicalist contestation**: The knowledge argument was deployed as if conclusive without noting that physicalists have robust responses (ability hypothesis). **Resolution**: Added brief acknowledgment that physicalists contest the conclusion, while maintaining the Map's position.
- **Bird extrapolation unmarked**: The extension of Bird's dispositional essentialism (about physical laws) to psychophysical laws was presented as if it were Bird's own argument. **Resolution**: Rewrote to explicitly mark the extension to psychophysical laws as the Map's extrapolation from Bird's framework.
- **Pain-asymbolia interpretation overstated**: The article presented one interpretation of pain-asymbolia as what the condition "demonstrates," when the empirical phenomenon is neutral between frameworks. **Resolution**: Reframed as "consistent with" the powerful-qualities framework rather than proof of it.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Eliminative materialist**: Rejects the premise that phenomenal character is a settled datum. Article appropriately uses "seems" language but builds the dilemma on this premise. Acknowledged as a philosophical disagreement, not a fixable flaw.
- **Dennett (ability hypothesis)**: Mary learns a new ability, not a new fact. Added brief acknowledgment in text.
- **Quantum skeptic (decoherence)**: Consciousness biasing quantum outcomes presupposes quantum coherence in warm biological systems. This is handled in other Map articles; not addressed here to avoid scope creep.
- **Buddhist (no-self)**: Article assumes a substantial unified subject. This is a deep philosophical disagreement beyond the article's scope.

### Unsupported Claims

None that rise to high priority. All factual claims about Bird, Martin, Heil, Shoemaker, and Lewis are accurate attributions to cited works.

## Attribution Accuracy Check

- **Misattribution**: None found. All philosopher positions accurately attributed.
- **Qualifier preservation**: Bird extrapolation now explicitly marked as the Map's extension.
- **Position strength**: No overstated positions. Article uses "the Map argues" and "the Map finds" appropriately.
- **Source/Map separation**: Generally clean. Bird extrapolation was the one borderline case, now fixed.
- **Self-contradiction**: None detected.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- The three-position taxonomy (pandispositionalism, categoricalism, identity theory) — clear, well-structured, philosophically accurate
- The pandispositionalist dilemma — cleanly forces a choice between functionalism and abandoning the metaphysical thesis
- The "Dispositional Modality Problem" section — the article's most original contribution, distinguishing outward-pointing physical dispositions from bidirectional phenomenal dispositions
- The closing "central insight" paragraph — memorable formulation that the mind-body problem is about what properties are
- The pain-asymbolia example as empirical grounding (reframed but preserved)

### Enhancements Made

- Added [[explanatory-gap]] cross-link in the pandispositionalism section, connecting the dispositional dilemma to the broader explanatory gap literature
- Added [[free-will]] cross-link in Further Reading, connecting dispositional powers of consciousness to libertarian agency
- Added brief physicalist contestation of knowledge argument to strengthen intellectual honesty
- Clarified Bird extrapolation to psychophysical laws as the Map's own move

### Cross-links Added

- [[explanatory-gap]] — in pandispositionalism dilemma
- [[free-will]] — in Further Reading and related_articles

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues were addressed in this review.

## Stability Notes

- The eliminative materialist and Buddhist critiques represent bedrock philosophical disagreements with the Map's dualist framework. Future reviews should not re-flag "the article assumes qualia are real" or "the article assumes a unified subject" as issues — these are foundational commitments.
- The quantum skeptic's decoherence objection is handled in other Map articles (consciousness-and-causal-powers, brain-interface-boundary). This article's scope is dispositional ontology, not quantum mechanics implementation details.
- Pain-asymbolia's interpretation as supporting the powerful-qualities framework is philosophically reasonable but not conclusive. The current "consistent with" framing is appropriate and should not be strengthened to "demonstrates" or weakened to "merely anecdotal."
