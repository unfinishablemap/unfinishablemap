**Date**: 2026-02-03

**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-27-presentiment-and-retrocausality|2026-01-27]]

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article was reviewed on 2026-01-27 and addressed all issues at that time. No new critical issues identified.

### Medium Issues Found
None new. Previous review's medium issues (asymmetry justification, operationalization of "consciousness selects") remain addressed.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative Materialist**: The article correctly acknowledges the distinction between conscious causation (the Map's claim) and unconscious physiological responses (presentiment claims)
- **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: The mechanism gap argument (quantum-level neural selection vs. macroscopic physiological responses) adequately addresses Dennett-style concerns
- **Quantum Skeptic**: The article already disclaims the Map's reliance on presentiment, grounding retrocausality in Wheeler's experiments and transactional interpretation instead
- **MWI Defender**: Article reflects Map's rejection of MWI (tenet 4); this is a bedrock disagreement, not a content flaw
- **Empiricist**: Both sides of the presentiment debate are fairly presented with citations to primary sources
- **Buddhist Philosopher**: The distinction between conscious selection and automatic organismic response is coherent with Buddhist concepts of volition vs. reactivity

## Attribution Accuracy Check

All attributions verified:
- Bem (2011) "Feeling the Future" correctly described
- Mossbridge et al. (2012) meta-analysis figures accurate
- Duggan & Tressoldi (2018) update accurately summarized
- Galak et al. (2012) replication failures correctly reported
- Wagenmakers et al. (2011) Bayesian reanalysis fairly presented
- Wheeler delayed-choice experiments correctly cited
- Cramer transactional interpretation properly attributed

No dropped qualifiers, source/Map conflation, or misattributions detected.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
1. Clear two-claims structure distinguishing physics-based retrocausality from presentiment
2. Fair treatment of contested empirical literature (both meta-analyses and skeptical critiques)
3. The mechanism gap argument (neural quantum selection vs. macroscopic physiological anticipation)
4. Explicit statement that Map's commitments don't depend on presentiment
5. Strong connection to tenets via Bidirectional Interaction and Occam's Limits sections
6. Comprehensive references with primary sources

### Enhancements Made
No content changes to the article itself (already well-optimized at 1483 words, 49% of threshold).

## Word Count
- Before: 1483 words
- After: 1483 words (no changes to article content)
- Change: 0 words

## Remaining Items
None. The article is stable and well-integrated into the site navigation.

## Stability Notes

This article has reached stability:

1. **Physics vs parapsychology distinction**: The core claim—that the Map's retrocausality commitments rest on physics (Wheeler, Cramer, time-symmetric QM) not contested parapsychology (presentiment)—is clearly stated and won't need revision unless new physics emerges.

2. **Fair presentation of presentiment literature**: The article presents both meta-analytic support and skeptical critiques without taking a strong position on whether presentiment is real. This balance is appropriate—future reviews shouldn't push toward either direction.

3. **Mechanism gap argument**: The distinction between neural quantum selection (plausible interface with measurement) and macroscopic physiological anticipation (qualitatively larger gap) is sound. Physicalists will disagree, but this is a bedrock disagreement, not a fixable flaw.

4. **Orphan status resolved**: The article now has 6 inbound links from related content, integrating it properly into site navigation.

This represents a SUCCESSFUL review: no critical issues, stable content, improved site integration.
