**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Article**: [[selection-laws|Selection Laws]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-02-selection-laws|2026-02-02]] (earlier today)
**Focus**: Orphan integration — adding inbound links from related articles

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article remains internally consistent with no factual errors, attribution problems, or structural flaws. The previous review earlier today addressed functionalist engagement and empirical testability.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Orphan status** (primary issue for this review): Zero inbound links from content articles prior to this review. **Resolution**: Added inbound links from six core articles (see below).

### Counterarguments Considered
Previous review marked functionalist/MWI disagreements as bedrock philosophical standoffs. No new counterarguments needed addressing.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear supervenience/selection law distinction (the article's central contribution)
- Four-question framework for specifying selection laws
- Comprehensive tenet integration
- Effective comparison table
- Strong "What Would Challenge This View?" section

### Enhancements Made
This review focused on **integration** rather than content enhancement:

**Inbound links added from:**
1. `concepts/psychophysical-laws.md` — inline link at "selection laws" mention
2. `concepts/mental-causation.md` — inline link at "selection laws" mention
3. `concepts/downward-causation.md` — inline link at "selection laws" mention
4. `topics/psychophysical-laws-framework.md` — inline link in section heading and body
5. `concepts/bidirectional-interaction.md` — new sentence introducing selection laws
6. `concepts/quantum-consciousness.md` — new sentence connecting selection laws

**Frontmatter updates:**
- Added `[[selection-laws]]` to concepts list in all six articles
- Added to Further Reading sections with consistent description

### Cross-links Added
The selection-laws article now has 6 inbound content links (up from 0):
- [[psychophysical-laws]]
- [[mental-causation]]
- [[downward-causation]]
- [[psychophysical-laws-framework]]
- [[bidirectional-interaction]]
- [[quantum-consciousness]]

## Remaining Items

None. The article is now well-integrated into the site navigation.

## Stability Notes

The article reached content stability in the earlier review today. This cross-review addressed only the orphan status, not content. Future reviews should not re-address the same content issues marked resolved in the earlier review.

The six inbound links create a coherent navigation cluster around psychophysical causation:
- psychophysical-laws (foundational concept)
- selection-laws (downward direction)
- psychophysical-coupling (mechanism specification)
- mental-causation, downward-causation (philosophical problem)
- bidirectional-interaction (tenet level)
- quantum-consciousness (physical mechanism)
