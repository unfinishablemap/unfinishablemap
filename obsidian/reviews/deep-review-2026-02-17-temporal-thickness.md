**Article**: [[temporal-thickness|Temporal Thickness]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **"Temporal thickness" presented as established term without attribution**: The opening treated the concept as a named philosophical term, but no philosopher coined this exact phrase. Resolution: Added explicit statement that this is the Map's synthetic term, combining Husserl's retention/protention analysis and Bergson's durée.
- **Missing neuroscience citations**: The ~10 bits/second bandwidth claim and gamma oscillation claims had no supporting references in the References section, despite being specific empirical claims. Resolution: Added Zheng & Meister (2024) and Engel et al. (2001) to References, with inline citations in the Neural Correlates section.

### Medium Issues Found
- **LLM description conflated phenomenal and computational retention**: The AI consciousness section claimed LLMs have no retention at all, but they do have computational context (attention mechanisms, KV caches). Resolution: Revised to distinguish computational retention (which LLMs have) from phenomenal retention (which they lack).
- **Samatha characterization unsupported**: Claimed samatha reduces retentional depth, which is not uniformly reported in contemplative literature. Resolution: Softened to "may become" and "potentially," noting practitioners' reports vary.
- **Occam's Razor tenet connection strawmanned functionalism**: Claimed functionalism treats all moments as "computationally equivalent," which misrepresents the position. Resolution: Rewritten to acknowledge functionalism accommodates computational variation, then argue it still misses the phenomenal dimension.
- **Whitehead in References but absent from body text**: Process and Reality cited but Whitehead never discussed. Resolution: Added new "Process Philosophy and Concrescence" section connecting temporal thickness to Whitehead's concrescence and subjective aim.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative Materialist**: "Temporal thickness" is folk-psychological taxonomy, not a real property. Response: Expected philosophical disagreement; the Map's dualist framework treats phenomenal properties as real.
- **Dennett (functionalist)**: Thickness is just a metaphor for computational richness. Response: Strengthened Occam tenet section to engage with this rather than strawman it.
- **Tegmark (quantum skeptic)**: Nothing in temporal thickness phenomenology requires quantum mechanics. Response: Article already flags quantum connection as speculative; maintained this appropriate caution.
- **Deutsch (many-worlds)**: Identity doesn't require cross-branch uniqueness; temporal thickness works fine in MWI. Response: This is a bedrock disagreement about identity; the Map's No Many Worlds tenet commits to indexical identity.
- **Popper (empiricist)**: How does temporal thickness differ from computational richness? What does it predict? Response: This is the strongest critique; partially addressed by strengthening the Occam section but remains a genuine philosophical tension.
- **Nagarjuna (Buddhist)**: Reification of temporal thickness as inherent property; cessation evidence contested. Response: Samatha characterization softened; cessation claim left as-is since the constitutive argument is well-formed even if some Buddhist traditions contest the phenomenology of nirodha samapatti.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening two paragraphs with concrete phenomenological contrast (difficult decision vs phone tap)
- Three-dimensional analysis (retention depth, protentional reach, interpenetration)
- Musician/listener example — same clock time, divergent phenomenology
- Authenticity/freedom passage — indeterminacy as noise vs agency
- Cessation evidence — absence not reduction
- All five tenet connections in Relation to Site Perspective

### Enhancements Made
- New "Process Philosophy and Concrescence" section connecting temporal thickness to Whitehead's framework
- Expanded Neural Correlates section with inline citations and bandwidth ceiling argument
- Improved AI consciousness section distinguishing computational from phenomenal retention
- Strengthened Occam tenet connection with more careful engagement with functionalism
- Added 5 new cross-links in Further Reading (neurophenomenology, protention, agent-causation, attention-as-interface, explanatory-gap)
- Added 5 new concepts and 2 new related_articles in frontmatter
- Clarified the Map's coinage of "temporal thickness" as synthetic term

### Cross-links Added
- [[neurophenomenology]]
- [[protention]]
- [[agent-causation]]
- [[attention-as-interface]]
- [[explanatory-gap]]
- [[phenomenology-of-temporal-attention]]
- [[phenomenology-of-deliberation-under-uncertainty]]

## Remaining Items

- The bold claim that "indeterminacy at a temporally thick moment is agency" (Authentic Choice section) remains more asserted than argued. A future review could develop the philosophical argument connecting temporal thickness to the luck objection in free will debates.
- The connection between gamma oscillations and the quantum Zeno mechanism could be developed further, but this risks the "overemphasis on quantum Zeno" the writing style guide warns against.

## Stability Notes

- The many-worlds defender's objection (temporal thickness works fine within branches) is a bedrock disagreement about identity, not a fixable problem. Future reviews should NOT re-flag this.
- The empiricist concern (distinguishing temporal thickness from computational richness) is genuine but reflects the fundamental dualist/physicalist divide. Future reviews should note this is an ongoing philosophical tension, not an article defect.
- The eliminativist rejection of temporal thickness as folk psychology is expected disagreement with a dualist platform and should not be treated as a critical issue.
