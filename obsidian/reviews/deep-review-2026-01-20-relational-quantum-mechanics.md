# Deep Review: Relational Quantum Mechanics

**Date**: 2026-01-20
**File**: obsidian/concepts/relational-quantum-mechanics.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing Illusionist Challenge section**: Addressed by adding comprehensive section with regress response and phenomenology of observation subsections
- **Missing Process Philosophy Perspective section**: Added section covering concrescence vs. relativization, subject-superject structure, and experience all the way down
- **Missing What Would Challenge This View? section**: Added with 5 falsifiability conditions
- **Relation to Site Perspective section needed expansion**: Expanded from brief paragraphs to substantive coverage of all 5 tenets with deeper analysis
- **Style inconsistency**: Fixed lowercase "The Unfinishable Map" instances to "the Map"

### Counterarguments Considered
- Illusionist argument that RQM succeeds because consciousness is illusory → Addressed via regress response (Tallis)
- RQM's appeal to simplicity → Countered with "restriction of scope, not genuine explanation"
- Cross-perspective links solving intersubjectivity → Noted as unresolved challenge
- Whitehead's alternative framework → Added as illuminating what RQM sacrifices

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear opening explanation of RQM's core idea with good relativity analogy
- Effective use of Wigner's friend example
- Excellent comparison table format
- Fair presentation of challenges to RQM (intersubjectivity, solipsism, locality, observer boundaries)
- Direct engagement with why RQM matters even for those who reject it

### Enhancements Made
- Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section (3 subsections)
- Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section (3 subsections)
- Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section (5 conditions)
- Expanded all 5 tenet connections in "Relation to Site Perspective"
- Added haecceity connection to No Many Worlds discussion
- Added epiphenomenalism concern to Bidirectional Interaction discussion

### Cross-links Added
- [[illusionism]]
- [[introspection]]
- [[decoherence]]
- [[haecceity]]
- [[witness-consciousness]]
- [[many-worlds]]
- [[combination-problem]]
- [[epiphenomenalism]]

### References Added
- Frankish, K. (2016). Illusionism as a Theory of Consciousness
- Tallis, R. (2024). The Illusion of Illusionism
- Whitehead, A. N. (1929). Process and Reality

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues were addressed in this review.

## Summary of Changes

This deep review transformed the article from a solid introduction to RQM into a comprehensive treatment that:

1. **Engages with illusionism**: The new section addresses how illusionists might view RQM as an ally, then provides the regress response and phenomenology of observation counter-arguments.

2. **Provides process philosophy framing**: Whitehead's actual occasions framework illuminates what RQM's relativization sacrifices—genuine concrescence, the subject-superject temporal asymmetry, and experience pervading reality.

3. **Establishes falsifiability**: The "What Would Challenge This View?" section provides 5 conditions that would require revising the Map's position on RQM.

4. **Deepens tenet connections**: Each tenet now receives substantive treatment explaining not just that RQM conflicts but *why* and *how* the conflict reveals incompatible commitments.

5. **Expands cross-referencing**: 11 concept pages now linked in Further Reading (up from 5), enabling readers to explore the full network of related ideas.

The article now follows the standard deep-review template used across the Map's concept pages, ensuring consistency in how philosophical positions are presented, challenged, and connected to the Map's tenets.
