**Date**: 2026-01-29
**Article**: [[delegatory-dualism|Delegatory Dualism]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article was well-structured with all required sections, accurate claims properly attributed to Saad, and appropriate tenet connections.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Epiphenomenalism dismissal too quick**: The article called epiphenomenalism "self-undermining" without engaging the illusionist counter-response that self-models could generate reports without phenomenal causation.
   - **Resolution**: Added engagement with illusionism, noting it trades the hard problem for an equally hard "illusion problem."

2. **MWI dependency implicit**: The framework depends on collapse-based quantum mechanics but didn't explicitly note this dependency.
   - **Resolution**: Added new objection/response section on MWI dependency, plus connection to No Many-Worlds tenet in Relation to Site Perspective.

3. **No testability discussion**: The empiricist objection that theories must be falsifiable was unaddressed.
   - **Resolution**: Added "Testability" subsection under "What Delegation Explains" outlining empirical predictions and methodological challenges.

### Low Issues Addressed
- Relationship between delegatory dualism and quantum mechanics now clarified (compatible but operates at different level; MWI rejection required)
- Added links to [[illusionism]] and [[many-worlds]] in concepts and Further Reading

### Counterarguments Considered
1. **Illusionist response**: Self-models generate reports without phenomenal causation
   - **How addressed**: Noted that representing oneself as conscious presupposes phenomenal experience ("illusion problem")

2. **MWI objection**: If all outcomes occur, nothing to delegate
   - **How addressed**: New objection/response acknowledging the dependency and connecting to Map's MWI rejection

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- The military analogy (major/sergeant preemption) — memorable and clarifying
- The five constraints framework — clear organizational structure
- The observational vs. universal closure distinction — important contribution
- The substantive Relation to Site Perspective section — connects to multiple tenets

### Enhancements Made
1. Added engagement with illusionism when discussing epiphenomenalism
2. Added new objection/response on MWI dependency
3. Added No Many-Worlds tenet connection in Relation to Site Perspective
4. Added Testability subsection
5. Expanded Further Reading with [[illusionism]] and [[many-worlds]]
6. Added illusionism and many-worlds to concepts list

### Cross-links Added
- [[illusionism]]
- [[many-worlds]]

- Change: +289 words

## Remaining Items
None. All identified issues have been addressed.

## Stability Notes
The article now addresses the main philosophical objections that adversarial personas would raise. Future reviews should note:

- **MWI proponents will still disagree**: The article now explicitly acknowledges dependence on collapse-based QM. This is a bedrock commitment, not a fixable flaw.
- **Illusionists will still disagree**: The article engages their response and explains why it fails from the Map's perspective. This represents a philosophical standoff, not an oversight.
- **Mechanism question remains open**: The article correctly notes that delegatory dualism addresses causal structure, not mechanism. The Map's quantum framework addresses mechanism separately. This division of labor is by design, not a gap to fill.
