## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Missing Occam's Razor tenet** (C1): Relation to Site Perspective covered only 4 of 5 tenets. Resolution: Added substantive Occam's Razor connection arguing that reductive parsimony evades rather than explains the phenomenal data.
- **Desmurget attribution error** (C2): Described neurosurgical stimulation findings as "patients with certain neurological conditions." Resolution: Rewritten to accurately describe Desmurget et al. (2009) as intraoperative parietal cortex stimulation, with correct description of both parietal (intention without movement) and premotor (movement without awareness) results.
- **Frontal theta qualifier dropped** (C3): "Frontal theta, bidirectional coherence" presented as general agency-passivity correlates when they specifically track willed-vs-instructed attention (Bengson 2019). Resolution: Rewritten to narrow the claim and properly attribute the evidence scope.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Anti-epiphenomenalism begs question** (M1): Original assumed epiphenomenalism cannot accommodate phenomenal distinctions. Resolution: Revised to acknowledge the epiphenomenalist can accept the contrast exists while denying it tracks causal differences, then argued against this via the calibration problem.
- **Contemplative evidence unsupported** (M2): No citation for claim that contemplative training sharpens the distinction. Resolution: Added Lutz et al. (2008) citation and cross-link to meditation-and-consciousness-modes. Also improved the anti-illusionism argument to address what illusionists actually claim.
- **Flow tension unacknowledged** (M3): Flow dissociates effort from causal contribution, undermining the article's core argument. Resolution: Added explicit acknowledgment of the tension and the Map's response (effort tracks difficulty of selection, not its presence).
- **Anarchic hand uncited** (M4): Clinical condition discussed without reference. Resolution: Added Della Sala et al. (1991) citation.
- **Dream section question-begging** (M5): "The dreamer generates the entire scenario" conflated brain and conscious self. Resolution: Rewritten to distinguish neural production from conscious experience.
- **"Confirming" overstated** (U3): Clinical dissociations described as "confirming" dualism when they're neutral between interpretations. Resolution: Changed to "suggesting" and added acknowledgment that physicalists read the same data differently, with a counter-argument about distinctive phenomenal character.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminative materialist**: Folk-psychological categories may not track natural kinds. Not directly addressed in article (would require substantial expansion); the existing tenet-connection and contemplative-evidence arguments partially cover this.
- **Physicalist (Dennett)**: Predictive processing / comparator model explains agency without non-physical causation. Not addressed; deferred as potential future expansion.
- **Quantum skeptic**: Quantum Zeno mechanism assertion is thin. The article appropriately links to mental-effort for detailed treatment rather than duplicating it.
- **MWI defender**: Branch-local phenomenology of singularity doesn't refute branching. The existing argument is acknowledged as a philosophical standoff.
- **Empiricist**: No falsifiable predictions. Acknowledged as a genuine limitation; the article makes philosophical rather than empirical claims.
- **Buddhist**: The agent may be phenomenologically elusive. Not addressed; connects to volitional-opacity void.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening paragraph: vivid concrete examples leading to theoretical stakes
- Two-pole parallel structure (four features at each pole)
- Spectrum cases (habitual action, flow, dreams, hypnosis, anarchic hand)
- "Consciousness choosing not to choose" formulation
- Choking phenomenon as evidence for mental causation
- Non-formulaic tenet connections (especially No Many Worlds)

### Enhancements Made
- Added Occam's Razor tenet connection
- Improved anti-epiphenomenalism argument (calibration problem framing)
- Strengthened anti-illusionism argument with citation and better engagement
- Added flow tension acknowledgment with Map's response
- Fixed Desmurget attribution to accurately describe neurosurgical evidence
- Added clinical citations (Della Sala 1991, Frith 1992, Lutz et al. 2008)
- Nuanced dream section to distinguish neural production from conscious agency
- Strengthened disorders section with phenomenal-character counter-argument

### Cross-links Added
- [[lucid-dreaming-and-consciousness]] (in dreams section and related_articles)
- [[conscious-vs-unconscious-processing]] (in habitual action section and concepts)
- [[choking-phenomenon-mental-causation]] (added to related_articles)
- [[meditation-and-consciousness-modes]] (in anti-illusionism argument)
- [[illusionism]] and [[concepts/epiphenomenalism]] (added to concepts)

## Remaining Items

- **Predictive processing engagement**: The article does not address the comparator/efference-copy model of agency, which provides a physicalist explanation of why actions feel different from perceptions. A future refine-draft could add a brief engagement.
- **Contemplative detail**: The anti-illusionism section mentions meditators distinguishing fine gradations but does not describe what those gradations are. A future expansion could detail specific contemplative reports.
- **Temporal structure**: The article notes agency is future-directed and passivity present-oriented but does not develop this into sustained analysis. Connects to time-collapse-and-agency.
- **Luck objection**: The quantum selection framework faces the objection that quantum indeterminacy yields randomness, not agency. The phenomenology of purposive deliberation could address this.

## Stability Notes

The six adversarial personas all disagree with the article's dualist framework, as expected. These represent bedrock philosophical disagreements, not fixable problems:
- The eliminativist denial of phenomenological evidence is a foundational disagreement with the Map's methodology
- The MWI defender's claim that branch-local singularity is compatible with branching is a genuine philosophical standoff
- The empiricist demand for falsifiable predictions applies to the entire Map framework, not just this article

Future reviews should NOT re-flag these as critical issues.
