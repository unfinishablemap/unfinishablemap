**Date**: 2026-01-21
**Article**: [[mind-brain-separation|Mind-Brain Separation and the Division of Faculties]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
1. **Missing illusionist engagement**: The article did not address the strongest physicalist challenge—Frankish's quasi-phenomenal properties. [Resolution: Added comprehensive "The Illusionist Challenge" section (~500 words) with regress problem and zombie reformulation arguments.]

2. **Missing Process Philosophy section**: Standard for deep-reviewed articles, absent here. [Resolution: Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section (~350 words) covering actual occasions, prehension, concrescence, and how Whitehead's framework illuminates the binding problem.]

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Missing "What Would Challenge This View?" section**: No falsifiability conditions stated. [Resolution: Added comprehensive section with 5 specific challenges that would undermine the framework.]

2. **Thin No Many Worlds argument**: Tenet not engaged in Relation to Site Perspective. [Resolution: Added substantial No Many Worlds subsection (~150 words) explaining how the phenomenology of choice supports genuine selection over branching.]

3. **Missing cross-links to recent articles**: phenomenology-of-choice.md and motor-selection.md not linked. [Resolution: Added cross-links in concepts frontmatter, Faculties at the Interface section, and Further Reading.]

4. **Bergson memory claim needed nuance**: Presented without acknowledging modern engram research. [Resolution: Expanded to acknowledge optogenetic findings while noting engrams appear more like retrieval keys than storage containers.]

### Counterarguments Considered
- Illusionist claim that qualia are introspective misrepresentations → Addressed via regress problem
- Many-worlds claim that selection is illusory → Addressed via phenomenology of choice
- Parsimony argument for production models → Already addressed; strengthened by noting it assumes hard problem will be solved

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Rendering engine analogy (fresh, illuminating)
- Clear division of faculties into mental, neural, and interface categories
- Dreams evidence for filter model
- Blindsight as demonstration of processing/consciousness dissociation
- Good existing treatment of James, Bergson, Huxley filter theory lineage

### Enhancements Made
1. Added phenomenology-of-choice connection to the interface section (~100 words)
2. Added illusionist challenge with detailed engagement of quasi-phenomenal properties (~500 words)
3. Added Process Philosophy section connecting to Whitehead's framework (~350 words)
4. Added No Many Worlds argument in tenet coverage (~150 words)
5. Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section with 5 specific conditions (~300 words)
6. Expanded Bergson memory claim with modern engram research nuance (~100 words)
7. Expanded Further Reading from 6 to 11 cross-links

### Cross-links Added
- [[filter-theory]] (detailed treatment)
- [[phenomenology-of-choice]] (experiential dimension of selection)
- [[motor-selection]] (motor pattern selection)
- [[illusionism]] (strongest physicalist challenge)
- [[near-death-experiences]] (enhanced experience during brain compromise)

## Remaining Items

None. All critical and medium issues addressed.

## Total Additions

Approximately 1,500 words added across:
- The Illusionist Challenge section (new)
- Process Philosophy Perspective section (new)
- What Would Challenge This View? section (new)
- No Many Worlds tenet coverage (expansion)
- Bergson memory paragraph (expansion)
- Phenomenology of choice connection (expansion)
- Further Reading (5 new cross-links)
