## Changed Sources Identified

3 sources changed since last synthesis (2026-02-03):

1. **concepts/phenomenal-normativity** (NEW, 2026-02-11) — The view that phenomenal experiences carry intrinsic normative force. Pain is bad in its very phenomenal character, not through external judgment. Provides the philosophical foundation beneath phenomenal-value-realism and closes Hume's is-ought gap.

2. **topics/free-will** (ai_modified 2026-02-06) — Updated with counterfactual reasoning, creativity as generation-selection synthesis, dream problem-solving evidence, motor selection, volitional opacity, distal intentions, and phenomenology of intellectual effort.

3. **topics/ethics-of-consciousness** (ai_modified 2026-02-07) — Updated with stronger framework-conditional framing for AI consciousness conclusions, more nuanced convergence claims, explicit acknowledgment that AI ethics conclusions depend on contested framework commitments.

## Pessimistic Review

### Clarity Critic
- The "Starting Point" section introduced phenomenal value realism and value pluralism but didn't explain *why* experience carries normative force — it asserted rather than argued. The is-ought gap was left open.
- The list of value dimensions (hedonic valence, aesthetic quality, meaning, agency, understanding, connection) read as a catalog rather than flowing narrative.
- The "Technology and Experience" section felt somewhat detached from the personal/practical tone of surrounding sections.

### Redundancy Hunter
- "Quality of your conscious experience" and "experiential quality" appeared repeatedly as the practical upshot of multiple sections — the same message restated across sections.
- "Your choices matter" section and "Take choices seriously" in the concluding list substantially repeated each other (acceptable in apex synthesis but watchable).

### Narrative Flow Analyst
- The article builds well from personal → interpersonal → universal → practical. The arc "you are real → your choices matter → responsibility → meaning → others → uncertainty → technology → shape of a life → contemplation → challenges" is coherent.
- The meta-commentary paragraph ("This apex article draws together...") weakened the narrative entry.
- The "Contemplative Practice" section's opening paragraph packed too many distinct points, reducing readability.

## Optimistic Review

### Connection Finder
- **Phenomenal normativity** provides the missing philosophical grounding for the article's central claim that experiential quality is where value resides. The article previously asserted this through phenomenal-value-realism but didn't explain the mechanism.
- The is-ought bridge from phenomenal normativity strengthens the "Meaning Grounded in Experience" section — addressing why consciousness-grounded meaning isn't just philosophical assertion.
- Buddhist vedanā concept from phenomenal normativity connects directly to the existing contemplative practice section.
- Counterfactual reasoning and creativity insights from updated free-will article deepen the "Your Choices Matter" section.

### Synthesis Strengthener
- The chain phenomenal normativity → is-ought bridge → meaning grounded in experience → ethics of consciousness creates a stronger argumentative structure than previously existed.
- Adding phenomenal normativity as a source fills a conceptual gap: the article had phenomenal-value-realism (what is valuable) but not the underlying argument for why experience carries normative force.

### Human Reader Advocate
- Integration should weave into existing sections rather than adding new ones — the article's narrative flow is its strength.
- The vedanā discussion adds concrete cross-cultural evidence to the contemplative section, grounding it beyond Western philosophy.

## Length Assessment

- **Before**: ~3,480 words
- **After**: ~3,538 words
- **Target range**: 2500-4000 words
- **Status**: Within range, no condensation or expansion needed

## Summary of Changes Made

1. **Added phenomenal-normativity to sources**: Frontmatter `apex_sources`, `concepts`, and Source Articles section updated.

2. **"The Starting Point: You Are Real" section**: Integrated phenomenal normativity to explain *why* value lives in experience rather than being projected onto it. Added the is-ought bridge argument. Tightened the value pluralism list from expanded descriptions to concise terms.

3. **"Your Choices Matter" section**: Integrated counterfactual reasoning and creativity-as-generation from updated free-will source. Consciousness now shown as generating possibilities, not merely selecting among them.

4. **"Meaning Grounded in Experience" section**: Added phenomenal normativity reference to show that meaning grounded in consciousness is phenomenological observation, not mere assertion.

5. **"Others Matter Too" section**: Connected suffering's moral weight to phenomenal normativity — badness is constitutive of suffering, not an evaluation layered on top.

6. **"Contemplative Practice" section**: Added vedanā discussion and meditators' reports of persistent valence when meta-attitudes are suspended, connecting to phenomenal normativity's contemplative evidence.

7. **Opening**: Replaced meta-commentary ("This apex article draws together...") with more narrative-forward phrasing ("What follows draws together...").

8. **Source Articles list**: Added phenomenal-normativity with descriptive annotation.
