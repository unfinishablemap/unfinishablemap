**Date**: 2026-02-24
**Article**: [[adaptive-computational-depth|Adaptive Computational Depth]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-24-adaptive-computational-depth|2026-02-24]] (earlier today)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article was thoroughly reviewed earlier today and all medium issues from that review were resolved.

### Medium Issues Found
None new. Previous review's resolutions remain sound:
- Self-allocation objection is now engaged directly
- Interpretation-dependent claims are properly qualified
- Wolfram inference is explicitly marked as Map's interpretation
- Epistemological status section is honest about unfalsifiability

### Counterarguments Considered
No new counterarguments beyond those already addressed. The six adversarial personas found no issues that weren't already handled by the first review.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening summary effectively front-loads the non-computability insight
- Source progression (Wheeler → Bostrom → Wolfram → Irwin → Penrose → Faizal) builds cumulatively
- Prebiotic question section appropriately brief with cross-reference
- Five-tenet coverage comprehensive and specific
- Epistemological status section demonstrates intellectual honesty
- "What Would Challenge This View?" section provides five concrete falsifiers
- Computational analogies (adaptive mesh refinement, LOD rendering) make the concept accessible

### Enhancements Made
Primary focus of this review was **orphan integration** — the article had zero inbound links despite strong thematic connections across the site.

### Cross-links Added (5 inbound links from existing articles)
1. **[[simulation|The Simulation Hypothesis]]** — Added inline link in the Minimal Quantum Interaction section where the article discusses the simulator not pre-calculating every quantum outcome. Natural connection: simulation efficiency = adaptive computational depth.
2. **[[the-participatory-universe|The Participatory Universe]]** — Added inline link in the "It from bit" description. Natural connection: Wheeler's participatory universe is adaptive depth avant la lettre.
3. **[[consciousness-and-the-physics-of-information|Consciousness and the Physics of Information]]** — Added inline link in the "Information as Interface" section where Wheeler's framework is discussed. Natural connection: information concentrating where observers engage.
4. **[[consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns|Consciousness-Selecting Neural Patterns]]** — Added inline link in the bandwidth constraint section after the policy-level selection explanation. Natural connection: coarse-grained selection = adaptive depth.
5. **[[prebiotic-collapse|Prebiotic Collapse]]** — Added inline link in the Map's Position section where consciousness modulation of collapse is described. Natural connection: baseline resolution everywhere with consciousness increasing depth locally.

## Remaining Items

None. The article has reached stability after two reviews in one day. The orphan integration goal has been achieved with 5 natural inbound links from highly relevant articles.

## Stability Notes

- The self-allocation objection (computationalists arguing systems can determine "what matters" without non-computational input) is a bedrock philosophical disagreement, not a fixable flaw. The article now engages with it directly.
- MWI proponents will always find the incompatibility assertion unsatisfying. This is correctly noted as a fundamental incompatibility.
- The unfalsifiability of consciousness-based quantum interpretations is a feature of the entire Map framework, not specific to this article. The Epistemological Status section acknowledges this honestly.
- The article should now be well-integrated into the site's navigation graph through 5 inbound links from core articles spanning simulation, participatory universe, physics of information, neural selection, and prebiotic collapse.
