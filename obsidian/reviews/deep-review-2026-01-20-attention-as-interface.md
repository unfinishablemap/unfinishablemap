**Article**: [[attention-as-interface|Attention As Interface]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Perspectives Applied

1. **Eliminative Materialist** (Churchland): Article assumed causal efficacy without engaging how non-physical consciousness interfaces with attention mechanisms
2. **Hard-Nosed Physicalist** (Dennett): Missing engagement with illusionism and attention schema theory
3. **Quantum Skeptic** (Tegmark): Decoherence objections not addressed; some research citations incomplete
4. **Many-Worlds Defender** (Deutsch): MWI rejection asserted but not fully argued
5. **Empiricist** (Popper): Several citations needed verification/completion
6. **Buddhist Philosopher** (Nagarjuna): Unified selector assumption not examined

### Critical Issues Found
- No engagement with illusionism/attention schema theory: **Resolved** - Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section with regress argument
- Missing decoherence engagement: **Resolved** - Added falsification condition #3 and cross-link to decoherence article

### Medium Issues Found
- MWI rejection not fully argued: **Resolved** - Expanded "No Many Worlds" tenet section with self-locating uncertainty critique
- Incomplete citations: **Resolved** - Updated References section with complete citations
- Missing process philosophy perspective: **Resolved** - Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section

### Counterarguments Considered
- Illusionism claims attention schema *is* consciousness → Addressed via regress argument
- Predictive processing explains attention computationally → Added as falsification condition
- Contemplative evidence suggests no-self dissolves selector → Added as falsification condition #6

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Excellent hypothesis statement in opening paragraphs
- Clear table structure for core claims
- Strong integration of FA/OM meditation distinction
- Thoughtful treatment of candidate selection sites
- Comprehensive "Other Candidate Interfaces" section examining emotion/volition/imagination

### Enhancements Made
1. Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section engaging Dennett/Frankish with regress argument
2. Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section with Whitehead's actual occasions and prehension
3. Added "The Mysterian Alternative" section on cognitive closure
4. Added comprehensive "What Would Challenge This View?" section with 7 falsification conditions
5. Expanded "No Many Worlds" tenet connection with explicit argument against self-locating uncertainty
6. Updated Further Reading with organized subsections (Core Interface Concepts, Quantum Mechanisms, Related Cognitive Domains, Alternative Perspectives)
7. Expanded References with complete citations (12 entries)

### Cross-links Added
- [[illusionism]]
- [[mysterianism]]
- [[decoherence]]
- [[haecceity]]
- [[concepts/many-worlds]]
- [[introspection]]
