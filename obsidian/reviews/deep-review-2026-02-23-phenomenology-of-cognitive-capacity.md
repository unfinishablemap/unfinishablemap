## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Rouder et al. (2008) misattribution**: The claim that "participants reliably predict when they are approaching capacity before performance degrades" does not match the paper's actual content. Rouder et al. 2008 tests fixed-capacity (slot) vs. variable-resource models of visual working memory. It supports discrete capacity limits (~4 items) but does not test metacognitive predictions of approaching capacity. **Resolution**: Rewritten to attribute only the discrete capacity-limit finding to Rouder, with the phenomenological claim of felt approach as a general observation.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Computational straw man (line 66)**: Original text claimed "a computational system that drops data simply lacks it" — this ignores that modern systems have error-detection and metadata about failures. **Resolution**: Rewritten to acknowledge computational error-flagging while arguing the phenomenal character (felt, involuntary, specific) remains distinct.
- **Ericsson et al. (1993) overextension**: Described as showing "different neural outcomes" when the paper is about performance and skill-development outcomes, not neural outcomes specifically. **Resolution**: Changed to "qualitatively different skill development."
- **No Many Worlds tenet connection**: Original argument that "cognitive overflow presupposes genuine loss" doesn't distinguish collapse from MWI — each MWI branch-self experiences genuine loss too. **Resolution**: Reframed around the phenomenology of *effort* — under MWI all combinations are realised regardless of effort, making the felt pressure of maintenance an illusion of efficacy.
- **Five dangling references**: Dreyfus (2002), Fitts & Posner (1967), Kahneman (1973), Sweller (1988), and Shklovsky (1917) were in References but never cited. **Resolution**: Integrated first four where they add value; removed Shklovsky as tangential.
- **Description too long**: ~242 characters vs. 150-160 guideline. **Resolution**: Trimmed to ~155 characters.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Churchland (eliminative materialist)**: Phenomenological reports may be unreliable guides to cognitive architecture. The article's "What Would Challenge This View" section partially addresses this by noting the felt-capacity/actual-capacity correlation.
- **Dennett (physicalist)**: Meta-representations about performance could constitute the experience. Addressed by strengthening the argument that error codes are not phenomenal character.
- **Deutsch (MWI defender)**: Branch-selves experience genuine loss. Addressed by reframing around effort rather than outcome.
- **Nagarjuna (Buddhist)**: Consciousness is reified as a container. Not addressed — this is a philosophical perspective difference within the article's chosen framework.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Phenomenological descriptions ("Texture of Saturation," "Texture of Withdrawal") — vivid, specific, philosophically substantive
- The "shaped absence" observation — original contribution on knowing the form of what was lost
- Graded progression from comfort through vigilance to overflow — well-structured experiential account
- "What Would Challenge This View" section — honest, well-crafted falsification conditions
- Mirror-image structure (overload as ceiling, automatisation as withdrawal) — strong organizing principle
- Strong, front-loaded opening paragraph

### Enhancements Made
- Integrated Fitts & Posner (1967) three-stage model into automatisation discussion, noting phenomenological dimensions their stage model misses
- Integrated Kahneman (1973) attention-as-effort framework into maintenance discussion, connecting to the phenomenology of basic holding effort
- Integrated Dreyfus (2002) on skilled coping without representations, contrasting with the Map's claim of residual phenomenal character
- Integrated Sweller (1988) cognitive load theory as contrast — systematises performance consequences but misses phenomenal character
- Expanded thin Embodiment section with automatisation-side examples (bodily relief of automatised skills)
- Strengthened computational argument against reduction to error-detection

### Cross-links Added
- No new cross-links added — existing cross-link coverage is comprehensive (13 Further Reading items, all verified to exist)

## Remaining Items

None. All critical and medium issues were addressed in this review.

## Stability Notes

- The **eliminative materialist objection** (phenomenology as unreliable self-report) is a bedrock philosophical disagreement. The article's framework assumes phenomenological access is informative; eliminativists deny this. Future reviews should not re-flag this.
- The **Buddhist objection** (reifying consciousness as a container) represents a fundamental framework difference. The article works within a dualist framework where consciousness has properties; process-philosophy alternatives are legitimate but represent a different starting point, not a flaw.
- The **No Many Worlds connection** is inherently the weakest tenet connection for this topic. The revised version (effort as efficacious vs. illusory) is stronger than the original (genuine loss) but MWI proponents will always have responses. This is a philosophical standoff, not a fixable problem.
