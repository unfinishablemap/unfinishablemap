# Deep Review: Indexical Facts

**Date**: 2026-01-28
**File**: obsidian/concepts/indexical-facts.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Applied six adversarial philosopher personas: Eliminative Materialist (Churchland), Hard-Nosed Physicalist (Dennett), Quantum Skeptic (Tegmark), Many-Worlds Defender (Deutsch), Empiricist (Popper), Buddhist Philosopher (Nagarjuna).

### Critical Issues Found

None. The article had no factual errors, internal contradictions, or missing required sections.

### Medium Issues Found

1. **Epistemic/ontological distinction not addressed**: Physicalist objection that indexical facts are knowledge gaps, not additional facts, was not engaged with.
   - **Resolution**: Added new subsection "The Epistemic Objection" responding directly to this challenge.

2. **Friederich and Dawid citation incomplete**: Referenced without full publication details.
   - **Resolution**: Added complete citation: Friederich & Dawid (2022), BJPS 73(3):711-721.

3. **No engagement with no-self views**: Buddhist/Parfitian view that "I" might be illusory was not considered.
   - **Resolution**: Added paragraph in Personal Identity section acknowledging and responding to this objection.

4. **List citation incorrect year**: Cited as 2025, actually published 2022.
   - **Resolution**: Corrected to List (2022), Noûs 57(2):316-340.

5. **MWI self-locating uncertainty response thin**: The article noted objections to self-locating uncertainty but didn't explain them adequately.
   - **Resolution**: Expanded to explain Friederich & Dawid's critique of the Sebens-Carroll approach and clarify why the uncertainty is spurious.

### Counterarguments Considered

1. **Indexical facts as epistemic, not ontological** (Dennett-style): Directly addressed in new "Epistemic Objection" subsection.

2. **MWI can accommodate self-locating uncertainty**: Strengthened the response—uncertainty requires a fact to be uncertain about, which MWI denies.

3. **The "I" might not exist (Buddhist/Parfit)**: Acknowledged and responded to—even if the self is constructed, there remains an indexical element about which construction is happening here.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

Applied six sympathetic philosopher personas: Property Dualist (Chalmers), Quantum Mind Theorist (Stapp), Phenomenologist (Nagel), Process Philosopher (Whitehead), Libertarian Free Will Defender (Kane), Mysterian (McGinn).

### Strengths Preserved

- Excellent front-loaded opening summary stating core concept and significance
- Perry's sugar-bag example and Lewis's Two Gods scenario—clear, effective illustrations
- Strong connection to qualia, phenomenal consciousness, and vertiginous question
- Phenomenological language about embodiment ("your body is *here*—at the centre of your experiential field")
- Substantive "Relation to Site Perspective" section with genuine tenet connections
- Self-contained: defines terms in context, comprehensible without following links
- Clear structure building from concrete examples to philosophical implications

### Enhancements Made

1. Added "The Epistemic Objection" subsection responding to the physicalist challenge
2. Added paragraph on Buddhist/Parfitian no-self views with response
3. Expanded MWI section with clearer explanation of why self-locating uncertainty fails
4. Corrected List citation (2022, not 2025)
5. Added complete Friederich & Dawid citation

### Cross-links Added

None new—existing cross-links ([[vertiginous-question]], [[haecceity]], [[qualia]], [[many-worlds]], etc.) are comprehensive.

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues were addressed.

## Word Count

- Before: 1696 words (68% of 2500 soft threshold)
- After: 2105 words (84% of 2500 soft threshold)
- Change: +409 words

## Stability Notes

- The pessimistic personas raised philosophical disagreements (eliminativists deny indexical facts are ontological, MWI defenders find the critique circular, Buddhists question the self) but these are **bedrock disagreements** between the Map's dualist perspective and opposing views—not flaws to fix.
- The article now directly engages with the strongest objections rather than leaving them implicit.
- Future reviews should not re-flag "physicalists disagree that indexical facts are ontological" or "MWI proponents think self-locating uncertainty works"—these are acknowledged philosophical standoffs documented in the article itself.
