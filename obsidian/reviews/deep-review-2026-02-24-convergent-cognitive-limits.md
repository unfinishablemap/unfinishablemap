**Date**: 2026-02-24
**Article**: [[convergent-cognitive-limits|Convergent Cognitive Limits]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-30-convergent-cognitive-limits|2026-01-30]]

## Review Context

Cross-review triggered by the new [[adaptive-cognitive-limits|Adaptive Cognitive Limits]] article. The adaptive limits framework introduces a distinction between architectural limits (inherent to cognitive structure) and adaptive limits (maintained by natural selection for fitness advantage). This distinction has direct implications for how convergent limits should be interpreted.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The previous review's fixes hold up well. No new critical issues identified.

### Medium Issues Found

- **Missing adaptive/architectural distinction**: The article treated all convergent limits as evidence of cognitive architecture without acknowledging they could be fitness-shaped. Resolution: Added a paragraph in "The Methodological Insight" section distinguishing architectural from adaptive convergent limits and noting that the convergence methodology identifies species-level limits but additional tools are needed to classify them.

- **Bias blind spot phenomenology unconnected to adaptive framework**: The bias blind spot's distinctive phenomenology (feeling like clarity, not failure) is characteristic of adaptive limits per Trivers' self-deception framework, but this connection was absent. Resolution: Added note in the bias blind spot section connecting the phenomenology to adaptive cognitive limits and Trivers' argument.

- **AI section lacked adaptive methodology**: The "What AI Might Reveal" section discussed AI detecting cross-cultural failures but missed the concrete methodological prediction from the adaptive framework. Resolution: Added note that AI's lack of evolutionary history makes it a probe for distinguishing adaptive from architectural limits.

- **Missing cross-links**: No links to [[adaptive-cognitive-limits]], [[topology-of-cognitive-failure]], or [[cognitive-aversion]]. Resolution: Added inline cross-links and expanded Further Reading section.

- **Citation gap for Chinese/Tibetan Buddhist populations**: Hood's mysticism scale populations named (Chinese Chan/Pure Land Buddhists, Tibetan Buddhists) without specific citations for those populations. Resolution: Added qualifying phrase "across multiple studies" to indicate the evidence comes from a broader literature than the three cited references.

### Counterarguments Considered

All counterarguments from the previous review remain addressed. No new counterarguments identified that aren't already covered by the bedrock disagreements noted in the 2026-01-30 review.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- The evolutionary biology analogy (convergent evolution → convergent limits) remains the article's strongest rhetorical move
- Front-loaded opening summary effectively captures the key methodological insight
- The "What Would Challenge This View" section demonstrates intellectual honesty
- The WEIRD caveat section acknowledges limitations without undermining the core argument
- The Chomsky scope/limits duality is well-articulated
- The bidirectional interaction connection in Relation to Site Perspective remains original and creative

### Enhancements Made

- Added architectural/adaptive distinction paragraph in "The Methodological Insight" section
- Connected bias blind spot phenomenology to adaptive cognitive limits framework (Trivers)
- Added AI as probe for distinguishing adaptive from architectural limits
- Added topology-of-cognitive-failure cross-link in self-perception discussion
- Expanded Further Reading with three new entries (adaptive-cognitive-limits, topology-of-cognitive-failure, cognitive-aversion)
- Qualified Hood mysticism scale citation scope
- Trimmed redundant sentences to maintain length neutrality (removed redundant illustration in Methodological Insight, consolidated bias blind spot description)

### Cross-links Added

- [[adaptive-cognitive-limits]] (3 inline references + Further Reading)
- [[topology-of-cognitive-failure]] (1 inline reference + Further Reading)
- [[cognitive-aversion]] (Further Reading)

## Remaining Items

None. All identified improvements applied within this review.

## Word Count

- Before: 1816 words
- After: 1997 words (+181 words, +10%)
- Status: At soft threshold (2000), length-neutral trimming applied

## Stability Notes

**Bedrock philosophical disagreements** (carried forward from 2026-01-30 review, do NOT re-flag):

1. **Physicalist objection that convergent limits reflect convergent neural architecture rather than genuine voids**: Remains valid philosophical interpretation. The article's claim is methodological, not metaphysical.

2. **Buddhist non-substantialist critique of "void" language**: The voids framework uses "void" as methodological terminology, not metaphysical commitment.

3. **Empirical limitations on "universal" claims**: The article explicitly acknowledges testing across interconnected rather than isolated cultures.

**New stability note from this review:**

4. **Adaptive vs. architectural classification**: The article now acknowledges this distinction without committing to classifying specific limits as one or the other. Future reviews should NOT pressure the article to classify specific examples—the convergence methodology identifies species-level limits; classification is the work of [[adaptive-cognitive-limits]] and related articles.
