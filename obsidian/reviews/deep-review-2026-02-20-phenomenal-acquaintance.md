**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article contained no factual errors, no attribution errors, no dropped qualifiers, no missing required sections, and no broken links. All citations are accurate.

### Medium Issues Found
- **Internal tension between "too immediate for distortion" and fallibility qualifiers**: The introspective justification subsection claimed acquaintance is "too immediate for distortion to enter," but the Acquaintance and Error section offered a more nuanced position. **Resolution**: Qualified the stronger claim to note that directness "limits the channels through which distortion can enter" rather than eliminating every source of error, and added a forward reference to the error section.
- **Bidirectional Interaction argument too quick**: The claim that reliable reports suggest causal efficacy did not distinguish the Map's explanation from physicalist alternatives where brain states cause both experience and reports. **Resolution**: Added a sentence acknowledging the physicalist reply and explaining why it struggles to account for the precision of report-quality tracking.
- **Weak engagement with representationalist/transparency objection**: The article did not address the transparency argument (Tye, Dretske) that introspection reaches represented properties, not intrinsic qualities. **Resolution**: Added a paragraph engaging with transparency and offering the dualist response that transparency presupposes acquaintance.
- **Missing body cross-links**: Frontmatter listed [[phenomenal-consciousness]] and [[modal-structure-of-phenomenal-properties]] but neither appeared in the body text. **Resolution**: Added inline link to [[phenomenal-consciousness]] in the transparency paragraph and wikilink to [[modal-structure-of-phenomenal-properties]] in the limits of description paragraph.
- **Phenomenal conservatism unattributed**: The principle was stated without crediting Michael Huemer. **Resolution**: Added "associated with Michael Huemer" inline.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Cognitive penetrability of perception**: Noted as relevant but not addressed in this review. The article's acquaintance/judgement distinction partially handles this: cognitive penetration affects perceptual *judgement*, not necessarily the acquaintance relation itself. Deferred for future work.
- **Regress worry for pre-conceptual acquaintance**: How does a non-propositional relation ground propositional knowledge? The article acknowledges acquaintance is "more basic than any knowledge claim built upon it" but does not explain the bridging mechanism. Deferred.
- **Dennettian "Cartesian Theatre" objection**: The notion of qualities being "presented" to a subject may presuppose an inner observer. The article's existing distinction between relation and judgement partially addresses this. Not flagged as requiring immediate changes.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Opening paragraph: concrete coffee example, confident claim about epistemic fundamentality
- Three-feature analysis (Immediacy, Non-conceptual character, Subject-dependence): clear structure, well-illustrated
- Acquaintance/knowledge distinction: philosophically precise and important
- Zombie argument deployment: sharp formulation of Chalmers's master argument
- Acquaintance-error resolution: avoids both naive infallibilism and dismissal of first-person authority
- Honest final paragraph: acknowledges that acquaintance alone does not yield metaphysical conclusions

### Enhancements Made
- Added phenomenal intentionality paragraph: connects acquaintance to genuine aboutness via [[phenomenal-intentionality]]
- Added transparency engagement: addresses representationalist objection with dualist response
- Strengthened Bidirectional Interaction argument: acknowledges physicalist alternative and responds
- Qualified introspective justification claim: resolves internal tension with error section
- Added Huemer attribution for phenomenal conservatism
- Added body cross-links to [[modal-structure-of-phenomenal-properties]] and [[phenomenal-consciousness]]

### Cross-links Added
- [[phenomenal-intentionality]]
- [[phenomenal-consciousness]]
- [[modal-structure-of-phenomenal-properties]]

## Remaining Items

- **Cognitive penetrability engagement**: The article could benefit from a brief acknowledgment of the cognitive penetrability debate (Lupyan & Clark, 2015; Firestone & Scholl, 2016) and how it bears on acquaintance's immediacy claim. Low priority since the acquaintance/judgement distinction partially addresses this.
- **Process philosophy connection**: The optimistic review noted structural parallels between acquaintance and Whitehead's prehension. A brief cross-link to [[prehension]] could enrich both articles. Low priority.
- **Additional reference**: Nagel, T. (1974). "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?" could be added to References since the subject-dependence feature directly expresses Nagel's insight. Low priority.

## Stability Notes

The adversarial personas (eliminative materialist, Dennettian physicalist) will always find the concept of phenomenal acquaintance question-begging—they reject the framework that makes the relation meaningful. This is a bedrock disagreement, not a fixable flaw. Future reviews should not re-flag "acquaintance presupposes what it needs to prove" as critical.

The Buddhist concern about the presupposed subject is a genuine philosophical tension with the Map's dualist framework but is not specific to this article. It applies to any article that takes subjects as given. Not a flaw in this article specifically.
