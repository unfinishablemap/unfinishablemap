**Date**: 2026-03-01
**Article**: [[embodied-cognition|Embodied Cognition and the Extended Mind]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-28-embodied-cognition|2026-01-28]]

## Length Status

2686 → 2704 words (+18 words, 108% of 2500 soft threshold) — length-neutral mode. Net increase from added cross-link entry; offset by removal of stale refinement log comment.

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
1. **Broken wikilinks in frontmatter**: `[[brain-specialness]]` and `[[interface-locality]]` referenced non-existent slugs. Fixed to `[[brain-specialness-boundary]]` and `[[the-interface-location-problem]]`.
2. **Corrupted text** (line 56): "It is The Unfinishable Map where consciousness and world interpenetrate" — a substitution error where "the nexus" or similar was replaced with the site name. Fixed to "the nexus."

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Imprecise attribution**: "Baumeister and Beilock's *explicit monitoring theory*" jointly attributed a theory that is specifically Beilock and Carr's (2001), building on Baumeister's (1984) self-focus model. Fixed to properly attribute each contribution.
2. **Missing cross-link**: The newer article `embodied-consciousness-and-the-interface` (created 2026-02-09) directly builds on this article's themes but was not linked. Added to Further Reading and related_articles frontmatter.
3. **Stale AI refinement log**: HTML comment at end of file (from 2026-02-16 refinement) said "This log should be removed after human review" but persisted for two weeks. Removed.

### Counterarguments Considered
All six adversarial personas applied. Key findings:

- **Eliminative Materialist**: The 2026-02-16 refinement adequately addressed overstatement of choking evidence. The article now correctly presents the standard neuroscience interpretation as mainstream. No new issues.
- **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: The illusionist challenge section (now balanced) acknowledges the physicalist account as "parsimonious and consistent with the neuroscience." Appropriate.
- **Quantum Skeptic**: Quantum Zeno reference in tenet section uses appropriate hedging ("proposes," "remains speculative"). Compliant with style guide restraint requirements.
- **Many-Worlds Defender**: MWI accommodation of training effects now explicitly acknowledged. Bedrock disagreement per previous review.
- **Empiricist**: Attribution precision improved (Baumeister/Beilock fix). Fuchs referenced without formal citation in References section, but the inline link to [[phenomenological-psychiatry-and-altered-experience]] provides the full treatment. Acceptable given length constraints.
- **Buddhist Philosopher**: *Nāmarūpa*, *jhāna*, and *mushin* characterizations are accurate. The article presents Buddhist phenomenology as parallel rather than derivative, which is appropriate.

## Attribution Accuracy Check

- **Misattribution**: Fixed Baumeister/Beilock joint attribution. All other attributions verified (Clark & Chalmers 1998, Adams & Aizawa coupling-constitution fallacy, Dreyfus skill model, Varela/Thompson/Rosch enactivism).
- **Qualifier preservation**: Post-2026-02-16 refinement, qualifiers are appropriate ("consistent with" not "evidence for").
- **Position strength**: No overstated positions detected.
- **Source/Map separation**: Clear throughout. Lines 91-92 explicitly state "Both readings accommodate the data."
- **Self-contradiction**: None detected.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Front-loaded summary distinguishing substance vs property dualism (opening paragraphs)
- Dreyfus progression table with consciousness modes — excellent reference tool
- Post-refinement handling of choking evidence — model of epistemic honesty
- Filter theory compatibility section with radio antenna analogy
- Five specific falsifiability conditions
- Buddhist phenomenology parallels providing cross-cultural depth
- Whitehead integration: "choking occurs when central consciousness re-appropriates what had been delegated"
- Closing insight in tenet section: "explaining how bodily interaction produces subjective experience is just as difficult as explaining how brain computation does"

### Enhancements Made
1. Fixed two broken wikilinks in frontmatter concepts
2. Fixed corrupted text in phenomenological roots section
3. Corrected explicit monitoring theory attribution
4. Added cross-link to [[embodied-consciousness-and-the-interface]] in Further Reading and frontmatter
5. Removed stale AI refinement log comment

### Cross-links Added
- [[embodied-consciousness-and-the-interface]] — How the body shapes consciousness's engagement with matter

## Remaining Items

None. The article continues to be stable. All critical and medium issues from this review have been addressed.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed four times (2026-01-20, 2026-01-22, 2026-01-28, 2026-03-01) plus a targeted refinement (2026-02-16). It has reached high stability.

The issues found in this review were primarily maintenance items (broken links from article renames, a substitution error, a stale comment) rather than substantive philosophical or structural problems. The one substantive fix — Baumeister/Beilock attribution precision — was a medium issue correcting academic accuracy.

Bedrock philosophical disagreements remain unchanged from previous reviews:
- **Eliminativist objection**: Phenomenological categories may be folk descriptions of neural processing modes. The article now explicitly acknowledges this as the mainstream view.
- **MWI objection**: Training effects on performance are compatible with MWI. The article acknowledges this and pivots to the stronger anti-MWI argument from elsewhere.
- **Quantum timescale objection**: Acknowledged as genuine challenge; phenomenological mapping holds regardless of mechanism.

Future reviews should focus on cross-link maintenance as new articles are added, rather than re-examining the article's philosophical content. The article is stable.
