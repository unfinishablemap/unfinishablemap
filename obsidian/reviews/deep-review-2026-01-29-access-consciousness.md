**Date**: 2026-01-29
**Article**: [[access-consciousness|Access Consciousness]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-23-access-consciousness|2026-01-23]]
**Context**: Cross-review considering phenomenal-overflow.md insights

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The previous review (2026-01-23) addressed all critical issues including:
- Added missing Nartker et al. (2025) citation
- Expanded deflationary response to overflow
- Added Stapp speculation qualifier
- Engaged MWI proponents' arguments

### Medium Issues Found

- **Overflow section duplicated new dedicated article**: The overflow section (~500 words) covered material now comprehensively treated in the new phenomenal-overflow.md article. Resolution: Condensed to ~200 words with cross-link to [[phenomenal-overflow]].

### Counterarguments Considered

All major counterarguments were already engaged in the previous review:
- Cohen & Dennett's deflationary response—properly engaged
- MWI self-locating uncertainty—presented and rebutted
- Churchland/eliminativist challenge—addressed via illusionism section

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Process philosophy section mapping Whitehead's subjective immediacy/objective immortality onto access/phenomenal distinction (identified as excellent original synthesis in previous review)
- Two-stage model (P-consciousness → attention → A-consciousness → action)
- The strategic argument that acknowledging A-consciousness strengthens dualism
- Cognitive phenomenology discussion presenting both positions fairly
- Mysterianism connection acknowledging cognitive closure possibility

### Enhancements Made

- Added cross-links to new [[phenomenal-overflow]] article throughout
- Condensed overflow section to defer detail to dedicated article
- Added [[phenomenal-overflow]] to frontmatter concepts
- Added [[phenomenal-overflow]] to Further Reading section

### Cross-links Added

- [[phenomenal-overflow]] — in overflow section, attention section, dualism tenet section, and Further Reading

## Word Count

- Before: 3361 words (134% of soft threshold)
- After: 3162 words (126% of soft threshold)
- Change: -199 words

## Remaining Items

The article remains above the 2500-word soft threshold. However, further cuts would require removing substantive content. The process philosophy section (identified as the article's most valuable original contribution) and the tenet sections (required) account for significant length. The article is appropriately comprehensive for a foundational concept.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed twice. The following represent bedrock philosophical disagreements rather than fixable problems:

- **Eliminativist challenge**: Churchland-style eliminativism would reject the access/phenomenal distinction itself as folk-psychological baggage. The article engages illusionism; eliminativism is a deeper rejection the Map doesn't accept.

- **MWI objection**: Many-Worlds defenders will find the indexical-identity argument question-begging. The article now presents their self-locating uncertainty response before the dualist rejoinder. This represents a genuine philosophical standoff.

- **Deflationary response to overflow**: Dennett/Cohen's view that overflow is confabulation remains a live alternative. The article now defers detailed treatment to [[phenomenal-overflow]] rather than adjudicating here.

The article has reached stability. Future reviews should not re-flag these philosophical disagreements as critical issues.
