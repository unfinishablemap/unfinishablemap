# Deep Review: Downward Causation

**Date**: 2026-01-20
**File**: obsidian/concepts/downward-causation.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

1. **No falsifiability section**: The article presented the quantum mechanism without specifying what evidence would challenge it.
   - **Resolution**: Added comprehensive "What Would Challenge This View?" section with five falsifiability conditions (complete neural determinism, elimination of neural quantum effects, confirmation of Many-Worlds, successful illusionist explanation, violations of Born rule probabilities).

2. **No engagement with Many-Worlds**: The site's No Many Worlds tenet is essential for the quantum mechanism to work, but the article never mentioned MWI.
   - **Resolution**: Added "Why Not Many Worlds?" subsection explaining why MWI rejection matters for downward causation.

3. **Missing decoherence challenge**: The comparison table claimed "testability" but didn't address the standard physics objection (Tegmark's decoherence argument).
   - **Resolution**: Added "The Decoherence Challenge" subsection with three-part response (revised calculations, decoherence doesn't determine outcomes, quantum Zeno sidesteps the issue).

4. **No illusionist engagement**: The article didn't address illusionism's radical challenge that there's nothing non-physical to exercise downward causation.
   - **Resolution**: Added "The Illusionist Challenge" section with regress argument response (misrepresentation presupposes presentation).

### Medium Issues Found

1. **No process philosophy alternative**: The article assumed substance/property framework without considering Whitehead's actual occasions.
   - **Resolution**: Added "Process Philosophy Alternative" section presenting Whitehead's framework as complementary to the quantum mechanism.

2. **Self-stultification argument understated**: Brief mention in "Relation to Site's Perspective" didn't develop the argument's full force.
   - **Resolution**: Expanded the epiphenomenalism response to include epistemic consequences.

3. **Missing attention-as-interface connection**: The article discussed quantum Zeno mechanism but didn't connect to the site's attention-as-interface framework.
   - **Resolution**: Added "The Interface Mechanism" subsection in the site perspective section.

### Counterarguments Considered

- **Eliminativist response**: Folk psychological categories like "consciousness causing reports" may be confused notions neuroscience will replace.
  - **Addressed**: Via self-stultification argument expansion—even eliminativists must explain why we *seem* to have phenomenal experiences.

- **Interventionist response**: Woodward's interventionism might vindicate downward causation without quantum effects.
  - **Noted**: Original article already covers this response; no changes needed.

- **Proportionality response**: Yablo's determinables-to-determinates relation might solve overdetermination.
  - **Noted**: Original article adequately covers this; no changes needed.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Clear presentation of Kim's exclusion argument and the drainage problem
- Excellent distinction between weak and strong downward causation
- Well-structured comparison table showing how quantum interactionism differs from alternatives
- Strong framing of the "Relation to Site's Perspective" section

### Enhancements Made

1. Added process philosophy alternative (Whitehead's actual occasions) as complementary framework
2. Added illusionist challenge and regress-based response
3. Added comprehensive falsifiability section
4. Added decoherence challenge with three-part response
5. Added Many-Worlds section explaining why MWI rejection matters
6. Expanded self-stultification argument
7. Added attention-as-interface connection
