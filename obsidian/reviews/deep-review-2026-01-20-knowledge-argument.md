## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None

### Medium Issues Found
- **Unverified survey statistic**: Removed specific "82% of non-philosophers" claim that lacked citation. Replaced with general statement about survey support for the intuition.
- **Missing falsifiability section**: Added "What Would Challenge This View?" with five conditions that would undermine the argument.
- **Missing illusionist engagement**: Added "The Illusionist Response" subsection engaging with Frankish/Dennett's radical dismissal and the regress problem it faces.

### Counterarguments Considered
- Illusionist response (Mary learns nothing because phenomenal facts don't exist): Addressed with regress argument—explaining why Mary *seems* to learn requires phenomenal appearance.
- Introspection unreliability: Addressed with new section distinguishing process from content access and citing Fox et al. training evidence.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear formal structure of the argument (5-step formalization)
- Good treatment of the three main physicalist responses (Ability, Phenomenal Concepts, Dennett)
- Strong connection to convergence argument with other anti-materialist arguments
- Effective treatment of Jackson's self-rejection and why it doesn't settle the debate

### Enhancements Made
- Added "The Illusionist Response" subsection under Physicalist Responses
- Added "The Introspection Question" section addressing how Mary knows she learned
- Added "Process Philosophy Perspective" section with Whitehead's actual occasions
- Added "What Would Challenge This View?" section with five falsification conditions
- Expanded and clarified the Relation to Site Perspective section

### Cross-links Added
- [[illusionism]] — engagement with radical physicalist denial
- [[introspection]] — how Mary recognizes phenomenal change
- [[russellian-monism]] — structure/intrinsic nature distinction
- [[philosophical-zombies]] — already present but now in frontmatter concepts

### References Added

- Frankish, K. (2016) — illusionism paper
- Nisbett, R. E., & Wilson, T. D. (1977) — introspection critique
