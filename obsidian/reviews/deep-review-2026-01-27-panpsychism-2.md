**Date**: 2026-01-27
**Article**: [[panpsychism|Panpsychism]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-27-panpsychism|2026-01-27 (earlier today)]]
**Context**: Cross-review considering process-philosophy insights

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- None

### Medium Issues Found
- **Missing process-philosophy cross-link**: The Whitehead section discussed process philosophy extensively without linking to the newly created [[process-philosophy]] article. → Added cross-link and expanded the connection to process philosophy's treatment of phenomenal unity.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Eliminativist challenge**: Previous review noted the article dismisses "deflationary strategies" without detailed engagement with Dennett's heterophenomenology. This remains acceptable given tenet commitments—engaging at length would require substantial expansion inconsistent with length-neutral mode.
- **Buddhist no-self**: Cross-link to [[buddhism-and-dualism]] exists; deeper integration would expand the article beyond soft threshold.

### Issues NOT Re-Flagged
- All issues from previous review (2026-01-27 earlier) marked as resolved remain resolved
- The article has reached stability; no oscillation needed

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Strong opening summary (truncation-resilient)
- Clear Key Differences comparison table
- Fair treatment of panpsychism's strengths alongside critique
- Good integration of empirical cases (C. elegans, Hydra, slime molds)
- Excellent Whitehead section (from previous review)
- Good coverage of Russellian panpsychism variants

### Enhancements Made
1. **Process-philosophy integration**: Added [[process-philosophy]] cross-link in Whitehead section, connecting to the new article
2. **Phenomenal unity connection**: Added explanation of how process philosophy's notion of phenomenal unity as achievement relates to the combination problem—a distinctive response that differs from both aggregation and separate-substance models
3. **Further Reading expanded**: Added [[process-philosophy]] entry
4. **Frontmatter updated**: Added process-philosophy to concepts list
5. **Length-neutral trimming**: Condensed empirical boundary cases section (C. elegans, slime molds) to offset additions

### Cross-links Added
- [[process-philosophy]] — Whitehead's framework where experience is fundamental to actuality

## Word Count

- Before: 2605 words (104% of 2500 target)
- After: 2602 words (104% of 2500 target)
- Change: -3 words (length-neutral)

## Remaining Items

None. This cross-review successfully integrated process-philosophy insights without expanding the article beyond its current length.

## Stability Notes

The article has now been reviewed twice on the same day (first for intrinsic-nature-void integration, now for process-philosophy cross-review). The article is stable:

- Core arguments are sound and well-structured
- All major cross-links are now in place (process-philosophy, intrinsic-nature-void, combination-problem, etc.)
- Philosophical disagreements with eliminativism, MWI, etc. represent bedrock differences, not fixable flaws
- The article fairly presents panpsychism while explaining the Map's alternative

Future reviews should not re-flag the same issues. The article has converged to a good state—further changes should only occur if:
1. New content is added to the Map that requires integration
2. Factual errors are discovered
3. The user requests specific changes
