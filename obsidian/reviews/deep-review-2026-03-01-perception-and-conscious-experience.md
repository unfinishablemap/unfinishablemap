**Date**: 2026-03-01
**Article**: [[perception-and-conscious-experience|Perception and Conscious Experience]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-02-25-perception-and-conscious-experience|2026-02-25]]

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The article remains stable after three reviews. All 6 citations correctly attributed. No new issues identified.

### Medium Issues Found

None. All issues from the initial review (dissociation argument, transparency argument, phenomenal overflow contestation) remain resolved.

### Low Issues Found

1. **Binding mechanisms without citations**: Previously noted (2026-02-25). Deferred — standard textbook mechanisms in a survey article.

### Counterarguments Considered

All six adversarial personas engaged. No new counterarguments beyond those already addressed:
- **Eliminative Materialist**: Article doesn't engage eliminativism directly; bedrock disagreement, not a flaw
- **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: Dissociations and transparency sections engage physicalist responses adequately
- **Quantum Skeptic**: Quantum section properly hedged ("remains speculative")
- **Many-Worlds Defender**: MWI tenet intentionally omitted from Relation to Site Perspective; confirmed intentional in previous review
- **Empiricist**: All empirical claims cited; binding mechanisms are standard
- **Buddhist Philosopher**: Perspectival character section takes the subject as given; bedrock philosophical difference

### Attribution Accuracy Check

All 6 references verified (confirmed across 3 reviews):
- Block (2007): Phenomenal overflow argument ✓
- Nagel (1974): Perspectival character ✓
- Weiskrantz (1986): Blindsight ✓
- Simons & Chabris (1999): Inattentional blindness (gorilla experiment) ✓
- Marcel (1983): Subliminal perception / masked priming ✓
- Sperling (1960): Iconic memory paradigm ✓

No misattribution, dropped qualifiers, or source/Map conflation found.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Excellent front-loaded opening summary surviving truncation
- Strong cumulative structure: concrete empirical cases → abstract phenomenal features → binding → tenet connections
- Good use of specific empirical examples (blindsight, gorilla experiment, Sperling)
- Thorough Relation to Site Perspective covering 4 tenets with substantive connections
- Appropriate restraint on quantum mechanisms (briefly mentioned, properly hedged)
- Cross-modal and non-perceptual experience section adds genuine breadth
- Solid references section with 6 genuine academic citations

### Enhancements Made

**Primary focus: Additional orphan integration (5 inbound links added)**

The previous review (2026-02-25) added 12+ inbound links using lowercase wikilinks. An additional 4 links using uppercase `[[Perception-and-conscious-experience` existed but were missed by case-sensitive link checking. This review adds 5 more inbound links from files that discuss perception-related content:

#### Concepts (3):
- [[embodied-cognition]] — Added inline link in enactivism section where perception is described as sensorimotor skill
- [[phenomenal-binding-and-holism]] — Added Further Reading entry noting perceptual experience as paradigm case of binding
- [[inverted-qualia]] — Added Further Reading entry noting perceptual qualia as paradigm case
- [[phenomenology]] — Added inline link where qualitative character of perception is discussed as evidence for first-person irreducibility

#### Topics (1):
- [[sensorimotor-contingencies-and-the-interface]] — Added inline link in opening paragraph ("Perception is the mastery...")

### Cross-links Added

5 new inbound links (listed above). The article now has 20+ inbound links total across lowercase and uppercase wikilink variants.

## Word Count

2102 words → 2102 words (no change to target article; changes were inbound links only)

## Remaining Items

None. The article has reached stability after three reviews.

## Stability Notes

- The article is **stable**. Three reviews have now confirmed no critical or medium issues. Future reviews should not re-flag the dissociation or transparency arguments.
- The deliberate omission of MWI from the Relation to Site Perspective is confirmed as intentional.
- The six adversarial personas will always find philosophical disagreement with dualist content — this is expected, not fixable.
- Attribution accuracy confirmed across all 6 citations in three separate reviews.
- **Case-sensitivity note**: Some inbound links use `[[Perception-and-conscious-experience` (capital P). Link-checking tools should be case-insensitive for wikilinks to avoid false orphan detection. Files with uppercase links include: intentionality.md, explanatory-gap.md, conscious-vs-unconscious-processing.md, hard-problem-of-consciousness.md.
- The article now has 20+ inbound links and should not be flagged as orphaned in future checks.
