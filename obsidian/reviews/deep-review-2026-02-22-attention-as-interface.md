**Date**: 2026-02-22
**Article**: [[attention-as-interface|Attention as Interface]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-20-attention-as-interface|2026-01-20]]
**Context**: Cross-review considering voluntary-attention-control-mechanisms

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The article has matured through previous review and subsequent edits.

### Medium Issues Found

- **Weak argument at line 106**: "If consciousness were identical to neural processing, willed and instructed attention should show identical signatures—both are 'attention,' after all" was a straw man. No physicalist would claim all instances of a cognitive category must have identical signatures. **Resolved** — Replaced with more precise argument: the additional computational load of internally generating a target does not explain *why* bidirectional coherence and theta oscillations appear; those mark a qualitatively different process.
- **Block attribution**: "Block's iconic memory experiments" implied Block ran the experiments. **Resolved** — Changed to "Block's analysis of iconic memory experiments (the Sperling paradigm)."
- **Missing cross-link to voluntary-attention-control-mechanisms**: The new concept article deeply extends the willed attention section of this article but was not linked. **Resolved** — Added to concepts frontmatter and Further Reading.

### Low Issues Found

- **Grammar**: "This is computational description" → "This is a computational description." **Resolved.**

### Counterarguments Considered

- Eliminative materialist: willed/instructed difference could be computational load, not evidence of consciousness → Addressed by noting theta and bidirectional coherence are qualitatively different, not harder versions of the same process
- Quantum skeptic: decoherence timescale claims remain vague → Existing from previous review, deferred (not a cross-review concern)

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- Opening hypothesis statement: clear, front-loaded, survives truncation
- Core claims table: excellent structured communication
- Motor selection convergence section: compelling Rizzolatti + Cisek synthesis
- Falsification conditions: demonstrates intellectual honesty
- Meditation section: effective phenomenological grounding

### Enhancements Made

1. Added spectral dissociation evidence (low gamma vs high gamma) to the "Attention and Consciousness Are Dissociable" section, strengthening the separability argument with a fourth line of evidence
2. Added salience network (anterior insula + ACC) to Candidate Selection Sites table
3. Tightened the willed attention argument with more precise reasoning about why bidirectional coherence and theta oscillations are qualitatively distinct from computational load
4. Added cross-link to voluntary-attention-control-mechanisms for the full mechanistic analysis
5. Fixed Block attribution (Sperling paradigm)
6. Fixed grammar in Predictive Processing section

### Cross-links Added

- [[voluntary-attention-control-mechanisms]] (frontmatter + Further Reading + inline reference)

## Remaining Items

None — all identified issues addressed. The article is approaching convergence stability.

## Stability Notes

- This article was first reviewed 2026-01-20 and has been substantively improved since. The current review found zero critical issues and only medium-level refinements, indicating convergence.
- The eliminative materialist objection that willed/instructed differences are "just more computation" is a philosophical standpoint disagreement, not a fixable flaw. The article now addresses it directly by distinguishing qualitative from quantitative neural differences. Future reviews should not re-flag this.
- Quantum decoherence timescale vagueness (Hagan et al. "several orders of magnitude") is a known imprecision carried from source material. It could be refined if specific figures are researched, but is not critical to the article's argument since the Zeno mechanism is presented as one candidate among several.
