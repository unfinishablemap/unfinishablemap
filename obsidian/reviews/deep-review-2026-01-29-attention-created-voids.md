**Date**: 2026-01-29
**Article**: [[attention-created-voids|Attention-Created Voids]]
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None. The article is philosophically coherent within its framework. Attribution accuracy passed all checks.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Meditator claim lacked support**: Line 141 claimed "Reports from advanced meditators do not describe this" without citation
   - **Resolution**: Reworded to "Reports from contemplative traditions describe heightened awareness of the structure itself—noticing the margin as margin—but not its elimination"—defensible observation rather than empirical claim

2. **Neural correlates objection unaddressed**: Materialist accounts (biased competition, lateral inhibition) explain attention mechanisms without dualism
   - **Resolution**: Added explicit acknowledgment in Dualism tenet section—neural mechanisms explain the *how*, but not the phenomenal character of exclusion

3. **Inline citation missing**: Invisible gorilla experiment referenced without citation in text
   - **Resolution**: Added "(Simons & Chabris, 1999)" inline

### Counterarguments Considered
1. **Heterophenomenology (Dennett)**: Introspective reports might describe beliefs about consciousness, not its actual structure
   - **How addressed**: The revised Dualism section now distinguishes mechanism from phenomenology, making clear the claim is about felt quality, not information processing

2. **Neural explanation suffices (Churchland)**: Voids are just reduced neural activation
   - **How addressed**: Acknowledged neural mechanisms explain the *how*; maintained the gap is in explaining *why there's something it is like*

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
1. The five named phenomenological patterns (peripheral shimmer, lost ground, fringe-sense, suppressive dark, alternation frustration)—unique vocabulary for discussing these experiences
2. The clean conceptual argument: "finite access entails exclusion"
3. The distinction between marginalised (present but not focal) and excluded (not present at all)
4. The "What Would Challenge This View" section providing clear falsifiability conditions
5. The "This Void is Different" section clarifying the void's uniqueness among Map voids

### Enhancements Made
1. Tightened phenomenology section introduction (removed redundant question)
2. Strengthened Dualism tenet connection by explicitly engaging with materialist mechanisms
3. Improved citation practices with inline reference

### Cross-links Added
None new—existing cross-links are comprehensive

## Remaining Items
None. All identified issues addressed within this review.

## Stability Notes

This article is philosophically mature. The adversarial personas (particularly the Eliminative Materialist and Hard-Nosed Physicalist) disagree with the position, but this is expected—these are bedrock philosophical disagreements about phenomenology, not fixable problems. Future reviews should NOT re-flag:

- "Materialist accounts can explain attention without dualism" — The revised text explicitly engages this and maintains the phenomenology/mechanism distinction
- "Introspective reports are unreliable" — This is a philosophical commitment the Map rejects; the article's claims are about phenomenal structure, not neural facts

The article should be considered stable unless substantive new content is added or errors are discovered.
