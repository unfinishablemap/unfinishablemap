**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Article**: [[computational-cognitive-limits|Computational Cognitive Limits]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-29-computational-cognitive-limits|2026-01-29]]
**Context**: Cross-review with new incompleteness research (voids-incompleteness-void-2026-01-31.md)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found

None. The article was already in good shape from the previous review.

### Medium Issues Found

None requiring correction. The previous review had addressed the major issues:
- Rice's theorem description (corrected)
- Lucas-Penrose framing (properly balanced)
- Wolfram's computational irreducibility (appropriately hedged)

### Counterarguments Considered

All six adversarial personas engaged with the content:

1. **Eliminative Materialist**: The article correctly notes mainstream rejection of Lucas-Penrose
2. **Hard-Nosed Physicalist**: Criticism that we "merely follow procedures" is acknowledged in the text
3. **Quantum Skeptic**: Penrose's quantum gravitational claims appropriately hedged as "highly speculative"
4. **Many-Worlds Defender**: Tenet-level disagreement, not a fixable issue (noted in previous review)
5. **Empiricist**: Good distinction between proven math results and speculative consciousness implications
6. **Buddhist Philosopher**: Framework-level disagreement about reification of consciousness (noted in previous review)

### Attribution Accuracy Check

All attributions verified:
- Rice's theorem: Henry Rice, 1953 (correct)
- Gödel: 1931 (correct)
- Turing: 1936 (correct)
- Wolfram quotes: Direct from *A New Kind of Science* (correct)
- Lucas-Penrose: Correctly attributed (correct)

No misattribution issues found.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved

- **Four-part phenomenology taxonomy**: "Infinite regress," "asymptotic approach," "dissolving prediction," "recognising without grasping" — original contribution maintained
- **Opening summary**: Front-loads the key claim about mathematical proof of unknowability
- **Hedged language**: Appropriately tentative when moving from math to consciousness
- **Tenet connections**: Well-drawn connections to all five tenets

### Enhancements Made

1. **Added Gödel's Disjunction** to the Gödel section — this more precise formulation from the new research states: "Either the human mathematical mind cannot be captured by an algorithm, or there are absolutely undecidable problems." Both horns mark voids.

2. **Added Hofstadter's strange loops connection** to the Rice's theorem section — connects the syntax/semantics gap to Hofstadter's concept of self-referential structures that generate meaning through self-modelling yet cannot fully comprehend themselves.

3. **Tightened Tractability section** — removed redundant phrases to maintain length-neutrality while adding new content.

### Cross-links Added

- Strengthened connection to [[self-reference-paradox]] with Hofstadter context

## Remaining Items

None. All cross-review integration from the new incompleteness research has been completed.

## Stability Notes

This article has now been reviewed twice. The following represent settled matters:

- **MWI defenders will reject the collapse framing**: Tenet-level commitment (No Many Worlds), not an error
- **Eliminative materialists will reject the phenomenology framing**: Reflects the Map's commitment to taking consciousness seriously
- **The Lucas-Penrose argument is contested**: Article now correctly presents it as a minority position while preserving philosophical interest
- **Gödel's Disjunction is now incorporated**: Both horns generate voids — this is the strongest available framing

Future reviews should focus on new research integration rather than re-examining these settled philosophical positions.
