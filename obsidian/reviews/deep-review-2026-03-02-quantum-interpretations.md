**Date**: 2026-03-02
**Article**: [[quantum-interpretations|Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics]]
**Previous review**: [[deep-review-2026-01-28-quantum-interpretations|2026-01-28]]

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
- **Broken link in Further Reading**: `[[consciousness-and-quantum-measurement]]` referenced an article that does not exist anywhere in the vault. *Resolution*: Removed the broken link. The measurement-problem and quantum-consciousness articles already cover this territory.

- **Inaccurate reference citation**: Reference 1 cited "Nature Physics Survey (August 2025)" but the actual publication was in Nature (not Nature Physics). Web search confirmed: Nature, 643(8074), August 2025. *Resolution*: Corrected to proper Nature citation with volume/issue.

### Medium Issues Found
- **MWI characterization overstatement** (line 179): "MWI explicitly denies that consciousness plays any role in physics" — MWI doesn't explicitly deny consciousness's role; it simply doesn't require it. *Resolution*: Changed to "MWI provides no role for consciousness in physics."

### Counterarguments Considered
All six adversarial personas engaged. Key counterarguments are bedrock disagreements identified in the 2026-01-28 review and NOT re-flagged:
- Eliminative Materialist: the article favors dualist interpretations (expected given site tenets)
- MWI Defender: indexical identity argument remains unsatisfying to MWI proponents (bedrock disagreement)
- Quantum Skeptic: decoherence timescale debate is acknowledged with appropriate hedging
- Hard-Nosed Physicalist: contemplative evidence section treats phenomenological reports as relevant to physics (this is the Map's position)
- Buddhist Philosopher: anattā treatment is accurate and appropriately qualified
- Empiricist: Nature survey reference now properly cited

### Attribution Accuracy Check
- Rovelli quote ("There is nothing subjective, idealistic, or mentalistic, in RQM") — verified as accurate characterization
- Von Neumann/Wigner consciousness-collapse attribution — standard and correct
- Nature 2025 survey claims (no majority interpretation) — confirmed via web search: Copenhagen at 36%, MWI at 15%
- No source/Map conflation detected; Map interpretations are clearly labeled throughout
- No dropped qualifiers or misattributed positions found

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Front-loaded opening clearly states that interpretations remain genuinely open
- Structured subsections (Core claims → Consciousness role → Site compatibility) for each interpretation
- Comparison table provides excellent quick reference
- Process philosophy section adds distinctive philosophical framing
- Contemplative evidence grounds abstract claims in phenomenology
- "What Would Challenge This View?" section demonstrates intellectual honesty
- All five tenets addressed substantively in Relation to Site Perspective
- Cross-reference network to spontaneous-collapse-theories and time-symmetric-physics (added Feb 2026)

### Enhancements Made
- Added [[prebiotic-collapse]] to Further Reading (referenced in body but missing from Further Reading)
- Fixed Nature citation to include proper journal, volume, and issue
- Softened MWI characterization for accuracy

### Cross-links Added
- [[prebiotic-collapse]] in Further Reading (Consciousness-Physics Interface subsection)

## Length Management

**Word count**: 2342 → 2346 (+4 words)

Operated in length-neutral mode (94% of 2500 soft threshold). Removed one Further Reading entry (broken consciousness-and-quantum-measurement link, -14 words) and added one (prebiotic-collapse, +10 words). Other changes were substitutions. Net impact negligible.

## Remaining Items

None. All critical and medium issues addressed.

## Stability Notes

This is the third deep review of this article (2026-01-21, 2026-01-28, 2026-03-02). The article is now stable. Changes since the last review (2026-02-05) were mechanical — link standardization and cross-references to newly created articles. This review found only a broken link, an inaccurate reference citation, and one overstatement — all minor precision fixes.

Bedrock disagreements (carried forward from 2026-01-28 review):
- MWI proponents will always find the indexical argument unsatisfying
- Eliminative materialists will always disagree with the core premise that consciousness is relevant to physics
- QBism advocates will resist the realist framing
- These represent fundamental philosophical commitments, not fixable problems

The article should not need further review unless substantive content changes are made or new related articles require integration.
