# Deep Review: Intuitive Dualism

**Date**: 2026-01-24
**File**: concepts/intuitive-dualism.md
**Previous review**: 2026-01-20 (initial creation)

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

Six adversarial personas applied:

### Eliminative Materialist (Churchland)
- Noted that both "intuitive materialism" and "intuitive dualism" presuppose phenomenal consciousness exists
- Raised concern that contemplative evidence uncritically accepts meditators' reports

### Hard-Nosed Physicalist (Dennett)
- **Medium issue found**: The regress response to illusionism was too quick; didn't properly engage with Frankish's quasi-phenomenal properties argument
- Resolution: Expanded the regress response section with three specific considerations against Frankish's view

### Quantum Skeptic (Tegmark)
- **Low issue found**: Minimal Quantum Interaction section was thin, didn't connect to site's quantum timing work
- Resolution: Added cross-link to quantum-neural-timing-constraints and integration with voluntary-attention timescales

### Many-Worlds Defender (Deutsch)
- **Low issue found**: No Many Worlds section assertion about branching underdeveloped
- Resolution: Kept as-is; the haecceity reference is sufficient for this article's scope

### Empiricist (Popper)
- **Medium issue found**: Barrett et al. 2021 cited repeatedly without sample sizes or methodology detail
- Resolution: Added specific sample sizes (n=300 to n=408) and population descriptions

### Buddhist Philosopher (Nagarjuna)
- **Low issue found**: Buddhist section brief, doesn't engage Madhyamaka critique
- Resolution: Added cross-link to mysterianism-cognitive-closure and brief note on cognitive limits

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

Six sympathetic personas applied:

### Strengths Preserved
- Genetic fallacy analysis (lines 107-109): excellent framing
- Symmetric problem (lines 111-113): compelling argument
- Process philosophy section (lines 144-161): one of the article's strongest sections
- "Explaining the belief doesn't explain the explanandum" (line 118): perfectly Nagelian

### Enhancements Made
1. **Expanded illusionism response**: Added three specific considerations against Frankish's quasi-phenomenal properties
2. **Added empirical detail**: Barrett et al. sample sizes and populations now specified
3. **Strengthened contemplative section**: Acknowledged trained introspection is contested; added Fox et al. 2012 accuracy finding
4. **Quantum integration**: Connected Minimal Quantum Interaction to quantum-neural-timing-constraints and voluntary-attention
5. **Bidirectional evidence**: Added Schwartz OCD studies as direct evidence for mental causation

### Cross-links Added
- [[consciousness]] — New hub article
- [[quantum-neural-timing-constraints]] — Connects timing work to this debate
- [[stapp-quantum-mind]] — Observer-dependent quantum framework
- [[voluntary-attention]] — The ~300ms mechanism
- [[first-person-third-person-methodology]] — Methodology debates
- [[mysterianism-cognitive-closure]] — Cognitive limits connection

## Remaining Items

None. All identified issues addressed or determined to be out of scope for this article.

## Changes Summary

1. Updated frontmatter: added consciousness, stapp-quantum-mind, voluntary-attention, first-person-third-person-methodology to concepts; added quantum-neural-timing-constraints, mysterianism-cognitive-closure to related_articles
2. Barrett et al. section: added specific sample sizes (2,000+ total) and population breakdown
3. Regress Response section: expanded from 2 paragraphs to 4, with three specific considerations against Frankish
4. Contemplative Challenge section: added sceptic objection and Fox et al. accuracy response
5. Minimal Quantum Interaction section: added paragraph connecting to quantum-neural-timing-constraints
6. Bidirectional Interaction section: added paragraph on voluntary attention and Schwartz OCD evidence
7. Buddhist Analysis section: added mysterianism-cognitive-closure cross-link
8. Further Reading: added 6 new entries (consciousness, quantum-neural-timing-constraints, stapp-quantum-mind, voluntary-attention, first-person-third-person-methodology, mysterianism-cognitive-closure)
