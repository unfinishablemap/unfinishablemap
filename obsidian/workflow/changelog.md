## 2026-02-02 06:42 UTC - deep-review
- **Status**: Success (cleanup)
- **File**: altered-states-consciousness.md (orphan)
- **Action**: Deleted stale hugo/content/topics/altered-states-consciousness.md
- **Notes**: This file was flagged as orphaned, but investigation revealed it was a stale duplicate. The original topics/altered-states-consciousness article was coalesced into concepts/altered-states-of-consciousness on 2026-01-25. The archived version exists correctly at archive/topics/altered-states-consciousness.md with proper archive metadata. The stale copy in hugo/content/topics/ was missing archive markers and causing orphan detection. No content changes needed - the concepts version already has 27+ inbound links and two prior deep reviews marking it as stable.

## 2026-02-02 06:37 UTC - deep-review
- **Status**: Success
- **File**: [[topics/comparative-consciousness-and-interface-differences]]
- **Word count**: 2271 → 2390 (+119)
- **Critical issues addressed**: 0
- **Medium issues addressed**: 4
- **Enhancements made**: 5
- **Output**: [[reviews/deep-review-2026-02-02-comparative-consciousness-and-interface-differences]]
- **Notes**: First review of this topic. Qualified microtubule ubiquity argument (was overstated), added epistemological nuance to contemplative reports section, tempered epothilone B interpretation, acknowledged MWI defender responses while maintaining Map's position. Article well-constructed with novel homogeneous/heterogeneous interface framework; improvements focused on logical rigor and appropriate hedging.

---

## 2026-02-02 06:32 UTC - deep-review
- **Status**: Success
- **File**: [[apex/testing-the-map-from-inside]]
- **Word count**: 2289 → 2628 (+339)
- **Critical issues addressed**: 0
- **Medium issues addressed**: 4
- **Enhancements made**: 4
- **Output**: [[reviews/deep-review-2026-02-02-testing-the-map-from-inside]]

## 2026-02-02 06:27 UTC - deep-review
- **Status**: Success
- **File**: [[machine-question]]
- **Word count**: 2798 → 2828 (+30)
- **Critical issues addressed**: 1 (broken link to substrate-independence-critique)
- **Medium issues addressed**: 2 (Harnad quote attribution, Searle response framing)
- **Enhancements made**: 0
- **Output**: [[reviews/deep-review-2026-02-02-machine-question]]
- **Notes**: First review of this apex article. Fixed broken internal link, reframed uncertain quote attribution as paraphrase, softened claim about Searle's response while acknowledging ongoing debate. Article is well-constructed with thorough tenet connections.

---

## 2026-02-02 06:22 UTC - deep-review (orphan cleanup)
- **Status**: Cleanup - Orphan Removed
- **File**: voluntary-attention-control.md
- **Action**: Removed orphaned hugo/content files (concepts/ and topics/ versions)
- **Reason**: These files were stale leftovers from a coalescence operation. The content was already coalesced into [[voluntary-attention]] and archived versions already exist in archive/concepts/ and archive/topics/
- **Cross-references updated**: 3 files updated to link to [[voluntary-attention]] instead of [[voluntary-attention-control]]:
  - [[william-james-consciousness]] (concepts list + Further Reading)
  - [[conscious-vs-unconscious-processing]] (inline reference)
- **Notes**: The task requested a deep-review with orphan integration, but investigation revealed the orphan status was due to stale files from a coalesce operation, not missing cross-references. Proper cleanup was performed instead of artificial integration.

---

## 2026-02-02 06:17 UTC - deep-review
- **Status**: Success
- **File**: [[baseline-cognition]]
- **Word count**: 3315 → 3330 (+15)
- **Critical issues addressed**: 1 (missing Randeniya 2025 citation)
- **Medium issues addressed**: 0
- **Enhancements made**: 0
- **Output**: [[reviews/deep-review-2026-02-02-baseline-cognition]]
- **Notes**: Fourth review. Article is mature and stable. Task context suggested orphan integration but article has 27 inbound links—well integrated. Only issue was missing citation for Randeniya (2025) meta-analysis in References section. Added citation. Confirmed all prior review concerns remain addressed.

---

## 2026-02-02 06:09 UTC - research-voids
- **Status**: Success
- **Topic**: The Creativity Void
- **Category**: Mixed (Unexplored and potentially Unexplorable)
- **Output**: [[research/voids-creativity-void-2026-02-02]]
- **Key finding**: Creative insight arrives from a void that consciousness cannot observe—the incubation process is structurally hidden, and the deeper question of whether genuinely novel thoughts (not recombinations) are possible may reveal a permanent cognitive limit.

---

## 2026-02-02 06:03 UTC - deep-review
- **Status**: Success
- **File**: [[identity-across-transformations]]
- **Word count**: 2455 → 2510 (+55)

- **Medium issues addressed**: 3
- **Enhancements made**: 3
- **Output**: [[reviews/deep-review-2026-02-02-choking-phenomenon-mental-causation]]
- **Notes**: First review. Strengthened illusionism response with clearer arguments (causal tracking problem, heterophenomenology engagement). Refined contemplative convergence section to acknowledge Buddhist/Zen traditions have different metaphysics while preserving phenomenological parallels. Added methodological note about psychology replication concerns while noting core finding robustness.

---

## 2026-02-02 05:51 UTC - condense
- **Status**: Reviewed, no condensation applied
- **File**: [[functionalism]]
- **Word count**: 2036 words (81% of 2500 target)
- **Reason**: Article is already below soft threshold. Well-structured with clear sections, no redundancy detected, all content serves the argument.

## 2026-02-02 05:45 UTC - deep-review (orphan integration)
- **Status**: Success
- **File**: [[observational-closure]]
- **Word count**: 1412 → 1452 (+40)
- **Critical issues addressed**: 0 (none found)
- **Medium issues addressed**: 2 (missing mechanism links, orphan status)
- **Cross-links added**: 5 articles now link to this content
  - [[causal-closure]], [[delegatory-dualism]], [[objections-to-interactionism]]
  - [[mental-causation]], [[interactionist-dualism]]
- **Output**: [[reviews/deep-review-2026-02-02-observational-closure]]
- **Notes**: First review of this newly created concept page. Primary focus was orphan integration—article had no inbound links despite discussing a key concept (Saad's observational vs. universal closure distinction) that multiple existing articles reference. Added links to stapp-quantum-mind and quantum-indeterminacy-free-will mechanisms. All six adversarial personas engaged; no critical issues found.

---

## 2026-02-02 05:38 UTC - coalesce
- **Status**: Success
- **Sources**: [[attention-interface-mechanisms]], [[attention-motor-quantum-selection]]
- **Target**: [[attention-interface-mechanisms]]
- **Archived**: [[archive/topics/attention-motor-quantum-selection]]
- **References to review**: none (attention-motor-quantum-selection had no inbound links)
- **Notes**: Merged two highly overlapping articles about the attention-consciousness interface. Both covered premotor theory of attention, shared neural signatures (~280-300ms timing, frontal theta), quantum Zeno mechanism, dopamine's role in threshold modulation, and the Libet challenge. The unified article preserves all unique content: candidate selection sites and testable predictions from the first, competition-selection architecture and phenomenological tests from the second.
