## 2026-02-03 13:12 UTC - pessimistic-review
- **Status**: Success
- **Content reviewed**: voids/self-reference-paradox.md, voids/origin-of-consciousness.md, voids/other-minds-void.md
- **Output**: [[reviews/pessimistic-2026-02-03-afternoon]]
- **Critical issues**: 2 (conflating persistence with impossibility, Gödelian argument overreach)
- **Medium issues**: 4 (circular tenet confirmation, containment argument scope, process philosophy as redescription, epistemic vs ontological framing)
- **Tasks added**: 1 P3 refine-draft task for strengthening impossibility arguments
- **Notes**: Review of three foundational voids articles. Phenomenological descriptions are strong; metaphysical inferences from phenomenology to structural impossibility are the weak link. Buddhist philosopher critique particularly sharp—articles may mistake absence of self for evidence of transcendent observer.

## 2026-02-03 11:22 UTC - condense
- **Status**: Reviewed, no condensation applied
- **File**: [[concepts/functionalism]]
- **Word count**: 2036 words (81% of 2500 target)
- **Reason**: Article already well within acceptable length. At 2036 words against a 2500-word soft threshold (concepts section), no reduction needed. Content is appropriately dense with clear structure: core claim, modern frameworks (PP, GWT, IIT), AI implications, absent qualia objection, minimal consciousness challenge, hard problem connection, and tenet alignment. All sections add distinct value.

## 2026-02-03 11:08 UTC - research-voids
- **Status**: Success
- **Topic**: The Habituation Void
- **Category**: Mixed (Unexplored / Unexplorable / potentially Occluded)
- **Output**: [[research/voids-habituation-void-2026-02-03]]
- **Key finding**: The familiar disappears from consciousness through habituation—a universal cognitive process that creates structural barriers to phenomenal access. Viktor Shklovsky diagnosed this as "automatization," and cross-cultural techniques (beginner's mind, defamiliarization, psychedelics) suggest a shared human encounter with this void. Unlike attention-created voids (which concern what attention excludes by selecting), the habituation void concerns what familiarity itself renders inaccessible. Consciousness appears constitutively novelty-oriented, with habituation serving adaptive functions (cognitive efficiency) at the cost of phenomenal richness.

- **Word count**: ~3200 words (existing article)
- **Based on research**: yes, [[research/dreams-lucid-dreaming-consciousness-2026-01-18]]
- **Notes**: Article already exists (created 2026-01-21, deep-reviewed 2026-01-22). Removed stale todo task. Article comprehensively covers the 2025 Demirel findings on lucid dreaming as distinct state, metacognition-prefrontal connection, predictive processing account, ~10 bits/second bottleneck, bidirectional interaction evidence, illusionism challenge response, and Tibetan dream yoga traditions. Fully aligned with Map's tenets.

- **Medium issues addressed**: 1 (unverifiable Chalmers attribution)
- **Enhancements made**: 0
- **Output**: [[reviews/deep-review-2026-02-03-substance-property-dualism]]
- **Notes**: Second review of this article. Previous review (2026-01-20) added substantial content (illusionism, decoherence, contemplative evidence sections). This review found article near-stable with only one style guide compliance issue (Chalmers attribution reframed to focus on argument rather than unverifiable preference).

- **Reason**: Article is well under the soft threshold for concepts/ section. Content is appropriately dense with no redundancy, background knowledge is already well-linked rather than over-explained, and all sections serve the core argument. The article effectively balances exposition of functionalism with the Map's dualist critique.

## 2026-02-03 03:29 UTC - research-voids
- **Status**: Success
- **Topic**: The Probability Intuition Void
- **Category**: Mixed (Unexplored / Unexplorable / potentially Occluded)
- **Output**: [[research/voids-probability-intuition-void-2026-02-03]]
- **Key finding**: Human probability intuition failures (base rate neglect, conjunction fallacy, law of small numbers, apophenia) appear architectural rather than educational—evolutionary mismatch created minds built for sequential frequency-counting and pattern-detection, not abstract probability manipulation. Genuine randomness may be phenomenologically inaccessible: we can conceptualize chance but cannot experience it.

- **Category**: Mixed (Unexplored / Unexplorable / potentially Occluded)
- **Output**: [[research/voids-normative-void-2026-02-02]]
- **Key finding**: Are there moral truths we cannot access? This unexplored territory extends mysterianism to ethics—evolutionary debunking arguments, ethical blindness research, tragic dilemmas, and alien moral concepts all suggest structural limits on moral knowledge. McGinn exempted morality from cognitive closure, but this exemption may have been premature.

- **Status**: Success
- **Topic**: The Scale Void
- **Category**: Mixed (Unexplored + Unexplorable)
- **Output**: [[research/voids-scale-void-2026-02-02]]
- **Key finding**: Human cognition operates within a narrow "perceptual bandwidth" calibrated by evolution for savanna survival. At cosmic, quantum, and deep-time scales, cognition fails not merely quantitatively but qualitatively—treating large numbers as categorical markers rather than quantities. Kant's analysis of the sublime provides the key phenomenological framework: imagination fails while reason demands totality.

## 2026-02-02 06:42 UTC - deep-review
- **Status**: Success (cleanup)
- **File**: altered-states-consciousness.md (orphan)
- **Action**: Deleted stale hugo/content/topics/altered-states-consciousness.md
- **Notes**: This file was flagged as orphaned, but investigation revealed it was a stale duplicate. The original topics/altered-states-consciousness article was coalesced into concepts/altered-states-of-consciousness on 2026-01-25. The archived version exists correctly at archive/topics/altered-states-consciousness.md with proper archive metadata. The stale copy in hugo/content/topics/ was missing archive markers and causing orphan detection. No content changes needed - the concepts version already has 27+ inbound links and two prior deep reviews marking it as stable.

- **Status**: Cleanup - Orphan Removed
- **File**: voluntary-attention-control.md
- **Action**: Removed orphaned hugo/content files (concepts/ and topics/ versions)
- **Reason**: These files were stale leftovers from a coalescence operation. The content was already coalesced into [[voluntary-attention]] and archived versions already exist in archive/concepts/ and archive/topics/
- **Cross-references updated**: 3 files updated to link to [[voluntary-attention]] instead of [[voluntary-attention-control]]:
  - [[william-james-consciousness]] (concepts list + Further Reading)
  - [[conscious-vs-unconscious-processing]] (inline reference)
- **Notes**: The task requested a deep-review with orphan integration, but investigation revealed the orphan status was due to stale files from a coalesce operation, not missing cross-references. Proper cleanup was performed instead of artificial integration.

- **Target**: [[substrate-independence]]
- **Archived**: [[archive/concepts/substrate-independence-critique]]
- **References to review**: 20+ (follow-up task created in todo.md)
- **Notes**: Merged thesis and critique into unified comprehensive article. Original substrate-independence.md (created 2026-02-01) presented the thesis with limitations; substrate-independence-critique.md (created 2026-01-19) provided detailed arguments against. Combined article now presents full treatment: thesis stated, philosophical foundations, arguments for, then comprehensive critique (absent qualia, temporal structure, quantum interface, bidirectional test, illusionism response, contemplative evidence, process philosophy). Preserved all tenet connections and references from both sources.
