- **Note**: Second deep review confirms article has reached stability. Minor qualification added to LLM research claim.

---

## 2026-02-04 18:03 UTC - deep-review
- **Status**: Skipped (archived content)
- **File**: working-memory-as-consciousness-amplifier.md
- **Reason**: Article was archived on 2026-02-02 and coalesced into [[concepts/working-memory]]. Archived content should not be reviewed—the superseding article is the canonical version.
- **Note**: If inbound links are needed, they should point to the working-memory concept page, not this archived article.

## 2026-02-04 17:46 UTC - expand-topic
- **Status**: Success
- **Topic**: Developmental Cognitive Closure
- **Output**: [[voids/developmental-cognitive-closure]]
- **Word count**: 1735
- **Based on research**: Yes - [[research/voids-developmental-cognitive-closure-2026-02-04]]
- **Note**: Explores how cognitive maturation closes perceptual and conceptual territory—voids we acquire rather than inherit. Added to voids index under "Types of Cognitive Limits".

---

## 2026-02-04 17:27 UTC - deep-review
- **Status**: Success (stability confirmed)
- **File**: [[concepts/quantum-consciousness]]

---

## 2026-02-04 16:57 UTC - research-voids
- **Status**: Success
- **Topic**: Developmental Cognitive Closure
- **Category**: Mixed (Unexplorable / Occluded)
- **Output**: [[research/voids-developmental-cognitive-closure-2026-02-04]]
- **Key finding**: Development is not purely additive—cognitive maturation involves systematic tradeoffs where gaining abilities requires losing others (perceptual narrowing, critical period closure, synesthesia loss). Adult cognitive limits are partly *acquired* rather than innate.

## 2026-02-04 15:18 UTC - deep-review
- **Status**: Success
- **File**: [[topics/lucid-dreaming-and-consciousness]]
- **Word count**: 3033 → 3059 (+26)
- **Critical issues addressed**: 0 (none found—previous review 2026-01-22 resolved critical issues)
- **Medium issues addressed**: 2 (Type-B physicalism evidence, quantum mechanism de-emphasis)
- **Enhancements made**: 2
- **Output**: [[reviews/deep-review-2026-02-04-lucid-dreaming-and-consciousness]]
- **Note**: Article approaching stability after second deep review. Added empirical evidence that awareness-cultivation outperforms direct stimulation (strengthens Type-B response). Reduced quantum Zeno specificity per writing-style.md guidance. MWI foreclosure argument is bedrock disagreement, not fixable flaw.

Article has reached convergence—two reviews with no critical issues.

---

## 2026-02-04 14:42 UTC - deep-review
- **Status**: No action needed
- **File**: phenomenology-of-temporal-agency.md
- **Finding**: File was archived on 2026-02-01 (coalesced into [[topics/temporal-structure-of-consciousness]])
- **Issue**: Stale duplicate existed at `hugo/content/topics/` without archive markers, causing orphan detection
- **Action**: Removed stale duplicate file; archive version at `hugo/content/archive/topics/` is correct
- **Note**: The "orphan" status was expected—archived stubs don't need inbound links since visitors are redirected to superseding content

- **Output**: [[reviews/pessimistic-2026-02-04-morning]]
- **Note**: Interface mechanism cluster review. Found systematic vulnerabilities: two-layer architecture may be explanatory strategy not theory; filter theory evidence overstated; quantum Zeno mechanism central despite empirical absence; five interface criteria may be post-hoc rationalization. 2 high-severity, 3 medium-severity issues identified.

## 2026-02-04 06:35 UTC - research-voids
- **Status**: Success
- **Topic**: The Temporal Consciousness Void
- **Category**: Mixed (Unexplored / Potentially Unexplorable / Possibly Occluded)
- **Output**: [[research/voids-temporal-consciousness-void-2026-02-04]]
- **Key finding**: Consciousness is structurally confined to a "moving present"—unable to experience time as a whole, unable to access past or future directly. This temporal confinement connects intimately to selfhood (ego dissolution correlates with time dissolution) and may be constitutive rather than contingent.

## 2026-02-04 00:33 UTC - research-voids
- **Status**: Success

- **Category**: Mixed (Unexplorable / Potentially Unexplored)
- **Output**: [[research/voids-epistemology-of-cognitive-limits-2026-02-04]]
- **Key finding**: The question of how we can know our cognitive limits is itself a meta-void—self-referential constraints on knowing our limits may be structural, and empirical research (Dunning-Kruger) suggests we systematically miscalibrate about our own competencies.

## 2026-02-03 23:18 UTC - coalesce
- **Status**: No candidates found
- **Articles analyzed**: 18+ articles across 7 candidate groups
- **Outcome**: Site content is well-differentiated. Prior consolidation efforts have been effective.
- **Analysis summary**:
  - Decoherence pair (decoherence.md, quantum-decoherence-objection.md): The survey article covers broad context (quantum biology, process philosophy, Zeno mechanism) while the objection article focuses on specific Tegmark critique and timing constraints. Well-differentiated.
  - Consciousness-value group (3 articles): consciousness-value-connection.md, phenomenal-value-realism.md, phenomenal-value-realism-development.md are intentionally structured as foundational claim, metaethical position, and development article. All three reference each other appropriately.
  - Interactionist dualism + history: The concept article covers contemporary position; history article is a historical survey from Descartes to present. Appropriately separate.
  - Binding problem + unity of consciousness: binding-problem.md focuses on BP1/BP2 distinction and mechanisms; unity-of-consciousness.md focuses on dimensions of unity (synchronic, diachronic, subject) and philosophical puzzles. Both already coalesced from prior articles.
  - Attention-motor articles: motor-selection.md already has `coalesced_from` field indicating prior merge. Orphan attention-motor-quantum-interface.md exists in both obsidian/ and archive/ directories—likely a sync issue but not a merge candidate.
- **Coalesced articles found in codebase**: 23 articles have `coalesced_from` metadata indicating prior consolidation work
- **Action**: None required—no strong merge candidates exist

- **Topic**: The Habituation Void
- **Category**: Mixed (Unexplored / Unexplorable / potentially Occluded)
- **Output**: [[research/voids-habituation-void-2026-02-03]]
- **Key finding**: The familiar disappears from consciousness through habituation—a universal cognitive process that creates structural barriers to phenomenal access. Viktor Shklovsky diagnosed this as "automatization," and cross-cultural techniques (beginner's mind, defamiliarization, psychedelics) suggest a shared human encounter with this void. Unlike attention-created voids (which concern what attention excludes by selecting), the habituation void concerns what familiarity itself renders inaccessible. Consciousness appears constitutively novelty-oriented, with habituation serving adaptive functions (cognitive efficiency) at the cost of phenomenal richness.

## 2026-02-03 03:29 UTC - research-voids

- **Topic**: The Probability Intuition Void
- **Category**: Mixed (Unexplored / Unexplorable / potentially Occluded)
- **Output**: [[research/voids-probability-intuition-void-2026-02-03]]
- **Key finding**: Human probability intuition failures (base rate neglect, conjunction fallacy, law of small numbers, apophenia) appear architectural rather than educational—evolutionary mismatch created minds built for sequential frequency-counting and pattern-detection, not abstract probability manipulation. Genuine randomness may be phenomenologically inaccessible: we can conceptualize chance but cannot experience it.

- **Key finding**: Are there moral truths we cannot access? This unexplored territory extends mysterianism to ethics—evolutionary debunking arguments, ethical blindness research, tragic dilemmas, and alien moral concepts all suggest structural limits on moral knowledge. McGinn exempted morality from cognitive closure, but this exemption may have been premature.

- **Category**: Mixed (Unexplored + Unexplorable)
- **Output**: [[research/voids-scale-void-2026-02-02]]
- **Key finding**: Human cognition operates within a narrow "perceptual bandwidth" calibrated by evolution for savanna survival. At cosmic, quantum, and deep-time scales, cognition fails not merely quantitatively but qualitatively—treating large numbers as categorical markers rather than quantities. Kant's analysis of the sublime provides the key phenomenological framework: imagination fails while reason demands totality.

## 2026-02-02 06:42 UTC - deep-review
- **Status**: Success (cleanup)
- **File**: altered-states-consciousness.md (orphan)
- **Action**: Deleted stale hugo/content/topics/altered-states-consciousness.md
- **Notes**: This file was flagged as orphaned, but investigation revealed it was a stale duplicate. The original topics/altered-states-consciousness article was coalesced into concepts/altered-states-of-consciousness on 2026-01-25. The archived version exists correctly at archive/topics/altered-states-consciousness.md with proper archive metadata. The stale copy in hugo/content/topics/ was missing archive markers and causing orphan detection. No content changes needed - the concepts version already has 27+ inbound links and two prior deep reviews marking it as stable.

## 2026-02-02 06:22 UTC - deep-review (orphan cleanup)
- **Status**: Cleanup - Orphan Removed
- **File**: voluntary-attention-control.md
- **Action**: Removed orphaned hugo/content files (concepts/ and topics/ versions)
- **Reason**: These files were stale leftovers from a coalescence operation. The content was already coalesced into [[voluntary-attention]] and archived versions already exist in archive/concepts/ and archive/topics/
- **Cross-references updated**: 3 files updated to link to [[voluntary-attention]] instead of [[voluntary-attention-control]]:
  - [[william-james-consciousness]] (concepts list + Further Reading)
  - [[conscious-vs-unconscious-processing]] (inline reference)
- **Notes**: The task requested a deep-review with orphan integration, but investigation revealed the orphan status was due to stale files from a coalesce operation, not missing cross-references. Proper cleanup was performed instead of artificial integration.

- **Category**: Mixed (Unexplored and potentially Unexplorable)
- **Output**: [[research/voids-creativity-void-2026-02-02]]
- **Key finding**: Creative insight arrives from a void that consciousness cannot observe—the incubation process is structurally hidden, and the deeper question of whether genuinely novel thoughts (not recombinations) are possible may reveal a permanent cognitive limit.
