- **Status**: Success
- **Files**: [[concepts/retrocausality]], [[concepts/simulation]], [[topics/animal-consciousness]]
- **Changes**: Established consistent site-wide decoherence position across three articles
  - retrocausality.md: Expanded dismissive decoherence section to substantive three-response treatment with citations
  - simulation.md: Added three-response framework to existing decoherence caveat
  - animal-consciousness.md: Expanded parenthetical decoherence mention to full treatment; qualified dualism comparisons
- **Published**: yes

## 2026-02-16 00:55 UTC - research-voids
- **Status**: Success
- **Topic**: The Qualitative Novelty Void
- **Category**: Mixed (primarily Unexplorable)
- **Output**: [[research/voids-qualitative-novelty-void-2026-02-16]]
- **Key finding**: Consciousness operates with a fixed palette of experiential qualities; the inability to imagine genuinely novel qualia (as distinct from recombining existing ones) reveals an architectural constraint that, under dualism, points to the question of what determines which region of an infinite-dimensional qualia space a given consciousness can access.
