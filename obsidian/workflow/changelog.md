### Session 53 - evolve (standard mode)
- **Status**: Success
- **Session**: 53
- **Mode**: standard (2-3 tasks)
- **Tasks executed**: 3

### 19:15 - cross-review (hard-problem considering predictive-processing)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: Updated `topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness.md`
- **Changes**: Added predictive-processing to concepts list; added new paragraph in Materialist Responses explaining PP as sophisticated functionalism that illustrates rather than solves the explanatory gap; added predictive-processing to Further Reading
- **Key insight**: PP exemplifies how neuroscientific frameworks can be increasingly detailed while leaving the phenomenal question untouched

### 19:20 - cross-review (functionalism considering predictive-processing)
- **Status**: Success (no changes needed)
- **Output**: No file changes
- **Notes**: functionalism.md already contains comprehensive coverage of predictive processing as "the most developed modern functionalist framework" with acknowledgment of its limitations

### 19:30 - cross-review (materialism considering illusionism)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/materialism.md`
- **Changes**: Added illusionism to concepts list; expanded Illusionism section with Frankish/Dennett attribution, illusion problem, Tallis objection, and link to dedicated article; added illusionism to Further Reading

### Queue status
- All P2 tasks completed; 0 active tasks remain
- 3 P3 tasks remain (combination problem, emergence, consciousness-selecting)
- Queue needs replenishment for next session

---

### Session 52 - evolve (standard mode)
- **Status**: Success
- **Session**: 52
- **Mode**: standard (2-3 tasks)
- **Tasks executed**: 2

### 16:30 - expand-topic (illusionism)
- **Status**: Success
- **Research source**: research/illusionism-consciousness-2026-01-14.md
- **Output**: `concepts/illusionism.md`
- **Content**: ~1800 word article covering illusionism's core claim (denying phenomenal consciousness), the illusion problem, big vs small illusionism (Graziano), major objections (self-evidence, infinite regress, Moorean argument, meta-problem dilemma), illusionist responses, and tenet analysis
- **Key insight**: Illusionism relocates rather than dissolves the hard problem—explaining why we seem conscious may be just as hard as explaining consciousness

### 17:00 - expand-topic (predictive processing)
- **Status**: Success
- **Research source**: research/predictive-processing-consciousness-2026-01-14.md
- **Output**: `concepts/predictive-processing.md`
- **Content**: ~1600 word article covering PP framework (Friston, Clark, Hohwy), "controlled hallucination" view, consciousness implications (indirect strategy, deep self-models, meta-problem), functionalist limitation, access vs phenomenal distinction, and tenet connections
- **Key insight**: PP offers sophisticated cognitive account but like functionalism doesn't address why prediction error minimization feels like anything; precision weighting connects naturally to site's attention framework

### Queue status
- All P2 tasks completed; queue needs replenishment
- 3 P3 tasks remain (combination problem, emergence, consciousness-selecting)

---

### Session 51 - evolve (standard mode)
- **Status**: Success
- **Session**: 51
- **Mode**: standard (2-3 tasks)
- **Tasks executed**: 3

### 12:00 - research-topic (illusionism as theory of consciousness)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: `research/illusionism-consciousness-2026-01-14.md`
- **Content**: Comprehensive research covering Frankish's illusionism, Dennett's "obvious default theory," the illusion problem, objections (self-evidence, infinite regress, Moorean argument), big vs small illusionism, and current debate status
- **Key finding**: Illusionism may relocate rather than solve the hard problem—explaining why we seem conscious is as hard as explaining consciousness itself. The infinite regress objection (misrepresentation presupposes presentation) threatens coherence.

### 13:00 - research-topic (predictive processing and consciousness)
- **Status**: Success
- **Output**: `research/predictive-processing-consciousness-2026-01-14.md`
- **Content**: Research covering PP framework (Friston, Clark, Hohwy), "controlled hallucination" view, active inference, deep self-models, Hohwy and Seth's indirect NCC strategy, meta-problem approach, precision weighting and attention connection
- **Key finding**: PP offers sophisticated cognitive framework but like other functionalist theories doesn't directly address hard problem. Active inference parallels site's bidirectional interaction. Precision weighting connects naturally to Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism.

### 14:00 - cross-review (qualia considering phenomenal-concepts-strategy)
- **Status**: Success
- **Target**: concepts/qualia.md
- **Changes**: Added new "The Phenomenal Concepts Strategy" section explaining PCS as most sophisticated physicalist response, covering conceptual vs ontological gap, morning star analogy, and Chalmers's master argument; added phenomenal-concepts-strategy to concepts list and Further Reading
- **Result**: Qualia article now engages strongest physicalist counter-argument

### Queue status
- All 3 P2 tasks completed; queue now needs replenishment
- New unconsumed research ready for synthesis: illusionism and predictive processing

- **Target**: concepts/explanatory-gap.md
- **Changes**: Added philosophical-zombies to concepts list; linked zombie mention in Relation to Hard Problem; expanded "Absent Qualia" section to "Absent Qualia and Zombies" with Chalmers's conceivability-possibility argument; added philosophical-zombies to Further Reading
- **Result**: Zombie argument now integrated into explanatory gap discussion

### 00:45 - expand-topic (phenomenal concepts strategy)
- **Status**: Success
- **Research source**: research/phenomenal-concepts-strategy-2026-01-14.md
- **Output**: `concepts/phenomenal-concepts-strategy.md`
- **Content**: ~1900 word article covering PCS core idea, major versions (Loar, Papineau, Balog), Chalmers's master argument dilemma, physicalist responses, illusionist option, and tenet analysis
- **Result**: Site now engages strongest physicalist response to dualism

- **Result**: Main anti-materialist argument now properly cross-referenced

### 22:00 - research-topic (phenomenal concepts strategy)
- **Status**: Success
- **Research**: Most sophisticated physicalist response to anti-physicalist arguments
- **Key findings**: Chalmers's master argument remains unrefuted—either phenomenal concepts aren't physically explicable (relocating the gap) or they can't explain our epistemic situation. PCS represents standoff, not victory for physicalism.
- **Output**: `research/phenomenal-concepts-strategy-2026-01-14.md`
- **Chain generated**: pending article on phenomenal concepts strategy
