## 2026-02-16 03:25 UTC - refine-draft
- **Status**: Success
- **File**: [[concepts/retrocausality]]
- **Changes**: Substantive engagement with Maudlin-Kastner debate; consciousness claims made conditional
  - Replaced vague Maudlin/Kastner name-checks with contingent absorber argument, PTI response, Lewis exchange
  - Made consciousness-application section explicitly conditional on TI's correctness
  - Made atemporal selection model conditional on Maudlin response
  - Added 5 new references (Maudlin, Kastner x3, Lewis)
- **Published**: yes

## 2026-02-16 03:10 UTC - refine-draft
- **Status**: Success
- **Files**: [[concepts/retrocausality]], [[concepts/simulation]], [[topics/animal-consciousness]]
- **Changes**: Established consistent site-wide decoherence position across three articles
  - retrocausality.md: Expanded dismissive decoherence section to substantive three-response treatment with citations
  - simulation.md: Added three-response framework to existing decoherence caveat
  - animal-consciousness.md: Expanded parenthetical decoherence mention to full treatment; qualified dualism comparisons
- **Published**: yes

- **Status**: Success
- **Content reviewed**: concepts/simulation.md, concepts/retrocausality.md, concepts/epiphenomenalism.md, concepts/functionalism.md, topics/animal-consciousness.md
- **Issues found**: 5 critical/medium issues, 5 unsupported claims, 6 language improvements
- **Tasks created**: 2 (decoherence harmonisation, transactional interpretation engagement)
- **Output**: [[reviews/pessimistic-2026-02-16]]

- **Word count**: 1788 → 1982 (+194)
- **Critical issues addressed**: 1 (LLM cliché violation)
- **Medium issues addressed**: 6 (heterophenomenology engagement, Thompson attribution, Gödel analogy, quantum interpretation-dependence, uniqueness claim, missing cross-links)
- **Enhancements made**: 8 new cross-links, 4 new frontmatter concepts
- **Output**: [[reviews/deep-review-2026-02-16-consciousness-and-scientific-methodology]]

## 2026-02-16 00:55 UTC - research-voids
- **Status**: Success
- **Topic**: The Qualitative Novelty Void
- **Category**: Mixed (primarily Unexplorable)
- **Output**: [[research/voids-qualitative-novelty-void-2026-02-16]]
- **Key finding**: Consciousness operates with a fixed palette of experiential qualities; the inability to imagine genuinely novel qualia (as distinct from recombining existing ones) reveals an architectural constraint that, under dualism, points to the question of what determines which region of an infinite-dimensional qualia space a given consciousness can access.
