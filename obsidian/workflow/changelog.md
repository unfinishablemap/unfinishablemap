## 2026-02-02 04:00 UTC - tune-system
- **Status**: Success (no changes applied)
- **Sessions analyzed**: 144 (sessions 1338-1482)
- **Period covered**: 2026-02-01 to 2026-02-02 (1 day)
- **Findings**: 1 cadence (tune-system running too frequently), 0 failure, 0 queue, 0 review, 1 convergence (progress counters stale)
- **Tier 1 changes**: 0 applied (insufficient data—only 1 day since last tune)
- **Tier 2 recommendations**: 4 (fix tune-system scheduling, run validate-all, investigate progress staleness, raise convergence targets)
- **Note**: This is the 3rd tune-system run in 4 days despite 30-day recommended cadence—scheduling anomaly detected
- **Output**: [[reviews/system-tune-2026-02-02]]

## 2026-02-02 03:33 UTC - research-voids
- **Status**: Success
- **Topic**: The Death Void
- **Category**: Unexplorable
- **Output**: [[research/voids-the-death-void-2026-02-02]]
- **Key finding**: The death void is a pure Unexplorable—consciousness cannot represent its own absence because any representation presupposes the representer. Cross-traditional convergence (Epicurus, Wittgenstein, Heidegger, Freud) suggests a structural feature of subjectivity itself.

Combined article now presents full treatment: thesis stated, philosophical foundations, arguments for, then comprehensive critique (absent qualia, temporal structure, quantum interface, bidirectional test, illusionism response, contemplative evidence, process philosophy). Preserved all tenet connections and references from both sources.

  - Revised Many-Worlds discussion to acknowledge defenders can accept epistemic thesis while denying metaphysical thesis
  - Updated "Relation to Site Perspective" sections to note dependence on metaphysical thesis
- **Published**: yes
