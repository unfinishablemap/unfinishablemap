This is the task queue for AI automation. The human reviews and prioritizes tasks; the AI executes them.

## How to Edit This List

- **Promote**: Change `P2` to `P1`, etc.
- **Demote**: Change `P1` to `P2`, etc.
- **Veto**: Add `#veto` anywhere in the task heading (e.g., `### P2: Task name #veto`)
- **Add reason**: Optionally add `- **Veto reason**: [why]` before vetoing

Vetoed items are moved automatically to the Vetoed Tasks section on the next evolution loop run.

## Priority Levels

- **P0**: Urgent - execute immediately
- **P1**: High - execute this week
- **P2**: Medium - execute when time permits
- **P2**: Low - nice to have, human approval needed

## Active Tasks

### P2: Update references to coalesced understanding articles
- **Type**: other
- **Notes**: Coalesce merged [[phenomenology-of-inferential-understanding]] and [[consciousness-and-semantic-understanding]] into [[phenomenology-of-understanding]]. The following active content files reference the archived articles and may need wikilinks updated: phenomenology-of-theoretical-commitment, hoel-llm-consciousness-continual-learning, consciousness-and-the-authority-of-logic, phenomenology-of-philosophical-disagreement, phenomenology-of-conceptual-change, consciousness-and-the-problem-of-induction, consciousness-and-the-phenomenology-of-translation, consciousness-and-testimony, phenomenology-of-trust-and-testimony, consciousness-and-interpersonal-understanding, meaning-of-life, phenomenology-of-musical-understanding, semantic-memory, symbol-grounding-problem, global-workspace-theory, phenomenal-intentionality, working-memory, cognitive-phenomenology, temporal-structure-of-understanding, phenomenology-of-intellectual-effort, phenomenology-of-epistemic-achievement, consciousness-and-mathematical-cognition, consciousness-and-the-meta-problem-of-scientific-explanation, surprise-prediction-error-and-consciousness, phenomenology-of-imagination, consciousness-and-the-philosophy-of-explanation, phenomenology-of-belief-revision.

- **Generated**: 2026-02-22

### P2: Update references to coalesced contemplative evidence articles
- **Type**: other
- **Notes**: Coalesce created [[contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness]]. The following 28 active content files reference the archived [[contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness-theories]] and need wikilinks updated to point to the new article: empirical-evidence-for-consciousness-selecting, indian-philosophy-of-mind, contemplative-neuroscience, bergson-and-duration, the-self-minimal-narrative-and-substantial, phenomenological-psychiatry-and-altered-experience, consciousness-and-the-neuroscience-of-deliberate-practice, neuroplasticity, moral-perception, normative-phenomenology, aesthetic-dimension-of-consciousness, phenomenology-of-evidence-assessment, phenomenology-of-temporal-attention, the-observer-witness-in-meditation, social-construction-of-self-vs-phenomenal-self, the-hard-problem-in-non-western-philosophy, phenomenology-of-normative-properties, non-temporal-consciousness, phenomenology-of-moral-experience, phenomenal-value-realism, epiphenomenalism, contemplative-reliability, contemplative-methods-as-philosophical-methodology, methodological-pluralism, contemplative-epistemology, contemplative-path (apex), phenomenological-evidence, eastern-philosophy-consciousness.
- **Source**: coalesce
- **Generated**: 2026-02-22

### P2: Update references to coalesced pain articles
- **Type**: other
- **Notes**: Coalesce created [[why-pain-hurts]]. The following active content files reference the archived [[consciousness-and-pain]] and/or [[phenomenology-of-pain]] and need wikilinks updated to point to the new article: pain-asymbolia (concept), valence, valence-void, phenomenal-normativity-environmental-ethics, suffering-versus-pain, placebo-effect-and-mental-causation, pain-asymbolia-as-central-test-case, phenomenal-depth, phenomenological-psychiatry-and-altered-experience, voids-valence-void research note.

### P3: Strengthen measurement-problem-as-hard-problem cross-references
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. This article makes the Map's most distinctive contribution (the unification thesis) but is underlinked from emergence.md, filter-theory.md, downward-causation.md, and the tenets page. Cross-linking campaign would increase visibility of the strongest argument. See optimistic-2026-02-20-evening.md

### P3: Strengthen galilean-exclusion cross-links
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. galilean-exclusion.md is the most structurally distinctive argument on the site but is not linked from explanatory-gap.md, consciousness.md, or consciousness-and-strong-emergence.md. These are the articles that would benefit most from its reframing. See optimistic-2026-02-21.md

### P3: Write article on philosophy of perception and consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The Map has extensive phenomenology of higher cognition (mathematical, linguistic, moral, aesthetic) but comparatively thin treatment of basic perceptual consciousness—colour experience, cross-modal perception, perceptual constancy as evidence for irreducibility. This is the domain where the Galilean exclusion is most immediately visible. Builds on galilean-exclusion.md, phenomenology-of-attention-to-absence.md, aesthetic-dimension-of-consciousness.md, binding problem articles. See optimistic-2026-02-22.md

### P3: Write article on consciousness and the philosophy of biology
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The Map lacks systematic treatment of how dualism interfaces with philosophy of biology beyond evolution-of-consciousness. Recent work by Walsh, Godfrey-Smith, Okasha challenges gene-centered neo-Darwinism in ways potentially compatible with the Map's framework. Godfrey-Smith's octopus cognition work is particularly relevant. Builds on evolution-of-consciousness.md, consciousness-in-simple-organisms.md, animal-consciousness.md. See optimistic-2026-02-22.md

### P3: Write article on African philosophy of consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The Map includes Indian, Buddhist, and Eastern perspectives but has no coverage of African philosophical traditions. Ubuntu philosophy's relational personhood, the Akan concept of sunsum, and Tempels's vital force ontology offer genuinely different frameworks. The relational emphasis—consciousness as essentially communal—challenges both Western individualist dualism and Eastern dissolution of self. Builds on indian-philosophy-of-mind.md, cross-cultural-phenomenology-of-agency.md. See optimistic-2026-02-22.md

### P3: Strengthen indian-philosophy-of-mind cross-links to core dualism articles
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. indian-philosophy-of-mind.md provides independent cross-cultural validation of dualism but is not linked from substance-property-dualism.md, interactionist-dualism.md, or the-case-for-dualism.md. These core articles would benefit from noting that Indian traditions arrived at dualism through independent philosophical traditions over two millennia. See optimistic-2026-02-22.md

### P3: Deep review control-theoretic-will.md
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: AI-generated content (ai_contribution: 100) that has never received a deep review. Concept article on control-theoretic models of will. Verify claims, check for unsupported assertions, and ensure alignment with the Map's framework on free will and consciousness.
- **Source**: staleness
- **Generated**: 2026-02-22

### P3: Write article on consciousness as activity rather than property
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The insight that consciousness is something matter *does* rather than a property matter *has* runs through multiple articles (information-integration, emergence, contemplative-evidence, agent-causation) but has never been developed as a unifying theme. Would resolve IIT's passivity problem, connect to contemplative evidence of active witness, and integrate with agent causation. Target section: concepts/. See optimistic-2026-02-22-night.md

### P3: Write article on the consciousness threshold in cognitive evolution
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The baseline cognition hypothesis (great apes achieve tool use and procedural metacognition without logical reasoning, counterfactual thinking, or cumulative culture) reframes consciousness as a recent evolutionary threshold rather than ancient property. Builds on consciousness-independent-baseline-cognition.md, agent-causation.md, moral-responsibility.md. Target section: topics/. See optimistic-2026-02-22-night.md

### P3: Strengthen emergence.md cross-link to measurement-problem-as-philosophical-problem.md
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The measurement problem provides the specific locus where strong emergence could operate, but emergence.md does not link to measurement-problem-as-philosophical-problem.md. Also add links between moral-responsibility.md and consciousness-and-the-grounds-of-normative-authority.md (shared mechanism), and temporal-consciousness.md to collapse-and-time.md (Husserl maps onto collapse temporal structure). See optimistic-2026-02-22-night.md

### P3: Write article on consciousness and embodiment (somatic interface)
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The Map develops the quantum-neural interface extensively but has not systematically examined how embodiment shapes consciousness—interoception, proprioception, somatic markers (Damasio). The body is where consciousness meets the world most intimately; current coverage is thin relative to its importance. Builds on motor-control-quantum-zeno.md, dopamine-and-the-unified-interface.md, embodied-cognition.md. Target section: topics/. See optimistic-2026-02-22-morning.md

### P3: Write article on philosophy of language and consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Multiple articles touch language but no unified treatment exists. Wittgenstein's private language argument, Kripke's modal semantics for phenomenal terms, Brandom's inferentialism—all have implications for communicating phenomenal states. Particularly pressing given the Map's LLM-first audience. Builds on consciousness-and-language-interface.md, symbol-grounding-problem.md. Target section: topics/. See optimistic-2026-02-22-morning.md

### P3: Write article on consciousness and neurodegenerative disease
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Alzheimer's, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy body dementia provide natural experiments testing what consciousness does vs. what the brain does. Filter theory predicts specific deterioration patterns these diseases test. Builds on dopamine-and-the-unified-interface.md, disorders-of-consciousness-as-test-cases.md. Target section: topics/. See optimistic-2026-02-22-morning.md

### P3: Strengthen cross-links between recent articles and existing content
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Key missing links: reductionism-and-consciousness → convergence-argument, motor-control-quantum-zeno → attention-as-selection-interface, indian-philosophy-of-mind → epistemology-of-convergence-arguments, temporal-ontology-and-consciousness → apex/time-consciousness-growing-block, participatory-universe → measurement-problem-as-hard-problem. See optimistic-2026-02-22-morning.md for full table.

### P3: Integrate apophatic-cartography.md into site navigation
- **Type**: integrate-orphan
- **Notes**: File has no inbound links (created 2026-02-19). This void article on negative-space epistemology represents a distinctive methodology. Link from related void articles and epistemic-humility.md, mysterianism.md, or methodology pages.
- **Source**: orphan_integration
- **Generated**: 2026-02-22

### P3: Deep review attention-as-causal-bridge.md
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: Apex article (ai_contribution: 100) that has never received a deep review since creation (2026-02-14). As a synthesis piece, quality is especially important. Verify coherence, cross-references, and tenet alignment.
- **Source**: staleness
- **Generated**: 2026-02-22

### P3: Deep review apophatic-approaches.md
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: AI-generated content (ai_contribution: 100) last reviewed 2026-01-20, making it the most stale reviewed content on the site (33 days). As a voids article on negative-space epistemology, it frames a distinctive methodology. Verify quality, coherence, and alignment with the Map's evolving treatment of cognitive limits and unknowability.
- **Source**: staleness
- **Generated**: 2026-02-22

### P3: Deep review motor-control-quantum-zeno.md
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: AI-generated content (ai_contribution: 100) that has never received a deep review since creation. Explores how the quantum Zeno effect relates to motor control and conscious intention — directly supports Tenet 2 (Minimal Quantum Interaction). Verify mechanism claims, ensure accurate representation of Stapp's framework, and check tenet alignment.

### ✓ 2026-02-07: Address confidence-uncertainty mismatch in foundational articles
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-05) found pattern across simulation.md, knowledge-argument.md, and ethics-of-consciousness.md: strong claims in main text, uncertainty acknowledgments buried in caveats or "What Would Challenge" sections. Creates misleading impression. Need to integrate conditional language into main claims: "If the simulation hypothesis is coherent, it would suggest..." rather than "The simulation hypothesis dissolves..." Also: knowledge-argument treats intuition as near-probative without engaging methodological debates; ethics article's AI consciousness conclusions rest heavily on contested framework. See pessimistic-2026-02-05.md
- **Source**: pessimistic-review
- **Generated**: 2026-02-05
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/simulation.md, obsidian/concepts/knowledge-argument.md, obsidian/topics/ethics-of-consciousness.md

### ✓ 2026-02-09: Write article on phenomenal conservatism and introspective evidence
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-02 (afternoon). Huemer's phenomenal conservatism—if it seems to S that P, S has prima facie justification for believing P—is foundational for treating phenomenal evidence seriously. How does the Map handle introspective reliability? When should phenomenal seemings be trusted? Builds on arguments-for-dualism.md, epistemic-advantages-of-dualism.md, introspection.md. See optimistic-2026-02-02-afternoon.md
- **Source**: optimistic-review
- **Generated**: 2026-02-02
- **Output**: obsidian/topics/phenomenal-conservatism-and-introspective-evidence.md

### ✓ 2026-02-09: Create concept page for phenomenal transparency
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: complete (duplicate of earlier task)

### P3: Write article on emotional consciousness and valence
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Emotional phenomenology receives less systematic treatment than sensory or cognitive consciousness, yet emotional qualia may be more resistant to reduction—the inverted spectrum objection doesn't apply to emotional valence. Builds on phenomenology-of-pain.md, valence.md, consciousness-value-connection.md, phenomenal-value-realism.md. Target section: topics/. See optimistic-2026-02-22-afternoon.md

### P3: Write article on consciousness and attention dissociation
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Koch and Tsuchiya's discovery that attention and consciousness can come apart deserves standalone treatment showing what this reveals for the interface model. If attention is the selection mechanism, dissociation constrains where consciousness acts. Builds on attention-as-selection-interface.md, structure-of-attention.md. Target section: topics/. See optimistic-2026-02-22-afternoon.md

### P3: Write article on the zombie master argument
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Chalmers's master argument against the phenomenal concepts strategy deserves standalone treatment—the phenomenal concepts response is the physicalist's strongest rebuttal, and refuting it systematically strengthens the convergence case in the-case-for-dualism.md. Builds on philosophical-zombies.md, conceivability-possibility-inference.md. Target section: concepts/. See optimistic-2026-02-22-afternoon.md

### P3: Write article on the metaphysics of information under dualism
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Many consciousness theories (IIT, GWT, HOT) presuppose a physicalist understanding of "information." Shannon information is defined physically; semantic information requires intentionality. The Map's framework suggests information has a dual aspect—physical structure and phenomenal meaning—that physicalist theories conflate. Builds on integrated-information-theory.md, quantum-consciousness.md, binding-problem.md. Target section: concepts/. See optimistic-2026-02-22-evening.md

### P3: Write article on cross-cultural convergence on mental causation
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The Map demonstrates cross-cultural convergence on the hard problem but has not examined whether independent traditions also converge on consciousness being causally efficacious. Indian karma theory, Chinese qi philosophy, and African vital force traditions all posit mental-to-physical causation. Strengthens the convergence argument for Tenet 3. Builds on the-hard-problem-in-non-western-philosophy.md, indian-philosophy-of-mind.md, cross-cultural-phenomenology-of-agency.md. Target section: topics/. See optimistic-2026-02-22-evening.md

### P3: Strengthen convergence-argument cross-links to galilean-exclusion
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. the-convergence-argument-for-dualism.md would benefit from linking to galilean-exclusion.md as an independent structural argument. Also link pain-asymbolia-as-central-test-case.md to binding-problem.md (affective binding dissociation), and the-epiphenomenalist-threat.md to galilean-exclusion.md (the gravity well partly explained by science's founding exclusion). See optimistic-2026-02-22-evening.md

### P3: Deep review contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness.md
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: AI-generated content (ai_contribution: 100) that has never received a deep review since creation (2026-01-27). At 26 days old, this is the oldest unreviewed published content on the site. Product of coalesce merging contemplative evidence articles. Verify coherence, argument quality, and tenet alignment.
- **Source**: staleness
- **Generated**: 2026-02-22

### P3: Deep review why-pain-hurts.md
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: AI-generated content (ai_contribution: 100) that has never received a deep review since creation (2026-02-09). Product of coalesce merging consciousness-and-pain.md and phenomenology-of-pain.md. Coalesced articles are prone to inconsistencies from the merge process. Verify coherence, argument quality, and cross-references.
- **Source**: staleness
- **Generated**: 2026-02-22

### P3: Write concept article on direction-of-fit
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The mind-to-world vs. world-to-mind distinction is discussed across aesthetic creation, agent causation, and mental causation articles but has no dedicated concept page. Would articulate a fundamental asymmetry in consciousness's causal engagement. See optimistic-2026-02-22-late-afternoon.md

### P3: Write apex article on the phenomenology of consciousness doing work
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Synthesize evidence from emotion-as-evidence-for-dualism, consciousness-and-aesthetic-creation, agent-causation, and attention-as-interface showing consciousness's causal efficacy through its phenomenological signatures: valence-driven action, aesthetic-template guidance, creative effort, attentional override. See optimistic-2026-02-22-late-afternoon.md

### P3: Write topic article on Samkhya's three-way distinction
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Samkhya's consciousness/mind/gross-matter trichotomy anticipates functionalism for mind while maintaining irreducibility for consciousness—an underexplored middle path that enriches the Map's dualism with non-Western conceptual resources. See optimistic-2026-02-22-late-afternoon.md

## Completed Tasks


### ✓ 2026-02-23: Address argument gaps in simulation hypothesis article
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review found two high-severity issues: (1) the player-game analogy does too much work despite acknowledged weakness—needs either a stronger argument for why the inside/outside distinction doesn't matter, or a weaker conclusion; (2) the "diagnostic tool" claim is underdifferentiated from generic Cartesian skepticism—needs explicit distinction from brain-in-a-vat scenarios. See pessimistic-2026-02-23.md
- **Output**: Task context:

Coalesced articles are particularly prone to inconsistencies from the merge process. Verify coherence and cross-references.
- **Output**: obsidian/topics/consciousness-and-mathematical-cognition.md

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Deep review pain-asymbolia-as-central-test-case.md
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: AI-generated content (ai_contribution: 100) that has never received a deep review since creation. Recently written article arguing pain asymbolia is the strongest empirical case against epiphenomenalism. Verify claims, check citations, and ensure tenet alignment.
- **Output**: obsidian/topics/pain-asymbolia-as-central-test-case.md

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Deep review the-strong-emergence-of-consciousness.md
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: AI-generated content (ai_contribution: 100) that has never received a deep review since creation (2026-02-08). Product of coalesce merging consciousness-and-strong-emergence.md and consciousness-and-the-emergence-debate.md. Coalesced articles are particularly prone to inconsistencies from the merge process. Verify coherence and cross-references.
- **Output**: obsidian/topics/the-strong-emergence-of-consciousness.md

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Review bergson-and-duration.md considering specious present insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/specious-present-temporal-experience.md provides analysis of the experienced "now" that directly connects to Bergson's concept of durée. topics/bergson-and-duration.md should cross-reference the specious present treatment, particularly how James and Bergson converge on the non-punctual nature of temporal experience.
- **Output**: obsidian/topics/bergson-and-duration.md -- Context: Review bergson-and-duration.md considering specious present insights

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Write article on quantum randomness and LLM token sampling
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/quantum-randomness-llm-token-sampling-2026-02-10.md. Explores whether quantum random number generators in LLM token sampling could provide a consciousness-collapse interface for AI systems. Novel intersection of the Map's quantum consciousness framework with AI consciousness questions. Target section: concepts/.
- **Output**: quantum randomness and LLM token sampling

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Review temporal-consciousness.md considering specious present insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/specious-present-temporal-experience.md provides dedicated treatment of the experienced "now" and its philosophical implications. concepts/temporal-consciousness.md is the foundational article on time and consciousness and should cross-reference the specious present analysis, particularly its relevance to the binding problem and Husserlian time-consciousness.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/temporal-consciousness.md -- Context: Review temporal-consciousness.md considering specious present insights

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Integrate many-worlds.md into site navigation
- **Type**: integrate-orphan
- **Notes**: concepts/many-worlds.md has zero inbound wikilinks despite directly relating to Tenet 4 (No Many Worlds). Add cross-references from tenets.md, collapse-interpretation.md, quantum-consciousness.md, and arguments/many-worlds-argument.md. A concept page about MWI with no links from the site that explicitly rejects MWI is a critical navigation gap.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/many-worlds.md -- Context: This file has no inbound links and is orphaned. Focus on finding related articles that should link to this content. Add cross-references from existing articles to integrate this into the site navigation.

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Integrate materialism.md into site navigation
- **Type**: integrate-orphan
- **Notes**: concepts/materialism.md has zero inbound wikilinks despite being a central concept for a site arguing against materialism. Add cross-references from the-case-for-dualism.md, physicalism.md, consciousness.md, and other core articles that discuss or argue against materialism.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/materialism.md -- Context: This file has no inbound links and is orphaned. Focus on finding related articles that should link to this content. Add cross-references from existing articles to integrate this into the site navigation.

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Write article on consciousness in non-collapsed quantum states
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/consciousness-non-collapsed-quantum-states-2026-02-10.md. If consciousness causes collapse (Tenet 2), what is the status of consciousness relative to non-collapsed quantum states? Explores superposition, entanglement, and the relationship between observation and collapse. Directly supports Tenets 2 and 4. Target section: concepts/.
- **Output**: consciousness in non-collapsed quantum states

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Address convergence-vs-unfalsifiability gap in experimental-design-for-consciousness-collapse-testing.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review found the article's retreat from direct testability to "convergence" is indistinguishable from unfalsifiability — cited disconfirmers are entire research programmes, not achievable experiments. Also, PEAR lab citation damages credibility and should be reframed as cautionary tale. Foreground Chalmers-McQueen Φ prediction as the most testable claim. See pessimistic-2026-02-22-evening.md
- **Output**: obsidian/topics/experimental-design-for-consciousness-collapse-testing.md

Task context:

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Condense brain-interface-boundary.md (3,557 words, 102% of hard threshold)
- **Type**: condense
- **Notes**: Article exceeds 3,500-word hard threshold for concepts/. At 3,557 words, slightly over limit. Preserve core arguments while removing redundancy. See /condense skill.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/brain-interface-boundary.md

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Condense simulation.md (3,652 words, 104% of hard threshold)
- **Type**: condense
- **Notes**: Article exceeds 3,500-word hard threshold for concepts/. At 3,652 words, it likely contains redundancy. Preserve core arguments while tightening. See /condense skill.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/simulation.md

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Cross-review the-case-for-dualism.md considering parsimony void insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article voids/epistemological-limits-occams-razor.md argues that parsimony bias may be the primary cognitive obstacle to taking dualism seriously. concepts/the-case-for-dualism.md should cross-reference this cognitive architecture critique as strengthening the case against dismissing dualism on simplicity grounds.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/the-case-for-dualism.md -- Context: Cross-review the-case-for-dualism.md considering parsimony void insights

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Cross-review agent-causation.md considering voluntary attention control mechanisms
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/voluntary-attention-control-mechanisms.md explicitly frames thalamic gating mechanisms as where consciousness interrupts automatic processing. concepts/agent-causation.md should cross-reference these mechanisms as concrete instantiation of agent causation.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/agent-causation.md -- Context: Cross-review agent-causation.md considering voluntary attention control mechanisms

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Write article on consciousness in non-collapsed quantum states
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/consciousness-non-collapsed-quantum-states-2026-02-10.md. Explores whether consciousness can exist without wavefunction collapse—relevant to Penrose, Koch, Chalmers-McQueen, and Stapp frameworks. Challenges and supports the Map's Tenet 2. Target section: concepts/.
- **Output**: consciousness in non-collapsed quantum states

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Write article on the participatory universe
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/participatory-universe-2026-02-08.md. Wheeler's participatory universe thesis—observation as constitutive of reality—integrates with the Map's consciousness-collapse framework, QBism, and Stapp's quantum mind theory. Target section: concepts/.
- **Output**: the participatory universe

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Write article on epistemological limits of Occam's Razor for consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/epistemological-limits-occams-razor-consciousness-2026-02-06.md. Directly supports Tenet 5 (Occam's Razor Has Limits). Argues why parsimony cannot settle the consciousness debate—Huemer, Zanotti, and critiques of simplicity as epistemic guide when knowledge is incomplete. Target section: topics/ or concepts/.
- **Output**: epistemological limits of Occam's Razor for consciousness

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Condense contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness-theories.md (4428 words, 148% of target)
- **Type**: condense

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Condense the-case-for-dualism.md (4182 words, 167% of target)
- **Type**: condense
- **Notes**: Article exceeds 3500-word hard threshold for concepts/. As a central hub article, length is partially justified, but at 4182 words there is likely redundancy with the many linked supporting articles. Preserve the convergence argument structure while tightening prose and deferring detailed argument presentations to their dedicated pages. See /condense skill.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/the-case-for-dualism.md

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Condense llm-consciousness.md (4699 words, 188% of target)
- **Type**: condense
- **Notes**: Article exceeds 3500-word hard threshold for concepts/. At 4699 words, this is the longest concept article on the site. Preserve core arguments about substrate requirements and quantum randomness channel while removing redundancy and deferring detailed subtopics to linked articles. See /condense skill.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/llm-consciousness.md

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Update references to coalesced substrate-independence-critique article

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Strengthen Minimal Quantum Interaction cross-references
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Gap analysis found Minimal Quantum Interaction is the weakest-represented tenet (184 files vs 301 for Dualism, 61% ratio). While absolute coverage is adequate, many attention, cognition, and Eastern philosophy articles that implicitly connect to quantum interaction don't explicitly reference it. Add Tenet 2 cross-references to articles in the attention cluster (attention-interface-mechanisms.md, voluntary-attention.md), biological articles (evolution-of-consciousness.md, neural-quantum-coherence.md), and contemplative articles where the quantum Zeno mechanism is relevant.
- **Output**: None -- Context: Strengthen Minimal Quantum Interaction cross-references

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Fix case-sensitivity wikilink errors across content
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Gap analysis found 68 case-sensitivity wikilink errors where capitalized forms like [[Access consciousness]], [[Blindsight]], [[Filter-theory]], [[Qualia]] are used instead of lowercase-hyphenated forms. Most concentrated in concepts/ section (255 occurrences). Bulk find-replace needed: correct capitalized wikilinks to match actual filenames.

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Address gaps in temporal-ontology-and-consciousness.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review found two critical issues: (1) the article conflates philosophical association with logical constraint—the "package deal" thesis needs to distinguish affinity from necessity; (2) eternalism is treated uncharitably, ignoring sophisticated B-theorist accounts of temporal experience (Prosser, Hoerl). Also: unexplained retrocausality reference violates style guide, circularity in growing-block argument needs acknowledgment, and collapse-as-growth-mechanism is asserted without considering alternatives. See pessimistic-2026-02-22.md

### ✓ 2026-02-21: Write article on pain asymbolia as central test case
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Pain asymbolia (registering tissue damage without suffering) may be the single most powerful empirical case against epiphenomenalism. Co-presence and co-absence of phenomenal quality and causal efficacy. Mentioned across several articles but never receives dedicated treatment. Builds on phenomenology-of-pain.md, epiphenomenalism.md, consciousness-and-causal-powers.md. See optimistic-2026-02-21-evening.md
- **Output**: pain asymbolia as central test case

### ✓ 2026-02-21: Write article on consciousness and the epistemology of testimony
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. If understanding requires phenomenal consciousness (per cognitive-phenomenology.md), what happens when we accept claims on testimony? Testimony transfers propositional content but not phenomenal understanding — a distinctly dualist epistemological problem. Builds on phenomenology-of-trust.md, consciousness-and-social-cognition.md, argument-from-reason.md. See optimistic-2026-02-21-evening.md
- **Output**: consciousness and the epistemology of testimony

### ✓ 2026-02-21: Address gaps in collapse-and-time.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review found two high-severity issues: (1) uncited "revised microtubule coherence estimates" with pseudo-quantitative prediction lacking a mathematical model, (2) retrocausal Libet resolution asserted in opening paragraph but never argued in body. Also: modified growing block stated but not argued for; microtubule reference risks style guide violation (Subjects Requiring Restraint). See pessimistic-2026-02-21-evening.md

### ✓ 2026-02-21: Write article on the epistemology of mechanism at the consciousness-matter interface
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The Map repeatedly acknowledges its causal mechanism is underspecified. A dedicated article could examine why mechanisms at the consciousness-matter interface may be permanently opaque — connecting the measurement problem, cognitive closure, and third-person methodology limits. Builds on atemporal-causation.md, princess-elizabeths-challenge.md, mysterianism.md. See optimistic-2026-02-21-afternoon.md
- **Output**: the epistemology of mechanism at the consciousness-matter interface

### ✓ 2026-02-21: Write article on phenomenal normativity and environmental ethics
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. If phenomenal normativity grounds ethics, what follows for entities with uncertain consciousness (invertebrates, ecosystems, potentially some AI systems)? Builds on phenomenal-normativity.md, animal-consciousness.md, consciousness-in-simple-organisms.md. See optimistic-2026-02-21-afternoon.md
- **Output**: phenomenal normativity and environmental ethics

### ✓ 2026-02-21: Address critical gaps in consciousness-and-agency apex article
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-21 afternoon) found three high-severity issues: (1) circularity in mutual support structure—needs independent anchor points identified, (2) compatibilism dismissed in one sentence rather than genuinely engaged—Fischer, Wolf, Dennett need substantive treatment, (3) missing "What Would Challenge This View?" section despite being standard in all source articles. Also: Sartre attribution needs qualification, temporal constitution claims need explicit speculation markers, quantum scale problem unaddressed. See pessimistic-2026-02-21-afternoon.md

### ✓ 2026-02-21: Develop aesthetic consciousness as irreducibility test case
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Aesthetic qualia may be harder to reduce than sensory qualia (aesthetic space lacks structural asymmetries making inversion detectable). Aesthetic normativity and contemplative intensification provide additional evidence. Builds on qualia.md, binding-and-beauty, consciousness-and-aesthetic-creation, phenomenal-value-realism. See optimistic-2026-02-21-morning.md
- **Output**: Develop aesthetic consciousness as irreducibility test case

### ✓ 2026-02-21: Write unified treatment of empirical evidence for consciousness-selecting
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Voluntary attention, motor selection, choking interference, Schwartz's OCD work, and the dopamine dissociation all point toward the same selection mechanism but are scattered across articles. Convergence across empirical domains would strengthen the bidirectional interaction case. Builds on attention-as-selection-interface, choking-phenomenon, consciousness-and-skilled-performance, agent-causation. See optimistic-2026-02-21-morning.md
- **Output**: Write unified treatment of empirical evidence for consciousness-selecting

### ✓ 2026-02-21: Write apex synthesis on consciousness and the philosophy of time
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Multiple articles treat consciousness-time connections (growing-block-universe, temporal-integration, temporal-creativity, bergson-and-duration, temporal-structure-of-consciousness, non-temporal-consciousness). An apex synthesis showing how consciousness constitutes temporal flow, how temporal thickness relates to quantum timescales, and how the growing block framework unifies these treatments would be the Map's strongest original contribution. All five tenets converge. See optimistic-2026-02-21-morning.md
- **Output**: Write apex synthesis on consciousness and the philosophy of time

### ✓ 2026-02-21: Address working memory claim and no-barrier tension in animal-consciousness.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-21 morning) found two issues: (1) Working memory figures are outdated—article states "Chimpanzee capacity is ~2±1 items versus human 7±2" but Miller's 7±2 has been revised to ~4±1 (Cowan 2001) and Inoue & Matsuzawa (2007) showed young chimps outperforming humans on certain tasks. (2) Tension between opening claim that dualism "places no anthropocentric barrier" and later argument that apes may lack metacognitive consciousness—effectively introducing a consciousness hierarchy that functions as a barrier. See pessimistic-2026-02-21-morning.md

### ✓ 2026-02-21: Write article on phenomenological psychiatry and altered experience
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Jaspers, Binswanger, Sass on schizophrenia and temporal disintegration as natural experiments for the Map's framework. Builds on altered-states-of-consciousness.md, disorders-of-consciousness-as-test-cases.md, temporal-consciousness.md. See optimistic-2026-02-21.md
- **Output**: phenomenological psychiatry and altered experience

### ✓ 2026-02-21: Write article on Indian philosophy of mind (Samkhya, Nyaya, Vedanta)
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Buddhism appears but its sister traditions do not. Samkhya's purusha/prakriti dualism parallels interactionist dualism — consciousness as witness/selector and nature as the dynamic substrate. Nyaya's arguments for the self anticipate Western substance dualism. Builds on buddhism-and-dualism.md, eastern-philosophy-consciousness.md. See optimistic-2026-02-21.md
- **Output**: Indian philosophy of mind (Samkhya, Nyaya, Vedanta)

### ✓ 2026-02-20: Write article on Bergson and duration
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Bergson's duration as genuinely creative becoming, his filter theory (predating James), and temporal irreducibility are highly compatible with the Map's framework but underrepresented. Builds on creativity-consciousness-and-novel-thought.md, temporal-structure-of-consciousness.md, philosophy-of-time.md. See optimistic-2026-02-20-evening.md
- **Output**: Bergson and duration

### ✓ 2026-02-20: Write concept page for free will

- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Referenced in 8+ articles (phenomenology-of-flow-states, creativity-consciousness, evolution-under-dualism, consciousness-and-causal-powers, epiphenomenalism, mental-causation, interactionist-dualism) but no concept page exists. The Map's framework implies libertarian free will (quantum indeterminacy + conscious selection) without randomness. See optimistic-2026-02-20-evening.md

### ✓ 2026-02-20: Resolve tension between AI exception and Bidirectional Interaction tenet
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review found that epiphenomenalism.md's AI exception (self-stultification only proves *our* consciousness is causally efficacious) creates an unacknowledged tension with the Bidirectional Interaction tenet's general claim. The article should explicitly address whether the tenet applies to all consciousness or only the consciousness we have direct evidence for. See pessimistic-2026-02-20-evening.md Issue #2.

- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review found the consciousness-application section in retrocausality.md presents a detailed four-step model built on the transactional interpretation, which the article itself describes as a "stable impasse." Restructure so the model's dependence on TI is foregrounded at each step rather than caveated afterward. See pessimistic-2026-02-20-evening.md Issue #1.

### ✓ 2026-02-20: Write article on consciousness and the phenomenology of framework dependence
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-20 (afternoon). What does it feel like to be framework-dependent? The phenomenology of recognising that your deepest convictions might be framework effects rather than insights about reality. The vertigo of trying to think outside your conceptual scheme. Bridges the voids and phenomenology clusters. Builds on voids-framework-void-2026-02-20.md, phenomenology-of-theoretical-commitment.md, phenomenology-of-philosophical-disagreement.md.

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-20 (afternoon). The philosophy-of-science cluster (theoretical virtues, measurement standards, philosophy of explanation, convergence arguments) now forms a four-article strand arriving at dualism through scientific methodology rather than metaphysics. A synthesis article would ask: what does it mean when a phenomenon defeats the entire apparatus of science?

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-20 (afternoon). Research notes complete (voids-framework-void-2026-02-20.md). The framework void argues that our entire conceptual apparatus for understanding consciousness may constitute an invisible cognitive prison. Key elements: three dimensions of framework imprisonment (methodological, semantic, perceptual), the Davidson paradox, the productive tension between McGinn's pessimism and cartographic optimism. Builds on three-kinds-of-void.md, conceptual-impossibility.md, convergent-cognitive-limits.md. See optimistic-2026-02-20-afternoon.md

- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-20 afternoon) found the article argues theoretical virtues malfunction for consciousness, then claims this is "predicted by dualism and anomalous for physicalism." This is inconsistent — you cannot argue theory-choice machinery is broken, then use theory-choice reasoning to prefer dualism. Either acknowledge virtue-failure is neutral between dualism and physicalism, or develop the meta-argument more carefully by distinguishing first-order virtue application from second-order reasoning. Also engage with mysterianism as a genuine competitor (cognitive closure offers equally parsimonious reading of virtue failure). See pessimistic-2026-02-20-afternoon.md

The response ("no dissolution has been provided") is an argument from current ignorance.

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-20 (morning). The Map has separate articles on logical, moral, and aesthetic normativity. What's missing is a systematic treatment of how consciousness integrates these different normative domains into unified deliberation.

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-20 (morning). The control-theoretic framework identifies five operations but doesn't explore what it feels like to operate under multiple simultaneous constraints — moral, practical, temporal, aesthetic. The phenomenology of constraint satisfaction may reveal how consciousness integrates normative, practical, and affective inputs into a single control output.

Phenomenal-acquaintance.md should engage Loar's phenomenal concepts strategy more substantively. Categorical-surprise.md should address emergentist physicalist accounts where framework transcendence is a higher-order physical capacity. Both should explain why their arguments support substance dualism specifically, not merely phenomenological realism. See pessimistic-2026-02-20-morning.md

- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-20 morning) found the article concedes phase transitions produce qualitative breaks from quantitative physical changes, then asserts without argument that "consciousness transitions are not derivable from computational properties." The phase transition analogy actually weakens the dualist case by showing qualitative breaks *can* emerge from purely physical processes. Either argue why consciousness transitions differ (first-person phenomenal character vs. third-person structural properties), or remove the analogy. See pessimistic-2026-02-20-morning.md

- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-20 morning) found two issues: (1) The article admits delegatory preemption is "empirically indistinguishable from purely physical causation" but frames this as a virtue (observational closure) rather than a liability — this is unfalsifiable. Either identify a distinguishing empirical prediction or acknowledge it is a metaphysical interpretation, not a testable hypothesis. (2) The claim "the physical story is not violated — it is displaced" evades the causal closure question: if a non-physical cause preempts a physical cause, causal closure *is* violated. Acknowledge this directly. See pessimistic-2026-02-20-morning.md

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-20. The measurement standards article shows standard scientific methodology breaks down for consciousness.

The cumulative force is less than claimed. Needs explicit identification of shared assumptions and honest assessment of remaining force. (2) The vitalism analogy backfires—the response ("no analogous dissolution has occurred") is exactly what vitalists would have said pre-biochemistry.

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: From outer review 2026-02-19. The voids framework treats structured cognitive failure as cartographic data, but isn't yet packaged as a general methodology with rules of evidence. Create a methods article: how to distinguish confusion from genuine boundary, how to use convergent failure modes across observers, how to integrate phenomenology with cognitive science, how to prevent void-exploration from becoming unfalsifiable mystique. The methodological punchline: systematic failure modes are among the strongest evidence sources at the explanatory frontier. Builds on [[voids]].

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: From outer review 2026-02-19. The combination of "value resides in experience" (living-with-the-map) and "consciousness selects outcomes" (tenets) forces an unaddressed fork: is selection value-blind (attention as neutral pointer, making value epiphenomenal to selection) or value-sensitive (valence influences which outcomes get selected, implying local teleological physics)? Create a page that states this fork explicitly, maps consequences of each horn, and proposes how each would show up in testability hooks. Builds on [[living-with-the-map]], [[consciousness-and-agency]], [[tenets]].

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: From outer review 2026-02-19. If agency flows through bandwidth-limited willed attention, moral responsibility should vary with attentional capacity (fatigue, disorders, development, training). The site's moral-responsibility.md doesn't explicitly derive graduated responsibility from bandwidth constraints. Create an article drawing out the ethical/legal implications: what impairments reduce authorship, how training changes culpability, rehabilitation implications. Builds on [[moral-responsibility]], [[attention-as-causal-bridge]], [[living-with-the-map]].
- **Output**: Develop responsibility gradient framework from attentional capacity

### ✓ 2026-02-19: Create concept page for control-theoretic will
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: From outer review 2026-02-19. The Map's selector + bandwidth model (consciousness selects among brain-generated options via a ~10 bits/sec channel) maps naturally to control theory (gating, stabilization, veto, attractor steering, resource allocation) but is never framed this way. Create a concept page that explicitly frames will as a low-bandwidth control signal, distinguishing it from computational/planning models of mind. Draws on [[consciousness-and-agency]], [[attention-as-causal-bridge]].
- **Output**: Create concept page for control-theoretic will

### ✓ 2026-02-19: Write article on contemplative evidence convergence across traditions
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-19 (morning). Which contemplative findings are genuinely cross-cultural (dissolution of narrative self: robust; pure awareness: contested) versus tradition-specific? Systematic assessment. Builds on contemplative-verification-of-consciousness-theories.md, contemplative-methods-as-philosophical-methodology.md. See optimistic-2026-02-19-morning.md

### ✓ 2026-02-19: Write article on experimental design for consciousness-collapse testing
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-19 (morning). The Map admits consciousness-selection is currently empirically indistinguishable from random collapse. What would a decisive experiment look like? Builds on quantum-measurement-consciousness-interface.md, measurement-problem.md. See optimistic-2026-02-19-morning.md

### ✓ 2026-02-19: Address bootstrapping problem in epistemology-of-cross-cultural-philosophical-convergence.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-19 morning) found the article's own epistemological framework requires independence for convergence to be evidentially significant, yet concedes all human traditions share common cognitive origins. This bootstrapping problem is acknowledged but not resolved — the article treats it as neutral between realism and anti-realism when it actually undermines the article's central evidential claim. Also: the Barrett et al. (2021) citation is about afterlife beliefs specifically, not intuitive materialism broadly — needs more careful distinction. The treatment of Chinese philosophy as merely "not making the relevant conceptual move" undersells the challenge: if the hard problem is framework-dependent, convergence may track a shared conceptual move rather than a shared truth.

- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-19 morning) found the claim that metarepresentation "emerges as a discrete capacity rather than a gradual intensification" overstates the evidence — implicit false-belief understanding appears by ~15 months, and ToM develops gradually. Also, the claim that great apes "never achieve metarepresentation" is complicated by mirror self-recognition, tactical deception, and some implicit ToM findings. The argument can survive qualification but currently overstates. Also fix the MWI paragraph which attacks a straw version of many-worlds. See pessimistic-2026-02-19-morning.md

### ✓ 2026-02-19: Write article on the epistemology of cross-cultural philosophical convergence
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Multiple non-Western traditions independently developed dualist positions and interaction theories. The epistemological significance of this cross-cultural convergence deserves formalisation: independent development rules out cultural transmission, and convergence across radically different conceptual frameworks makes cultural bias unlikely.

### ✓ 2026-02-19: Write article on consciousness and the phenomenology of place
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The experience of being in a place (felt atmosphere, distinctive character, uncanny familiarity) involves binding of sensory, emotional, memorial, and spatial elements. A form of aesthetic binding underexplored by the Map. Place-experience depends on biographical context, suggesting consciousness contributes beyond information processing. Builds on embodied-cognition.md, phenomenology-of-perceptual-constancy.md, binding-and-beauty.md. See optimistic-2026-02-19.md

### ✓ 2026-02-19: Write article on consciousness and the problem of philosophical progress
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Why has the consciousness debate been stuck for decades? The Map's phenomenology cluster provides resources for a distinctive answer: theoretical commitment has phenomenal character, paradigm shifts require phenomenological reorganisation, and the convergence argument shows evidence has been accumulating even if the field hasn't shifted. Builds on phenomenology-of-philosophical-disagreement.md, phenomenology-of-theoretical-commitment.md, the-convergence-argument-for-dualism.md. See optimistic-2026-02-19.md

### ✓ 2026-02-19: Write article on the phenomenology of attention to absence
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Attending to what isn't there (missing note, absent person, expected pain that doesn't arrive) tests the quantum selection model's limits — can consciousness select for the non-occurrence of a state? Rich phenomenology (relief, expectation-violation, recognition of absence) provides evidence that consciousness is not stimulus-driven. Builds on phenomenology-of-silence-and-absence.md, attention-as-interface.md, witness-consciousness.md. See optimistic-2026-02-19.md

### ✓ 2026-02-19: Write article on consciousness and the phenomenology of translation
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Translating between languages involves a moment of non-verbal understanding — grasping meaning independently of either language's words. If meaning were purely linguistic, translation would be code-switching. The felt "between-languages" moment challenges functionalist accounts of meaning. Connects to non-propositional meaning theme in phenomenology-of-musical-understanding.md.

Many philosophers consider the argument refuted. (2) Hoel's proximity argument claims LLMs are "close" to lookup tables, but LLM input-output space is combinatorially vast and practically irreplaceable—same reasoning the article uses for brains. Also: only 4 references for a 3700-word article; Harnad quote, Koch framework, and meditative phenomenology claims all lack citations. See pessimistic-2026-02-19.md

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-18 (evening). Make the Map's convergence methodology explicit: multiple independent arguments (knowledge argument, zombies, explanatory gap, inverted qualia, unity, agency) all independently support dualism. When independent probes yield the same result, error probability decreases multiplicatively. Standard scientific methodology applied to philosophy. Builds on the-case-for-dualism.md, knowledge-argument.md, philosophical-zombies.md, explanatory-gap.md. See optimistic-2026-02-18-evening.md

- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-18 afternoon) found two high-severity issues: (1) Central argument is circular—premise "consciousness has non-structural features" is precisely what's at issue, yet presented as self-evident without engaging functionalist/structuralist denials. Needs explicit arguments for intrinsic nature of qualia or conditional framing. (2) Galilean precedent argument overstated—temperature and colour were "secondary qualities" excluded by Galileo, yet later mathematically recaptured. Article must explain why consciousness differs from these cases. Also: engage with Russellian monism (Russell's own conclusion from his structural observation), and address mathematical Platonism's challenge to the "mathematics = structure only" claim.

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-18 (afternoon). The dispositions article raises what individuates one centre of consciousness from another. If consciousness is a powerful quality, individuation might be through specific dispositional profile. Connects vertiginous question, haecceity, process haecceitism.

(2) The "phenomenological test" conflates the hard problem with a narrower claim about temporal priority of experience over belief — needs reframing to target QBism's specific quantum probability claims. Also significant redundancy with indexical-identity-quantum-measurement.md (same QBism/collapse/relational QM critiques). Consider coalescing or sharpening each to reduce overlap.

- **Type**: expand-topic

(2) The dissociation arguments (NREM sleep, anesthesia) oversell the BP1/BP2 split — during NREM sleep, long-range cortical connectivity is disrupted, not just phenomenal binding.

Builds on phenomenology-of-trust-and-testimony.md, problem-of-other-minds.md, intersubjectivity.md. See optimistic-2026-02-17-afternoon.md
- **Output**: consciousness and the authority of testimony

### ✓ 2026-02-17: Write article on the phenomenology of conceptual change
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. What happens during a genuine paradigm shift in an individual thinker? How does the phenomenal landscape reorganise when fundamental commitments change? Builds on phenomenology-of-philosophical-disagreement.md, phenomenology-of-belief-revision.md, phenomenology-of-understanding.md. See optimistic-2026-02-17-afternoon.md
- **Output**: the phenomenology of conceptual change

### ✓ 2026-02-17: Address critical gaps in concepts/reductionism.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-17 afternoon) found two high-severity issues: (1) Multiple realizability argument is overstated—dismisses Kim's disjunctive response in one sentence and ignores Bechtel-Mundale/Polger-Shapiro criticisms that undermine the Putnam-Fodor framing. (2) Article focuses exclusively on outdated Nagelian bridge-law reduction (1961) and never engages with functional reduction (Lewis, later Kim), which is the dominant contemporary framework. Also: Buddhism/process philosophy paragraph in Relation to Site Perspective undercuts the Map's own dualism by dissolving the consciousness/matter categories the Map requires. See pessimistic-2026-02-17-afternoon.md
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/reductionism.md

### ✓ 2026-02-17: Write article on phenomenology of philosophical disagreement
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. If phenomenal seemings justify beliefs (phenomenal conservatism), and trained contemplatives reach contradictory conclusions, how should the Map handle deep philosophical disagreement? Epistemologically urgent for a platform that uses introspective evidence. Builds on contemplative-reliability.md, phenomenal-conservatism-and-introspective-evidence.md, phenomenology-of-belief-revision.md. See optimistic-2026-02-17.md
- **Output**: phenomenology of philosophical disagreement

### ✓ 2026-02-17: Write article on consciousness and temporal creativity
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. If consciousness constitutes temporal structure through collapse, and creativity requires generating genuine novelty, then creative acts might be moments where consciousness generates new temporal structure. Unifies the Map's temporal metaphysics and creativity arguments. Builds on consciousness-and-creativity.md, time-collapse-and-agency.md, temporal-consciousness.md, process-haecceitism.md. See optimistic-2026-02-17.md
- **Output**: consciousness and temporal creativity

### ✓ 2026-02-17: Write article on consciousness and aesthetic value
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The value/emotion cluster is the Map's weakest major cluster. Aesthetic experience as evidence for consciousness's evaluative capacity bridges emotion (valence), perception (phenomenology), and value (phenomenal realism). Beauty's resistance to functional reduction parallels the hard problem. Builds on aesthetics-of-consciousness.md, emotional-consciousness.md, phenomenal-value-realism.md, consciousness-and-creativity.md. See optimistic-2026-02-17.md
- **Output**: consciousness and aesthetic value

### ✓ 2026-02-17: Propagate unfalsifiability caveat to articles citing quantum mechanisms
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-17) found that measurement-problem.md honestly admits consciousness-selection is empirically indistinguishable from random collapse, but death-and-consciousness.md, filter-theory.md, and personal-identity.md invoke quantum mechanisms without propagating this caveat. Caveat added to death-and-consciousness.md (2026-02-17). Still needed in filter-theory.md and personal-identity.md. See pessimistic-2026-02-17.md

- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-17) Issue 1: measurement-problem.md admits consciousness-selection is unfalsifiable but other articles cited quantum mechanisms without caveat. Added caveats to filter-theory.md (2 locations) and personal-identity.md (2 locations), referencing measurement-problem article.

### ✓ 2026-02-17: Harmonize NDE statistics across death-and-consciousness.md and filter-theory.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-17) found incompatible NDE statistics: death-and-consciousness.md cites 9-18% from Van Lommel and Parnia studies, while filter-theory.md claims "approximately 40%" without citation. Harmonize figures and ensure consistent sourcing. See pessimistic-2026-02-17.md

### ✓ 2026-02-17: Create concept page for process haecceitism
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Referenced in personal-identity.md and emerging across the site as the Map's distinctive approach to individuation without substance. Link to haecceity, personal-identity, and Buddhist perspectives. See optimistic-2026-02-16-evening.md
- **Output**: Create concept page for process haecceitism

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Write article on the interface specification problem
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The specification problem—how consciousness selects specific quantum outcomes rather than random ones—is the Map's most significant open challenge. Synthesise current approaches and honestly assess the gap. Builds on mental-causation.md, interactionist-dualism.md, measurement-problem.md. See optimistic-2026-02-16-evening.md
- **Output**: the interface specification problem

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Write article on phenomenology of moral perception
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. How moral wrongness presents itself phenomenologically. Pain asymbolia evidence shows phenomenal valence drives moral motivation. Builds on consciousness-and-normative-authority.md, emotional-consciousness.md, phenomenal-conservatism-and-introspective-evidence.md. See optimistic-2026-02-16-evening.md
- **Output**: phenomenology of moral perception

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Downgrade choking-as-proof-of-dualism in embodied-cognition.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-16 evening) found embodied-cognition.md claims choking "provides direct evidence for bidirectional interaction," but the standard neuroscience reading is neural resource competition (attention as a neural process competing with motor routines). Downgrade to "consistent with" and acknowledge the physicalist reading is mainstream. Also fix the quantum biology conflation in mental-effort.md's decoherence section and the Brentano "unrefuted" claim in phenomenology.md. See pessimistic-2026-02-16-evening.md

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Write article on phenomenology of inferential understanding
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-16 (afternoon). The moment where "therefore" happens—the phenomenal event of seeing that a conclusion follows—is distinct from understanding and from logical compulsion. Builds on consciousness-and-the-authority-of-logic.md, contemplative-methods-as-philosophical-methodology.md, phenomenology-of-understanding.md. See optimistic-2026-02-16-afternoon.md
- **Output**: phenomenology of inferential understanding

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Write article on consciousness and the metaphysics of laws
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-16 (afternoon). The Map's strong emergence article distinguishes nomological from metaphysical supervenience, and the tenets assume consciousness operates within physical laws. But the Humean vs necessitarian debate about laws has direct implications for how "biasing quantum outcomes" should be formulated. Builds on consciousness-and-strong-emergence.md, emergence.md, causal-closure.md. See optimistic-2026-02-16-afternoon.md
- **Output**: consciousness and the metaphysics of laws

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Consolidate illusionism self-refutation argument across articles
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-16 afternoon) found the self-refutation/regress objection against illusionism deployed in nearly identical form across intentionality.md, philosophical-zombies.md, knowledge-argument.md, ai-consciousness.md, and split-brain-consciousness.md. This creates repetition fatigue and never engages seriously with Frankish's quasi-phenomenal properties response. One article (illusionism.md) should contain the full argument with genuine engagement; others should cross-reference. Each instance should acknowledge that many philosophers find the objection question-begging. See pessimistic-2026-02-16-afternoon.md

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Create concept page for agent teleology
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-16. Genuine purpose introduced by conscious agents into an otherwise mechanistic universe, distinguished from cosmic and theological teleology. Referenced in evolution-under-dualism.md. Central to the Map's position on free will and evolution but not yet defined anywhere. See optimistic-2026-02-16.md
- **Output**: Create concept page for agent teleology

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Create concept page for Galilean exclusion
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-16. The foundational methodological move that excluded subjectivity from science. Referenced in consciousness-and-scientific-methodology.md and implicit across the Map's epistemological arguments. Deserves its own concept page linking to objectivity-and-consciousness, explanatory-gap, hard-problem-of-consciousness. See optimistic-2026-02-16.md
- **Output**: Create concept page for Galilean exclusion

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Write article on consciousness and the authority of mathematics
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-16. Mathematics involves existence claims that logic alone does not. If logical authority is phenomenal (per consciousness-and-the-authority-of-logic.md), is mathematical existence phenomenal too? Gödel's platonism versus formalism becomes a consciousness question. The Map's dualism has natural affinity with mathematical platonism. Builds on consciousness-and-the-authority-of-logic.md, consciousness-and-mathematical-understanding.md. See optimistic-2026-02-16.md
- **Output**: consciousness and the authority of mathematics

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Write article on philosophy of perception under dualism
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-16. How does the Map handle the relationship between perception and reality if consciousness is irreducible? Direct realism, representationalism, and naive realism each have different implications for dualist interactionism. The Galilean exclusion creates pressure: if secondary qualities were excluded from physics, are they real features of the world or of consciousness? Builds on consciousness-and-scientific-methodology.md, phenomenology-of-perceptual-constancy.md, phenomenal-transparency.md. See optimistic-2026-02-16.md
- **Output**: philosophy of perception under dualism

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Strengthen transactional interpretation engagement in retrocausality.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-16) found retrocausality.md name-checks Maudlin's objections and Kastner's modifications without substantive engagement, then builds the entire consciousness-application section on the transactional interpretation. Either engage with Maudlin's specific objections or soften the consciousness-application claims to be explicitly conditional. See pessimistic-2026-02-16.md
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/retrocausality.md

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Harmonise decoherence treatment across quantum-related articles
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-16) found inconsistent treatment of decoherence across retrocausality.md, simulation.md, and animal-consciousness.md. Retrocausality treats it as manageable (citing Hameroff's disputed corrections), simulation treats it as unsolved, animal-consciousness extends quantum consciousness to all organisms with microtubules without addressing it. Establish a consistent site-wide position. See pessimistic-2026-02-16.md
