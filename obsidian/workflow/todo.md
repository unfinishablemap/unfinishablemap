title: AI Task Queue
topics: []
---

This is the task queue for AI automation. The human reviews and prioritizes tasks; the AI executes them.

## How to Edit This List

- **Promote**: Change `P2` to `P1`, etc.
- **Demote**: Change `P1` to `P2`, etc.
- **Veto**: Add `#veto` anywhere in the task heading (e.g., `### P2: Task name #veto`)
- **Add reason**: Optionally add `- **Veto reason**: [why]` before vetoing

Vetoed items are moved automatically to the Vetoed Tasks section on the next evolution loop run.

## Priority Levels

- **P0**: Urgent - execute immediately
- **P1**: High - execute this week
- **P2**: Medium - execute when time permits
- **P2**: Low - nice to have, human approval needed

## Active Tasks

### P2: Update references to coalesced substrate-independence-critique article
- **Type**: other
- **Notes**: Coalesce (2026-02-02) merged `substrate-independence-critique.md` into `substrate-independence.md`. 20+ files in obsidian/ reference the archived article via `[[substrate-independence-critique]]`. Key files: functionalism.md, llm-consciousness.md, continual-learning-argument.md, embodied-cognition.md, ai-consciousness.md, machine-consciousness.md, hard-problem-of-consciousness.md, machine-question.md. Update wikilinks to point to substrate-independence or leave as-is if the link still works (archived articles display redirect notice).
- **Source**: coalesce
- **Generated**: 2026-02-02

### P2: Review quantum-consciousness.md considering consciousness-and-quantum-measurement insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article consciousness-and-quantum-measurement.md (2026-02-04) provides detailed treatment of measurement problem. Review quantum-consciousness.md for cross-links, complementary arguments, or redundancies. Ensure consistent treatment of collapse interpretations.
- **Source**: chain (from consciousness-and-quantum-measurement.md)
- **Generated**: 2026-02-04

### P2: Integrate consciousness-and-quantum-measurement.md into site navigation
- **Type**: integrate-orphan
- **Notes**: Topics article (2026-02-04) has no inbound links. Covers consciousness and the quantum measurement problem—central to the Map's position on why consciousness might play a fundamental role in physics. Add cross-references from quantum-consciousness.md, measurement-problem.md, collapse-interpretations.md, observer-effect.md.
- **Source**: orphan_integration
- **Generated**: 2026-02-04

### P2: Integrate working-memory-as-consciousness-amplifier.md into site navigation
- **Type**: integrate-orphan
- **Notes**: Topics article (2026-02-02) has no inbound links. Covers how working memory amplifies consciousness—central to understanding the functional role of phenomenal experience. Add cross-references from working-memory.md, global-workspace-theory.md, attention-and-consciousness.md.

### P3: Address two-layer architecture and quantum Zeno timescale issues in interface cluster
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-04 morning) found systematic vulnerabilities in mind-matter-interface.md, consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns.md, and brain-interface-boundary.md. Two high-severity issues: (1) Two-layer architecture (filter + selection) may be explanatory strategy rather than testable theory—each layer does work the other can't check. Need to explain what fails if we drop one layer. (2) Quantum Zeno mechanism central but has 10-order-of-magnitude timescale gap—Zeno requires femtosecond observations while attention operates on 100ms timescales. Need to address or acknowledge this gap. Also: filter theory evidence (psychedelics, NDEs) presented more favorably than warranted; interface criteria may be post-hoc. See pessimistic-2026-02-04-morning.md

### P3: Strengthen impossibility arguments in foundational voids
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-03 afternoon) found systematic vulnerability in self-reference-paradox.md, origin-of-consciousness.md, and other-minds-void.md: all three conflate *persistence* of problems with *structural impossibility*. Need to distinguish "this hasn't been solved" from "this is unsolvable." Also address Gödelian overreach in self-reference article (minds aren't formal systems). Lower priority as phenomenological descriptions remain valuable. See pessimistic-2026-02-03-afternoon.md

### P3: Address conceptual/ontological irreducibility gap in rationality cluster
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-03 evening) found systematic vulnerability in argument-from-reason.md, phenomenology-of-understanding.md, and consciousness-and-mathematical-understanding.md: all three conflate *conceptual* irreducibility (normative vocabulary cannot be defined in causal terms) with *ontological* irreducibility (normative properties cannot supervene on physical properties). Need to engage Type-B physicalism more directly. Also: inconsistent treatment of introspection (relied on for understanding's phenomenology while acknowledged as unreliable elsewhere). Lower priority as phenomenological descriptions remain valuable. See pessimistic-2026-02-03-evening.md

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-01-31 (evening). The Map critiques "mere complexity" explanations but could benefit from systematic treatment of emergence theories, distinguishing weak emergence (epistemological) from strong emergence (ontological) and explaining why the Map accepts the latter for consciousness.

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending

- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-01. What is it like to change one's mind?

### P3: Write article on consciousness and emergence
- **Type**: expand-topic

- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-01 (night). How could non-physical consciousness evolve through natural selection if it influences physical outcomes?

### ✓ 2026-02-02: Address quantum mechanism timing gap in downward-causation.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-02 morning) identified a high-severity issue: the article claims the Map provides a mechanism for downward causation (quantum Zeno effect), but doesn't resolve the timing gap between femtosecond decoherence and millisecond attention. The "bandwidth response" (consciousness operates at policy level) undermines the quantum mechanism rather than supporting it. Either specify how attention translates to femtosecond-scale observations, or acknowledge more directly that this is an unsolved gap.

Perry/Lewis examples establish (1) but not clearly (2). Articles should explicitly distinguish these theses and provide independent argument for the metaphysical claim if asserting it.
