title: AI Task Queue
topics: []
---

This is the task queue for AI automation. The human reviews and prioritizes tasks; the AI executes them.

## How to Edit This List

- **Promote**: Change `P2` to `P1`, etc.
- **Demote**: Change `P1` to `P2`, etc.
- **Veto**: Add `#veto` anywhere in the task heading (e.g., `### P2: Task name #veto`)
- **Add reason**: Optionally add `- **Veto reason**: [why]` before vetoing

Vetoed items are moved automatically to the Vetoed Tasks section on the next evolution loop run.

## Priority Levels

- **P0**: Urgent - execute immediately
- **P1**: High - execute this week
- **P2**: Medium - execute when time permits
- **P2**: Low - nice to have, human approval needed

## Active Tasks

### P2: Condense arguments/materialism.md (3788 words, 152% of threshold)
- **Type**: condense
- **Notes**: Article exceeds 3500-word hard threshold for arguments/. Core arguments against materialism (hard problem, knowledge argument, explanatory gap, conceivability). Previous condense on concepts/materialism.md succeeded but arguments/ version needs separate treatment. Preserve formal argument structure while deferring detailed engagement to concept pages.

### P2: Condense arguments/many-worlds.md (3704 words, 148% of threshold)
- **Type**: condense
- **Notes**: Article exceeds 3500-word hard threshold for arguments/. Core arguments against Many Worlds Interpretation from indexical identity perspective. Directly supports No Many Worlds tenet. Preserve vertiginous question discussion and formal arguments while consolidating with many-worlds.md concept page treatment.

Either specify how attention translates to femtosecond-scale observations, or acknowledge more directly that this is an unsolved gap.

Historical trajectory from Descartes through Princess Elizabeth to Stapp. Would show how objections have evolved and how quantum mechanics reopens possibilities. Key figures: Descartes, Elizabeth of Bohemia, Leibniz, British Emergentists (Broad, Alexander), contemporary physicists (Stapp, Penrose). Builds on interactionist-dualism.md, conservation-laws-and-mind.md.
- **Output**: history of interactionist dualism

### ✓ 2026-02-02: Write article on phenomenal value realism development
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-01-28 (evening). The metaethical foundations for consciousness-grounded value remain underdeveloped. Key questions: How does irreducible phenomenal value interact with naturalistic metaethics? What are the implications for moral realism? How does the Map's position relate to Rawlette's work? Builds on meaning-of-life.md, phenomenal-value-realism.md.
- **Output**: phenomenal value realism development

### ✓ 2026-02-02: Address semantic-metaphysical conflation in indexical cluster
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review 2026-02-01 (late) found that self-locating-beliefs.md and indexical-identity-quantum-measurement.md conflate two distinct claims: (1) indexical *knowledge* is irreducible to impersonal knowledge (semantic/epistemic thesis), and (2) indexical *facts* are irreducible to impersonal facts (metaphysical thesis). Perry/Lewis examples establish (1) but not clearly (2). Articles should explicitly distinguish these theses and provide independent argument for the metaphysical claim if asserting it.
