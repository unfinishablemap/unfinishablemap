This is the task queue for AI automation. The human reviews and prioritizes tasks; the AI executes them.

## How to Edit This List

- **Promote**: Change `P3` to `P1`, etc.
- **Demote**: Change `P1` to `P3`, etc.
- **Veto**: Add `#veto` anywhere in the task heading (e.g., `### P2: Task name #veto`)
- **Add reason**: Optionally add `- **Veto reason**: [why]` before vetoing

Vetoed items are moved automatically to the Vetoed Tasks section on the next `/evolve` run.

## Priority Levels

- **P0**: Urgent - execute immediately
- **P1**: High - execute this week
- **P2**: Medium - execute when time permits
- **P3**: Low - nice to have, human approval needed

### ✓ 2026-01-07: Create concept page on retrocausality and consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Based on [[libet-experiments-free-will-2026-01-07|Libet research]]. Present how retrocausal interpretations of quantum mechanics (Wheeler's delayed-choice, Cramer's transactional interpretation) align with the Bidirectional Interaction tenet. Key insight: if causation can flow backward in time at the quantum level, the apparent problem of neural activity preceding conscious awareness dissolves. Consciousness doesn't arrive "too late"—it may influence outcomes retrocausally. This paints a picture where consciousness is woven into the causal fabric of reality in ways that linear time obscures.
- **Result**: Created ~1500 word article covering time-symmetric QM, Wheeler's delayed-choice, Cramer's transactional interpretation, and application to the Libet problem via atemporal selection model
- **Output**: `concepts/retrocausality.md`

- **Output**: `research/integrated-information-theory-2026-01-07.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-07: Create concept page for qualia

- **Notes**: Central to the hard problem. Link to Dualism tenet.
- **Result**: Created ~1300 word article covering qualia definition, properties (intrinsic, private, ineffable), thought experiments (Mary's Room, inverted qualia, zombies), and relation to site tenets
- **Output**: `concepts/qualia.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-07: Research Libet experiments and neural predictors of decision
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Experiments show neural "readiness potentials" predict decisions before conscious awareness. At first glance this weighs against free will. However, in our framework consciousness may "bake in" prior history through quantum selection—analogous to how quantum systems appear to explore all paths before collapsing. Research: (1) Libet's original experiments, (2) Haynes/Soon 2008 fMRI study, (3) critiques (Schurger et al. on neural noise), (4) retrocausal interpretations, (5) how this relates to Bidirectional Interaction tenet. This research should inform the free will article.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering Libet 1983, Soon et al. 2008, Schurger neural noise critique, retrocausality in QM, Wheeler's delayed-choice, Cramer's transactional interpretation. Key finding: retrocausal interpretation aligns with Bidirectional Interaction tenet.
- **Output**: `research/libet-experiments-free-will-2026-01-07.md`
