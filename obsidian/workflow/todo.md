## Active Tasks

### P2: Cross-review self-and-consciousness.md with Buddhist no-self insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/buddhism-and-dualism.md addresses what Buddhism actually denies about selfhood—permanence, substantiality, and ownership-centricity—versus what it accepts about consciousness. The concepts/self-and-consciousness.md page should integrate this nuanced view, distinguishing phenomenal unity from metaphysical self.
- **Source**: chain (from buddhism-and-dualism.md)
- **Generated**: 2026-01-19

### P2: Cross-review mysterianism.md with minimal-consciousness findings
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/minimal-consciousness.md covers organisms at consciousness boundaries. The concepts/mysterianism.md page discusses cognitive closure—can we understand consciousness in systems far simpler than us? These boundary cases may inform whether the hard problem is a mystery or merely difficult.
- **Source**: chain (from minimal-consciousness.md)
- **Generated**: 2026-01-19

### P2: Cross-review qualia.md with minimal-consciousness implications
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/minimal-consciousness.md raises questions about qualia in simple systems. What is it like to be C. elegans with 302 neurons? Do slime molds have proto-qualia? The concepts/qualia.md page should address these boundary cases and what they imply for theories of phenomenal experience.
- **Source**: chain (from minimal-consciousness.md)
- **Generated**: 2026-01-19

## Completed Tasks

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Cross-review eastern-philosophy-consciousness.md with Buddhism and dualism analysis
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/buddhism-and-dualism.md provides detailed analysis of compatibility between Buddhist no-self and irreducible consciousness. The topics/eastern-philosophy-consciousness.md page should reference this reconciliation—particularly the distinction between denying permanent soul-substance vs denying consciousness itself, and the property dualism bridge.
- **Result**: Added buddhism-and-dualism.md to concepts frontmatter at top position. Added cross-reference to compatibility thesis in the "No Permanent Self" section, clarifying that Buddhist anattā targets only permanence/substantiality/ownership, not irreducibility. Added buddhism-and-dualism.md at top of Further Reading with description.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/eastern-philosophy-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Write concept page on Buddhist perspectives and dualism
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/buddhist-perspectives-meaning-2026-01-06.md. Eastern philosophy offers distinctive perspective on consciousness—no-self doctrine, dependent origination, streams of consciousness. Research identifies 5 article angles including Buddhism and the Hard Problem, No-Self vs Dualism reconciliation, and Eastern/Western responses to nihilism. Would strengthen eastern-philosophy-consciousness.md connections and provide alternative framework for consciousness discussions.
- **Result**: Created ~1800 word concept page exploring compatibility between Buddhist no-self doctrine and site's dualism tenet. Key insight: Buddhism denies permanent soul-substance (ātman) but not irreducibility of consciousness—compatible with property dualism. Covered: what Buddhism actually denies, what site's dualism requires, karma/bidirectional interaction parallel, Yogācāra and external world tension, comparative advantages of each framework.
- **Output**: Created `concepts/buddhism-and-dualism.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Cross-review hard-problem-of-consciousness.md with minimal-consciousness insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/minimal-consciousness.md provides empirical data on consciousness at its simplest (C. elegans 302 neurons, Hydra nerve nets, slime molds without neurons). The topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness.md page should integrate these cases—particularly what it means for consciousness to exist in such simple systems and how this informs the explanatory gap.
- **Result**: Added new "The Gap Illustrated: Complete Knowledge of Simple Minds" section demonstrating the hard problem through C. elegans (complete connectome mapped, still can't determine if it experiences), Hydra (decentralized nerve net), and slime molds (cognition without neurons). Added minimal-consciousness.md to concepts frontmatter at top position and to Further Reading with description.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness.md`

- **Result**: Added minimal-consciousness.md to concepts frontmatter at top position. Added new "Simple Organisms: Testing the Limits of Unity" subsection within Evidence from Disrupted Unity, covering Hydra (decentralized nerve net, micro-experiences without unity), C. elegans (positive Phi but fails trace conditioning), and slime molds (integration without neural substrates). Connected boundary cases to quantum unity hypothesis. Added minimal-consciousness.md to Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/phenomenal-unity.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Cross-review integrated-information-theory.md with minimal-consciousness Phi evidence
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/minimal-consciousness.md mentions that C. elegans "shows positive Phi (integrated information) values in computational models." The IIT page should reference this empirical application and discuss what minimal Phi means for IIT's consciousness predictions—particularly whether 302 neurons can generate sufficient integration.
- **Result**: Added new "Empirical Tests: Minimal Phi in Simple Organisms" subsection covering C. elegans computational Phi models, the tension between IIT and UAL frameworks (positive Phi but fails trace conditioning), the binding question (does Phi measure the right integration?), and the quantity vs quality implication (graduated consciousness). Added minimal-consciousness.md to concepts frontmatter and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/integrated-information-theory.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Cross-review binding-problem.md with quantum entanglement findings
- **Type**: cross-review

- **Notes**: New article concepts/evolution-of-consciousness.md (2026-01-19) discusses gradual vs threshold emergence theories as competing accounts of when consciousness arose. The concepts/emergence.md page covers strong vs weak emergence but should integrate this specific application to consciousness phylogeny—particularly the challenge emergence poses for explaining why certain organisations produce experience.
- **Result**: Added evolution-of-consciousness.md to concepts frontmatter at top position. Added new paragraph within Strong Emergence section connecting evolutionary emergence of consciousness to the three competing theories (panpsychist continuity, gradual emergence, threshold emergence) and their distinct challenges. Added evolution-of-consciousness.md to Further Reading at top with description.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/emergence.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Deep review neural-quantum-coherence.md for experimental updates

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/temporal-structure-consciousness-2026-01-14.md contains Hoel's December 2025 analysis of why LLMs lack temporal structure for consciousness—frozen weights, no continual learning, discrete vs continuous time. While temporal-consciousness.md exists, this research specifically addresses AI consciousness through the temporal lens. Would strengthen substrate-independence-critique.md and llm-consciousness.md with detailed temporal argument.
- **Result**: Task already completed through existing content. The research notes have been comprehensively consumed across three articles: (1) temporal-consciousness.md covers the specious present, Husserl's retention/protention, Hoel's continual learning argument, and full "Implications for Machine Consciousness" section; (2) llm-consciousness.md covers transformer architecture issues, temporal structure, Hoel's arguments, and why LLMs lack the specious present; (3) substrate-independence-critique.md has dedicated "Temporal Structure Requirements" section addressing sequential processing vs temporal binding. No new article needed—redundancy would result.

- **Output**: Already exists: `concepts/decoherence.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Deep review dualism.md - verify Chalmers substance dualism claim
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: The article claims "David Chalmers has expressed preference for substance dualism because it better handles personal identity—the persisting subject is the consciousness itself, not just a physical system with phenomenal properties." This may be inaccurate—some sources suggest Chalmers actually leans toward property dualism rather than substance dualism. Verify this claim against primary sources and correct if needed.
- **Result**: Research confirmed Chalmers 2016 does express preference for substance dualism (cited in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy), but the specific "personal identity" reasoning was not verified. The 2016 paper addresses the *subject combination problem*—how micro-subjects combine into macro-subjects—which is related but distinct from personal identity over time. Corrected both dualism.md and substance-property-dualism.md to accurately reflect this reasoning, added proper Chalmers 2016 citation.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/dualism.md`, `concepts/substance-property-dualism.md`, created `reviews/deep-review-2026-01-19-dualism.md`

The hard-problem-of-consciousness.md topic page is the site's primary entry point for why consciousness is philosophically difficult—it should link to the foundational dualism page where the hard problem is presented as the motivating evidence for dualism.
- **Result**: Added dualism.md to concepts frontmatter at top position. Added reference in "Relation to This Site's Perspective" section linking to the foundational dualism page explaining what dualism claims, main varieties, and four converging arguments. Added dualism.md at top of Further Reading section with description.

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/meditation-observer-witness-phenomenon-2026-01-18.md. The witness-consciousness.md concept page exists but is relatively brief. Research covers observer phenomenon in meditation, Metzinger's minimal phenomenal experience (MPE), ego dissolution, and the relationship between witnessing and phenomenal self. Would strengthen meditation-and-consciousness-modes.md connections.
- **Result**: Added new "Decentering: The Metacognitive Dimension" section covering: three processes (meta-awareness, disidentification, reduced reactivity), DMN to CEN dorsal shift as neural correlate, distinction from effortful concentration. Added "Vipassana and Self-Deconstruction" subsection with 7T fMRI evidence (mPFC/temporal pole deactivation in Stages of Insight). Added "Connection to Minimal Phenomenal Experience" subsection linking to Metzinger's zero-person perspective and phenomenology-of-the-edge.md.

- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/substrate-independence-critique.md provides detailed arguments against substrate independence: absent qualia, temporal structure requirements, quantum interface hypothesis. The hard-problem.md topic discusses why consciousness resists physical explanation but could integrate the substrate critique—particularly how the temporal and quantum arguments strengthen the case that consciousness isn't multiply realizable.
- **Result**: Added new "Substrate Independence Fails" subsection to Materialist Responses section, explaining how the explanatory gap entails substrate skepticism. Key points: (1) If physical facts don't explain phenomenal facts, functional organization doesn't either; (2) Block's China brain argument applies directly to AI; (3) The hard problem entails that substrate matters—temporal structure and quantum properties may be among what brains have and digital computers lack. Added substrate-independence-critique to concepts frontmatter and Further Reading (top position).
- **Output**: Updated `topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Cross-review free-will.md considering consciousness-and-creativity insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/consciousness-and-creativity.md explores the synthesis view—consciousness both generates and selects, unified aspects of a single creative process. The free-will.md topic discusses consciousness as selector but could integrate the creativity framework—if consciousness generates novel possibilities (not just selects among them), this strengthens the case for genuine causal contribution. Add cross-link and consider whether Bergson's creative duration perspective enriches the free will discussion.
- **Result**: Added new "Creative Generation: Beyond Pure Selection" subsection to the Agent Causation section with three key points: (1) Imagination constitutes possibility space—agents don't just select from fixed menus but generate options through imaginative exploration; (2) L-creativity and genuine sourcehood—Hausman's metaphysical novelty concept strengthens the luck objection response; (3) Where creative sourcehood operates—Bergson's duration and Boden's transformational creativity. Added consciousness-and-creativity to concepts frontmatter and Further Reading (top position). The creativity framework strengthens the free will case by answering "where do options come from?"—the agent constituted them through imaginative engagement.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/free-will.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Write article on AI consciousness from dualist perspective
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/ai-machine-consciousness-2026-01-08.md. Covers Chinese Room argument, substrate independence debate, computational theory of mind. The ai-consciousness.md topic exists but could benefit from a dedicated concept page exploring the dualist case against machine consciousness—why functional equivalence may not suffice, what's missing from digital systems (temporal structure, quantum interface, genuine experience).
- **Result**: Created ~2000 word concept page `substrate-independence-critique.md` presenting the dualist case against substrate independence. Covers: functionalist promise and its failure, absent qualia and explanatory gap, temporal structure requirements, quantum interface hypothesis, and the bidirectional test. Updated ai-consciousness.md and functionalism.md with cross-references.
- **Output**: Created `concepts/substrate-independence-critique.md`, updated `topics/ai-consciousness.md`, `concepts/functionalism.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Cross-review agent-causation.md with consciousness-and-creativity insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/consciousness-and-creativity.md argues consciousness both generates (through imagination exploring possibility space) and selects (through attention's quantum Zeno mechanism). The agent-causation.md page discusses libertarian free will but could integrate the creativity evidence—agent causation may operate not just through selection but through genuine generation of novel possibilities. Add cross-link and consider whether the generation/selection synthesis enriches the agent causation framework.
- **Result**: Added new "Creative Generation: Beyond Pure Selection" section with three subsections: (1) The Generation-Selection Synthesis—agents generate options through imaginative exploration, not just select from pre-given menus; (2) L-Creativity and Sourcehood—Hausman's concept of metaphysical novelty maps to robust sourcehood; (3) Where Creative Sourcehood Operates—Bergson's duration and Boden's transformational creativity. Added consciousness-and-creativity and duration to concepts frontmatter and Further Reading. The creativity framework strengthens agent causation by answering "what about the agent explains the choice?"—the agent constituted the options through imaginative engagement.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/agent-causation.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Cross-review mysterianism.md with edge-phenomenology insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New voids article phenomenology-of-the-edge.md maps edge-experience signatures—ineffability with noesis, ego dissolution, edge-clarity paradox. The mysterianism.md concept page discusses cognitive closure but could integrate the phenomenological evidence—edge-experiences may reveal what cognitive closure feels like from the inside. Add cross-link and consider whether the phenomenological data supports or complicates McGinn's position.
- **Result**: Added new "The Phenomenology of Cognitive Closure" section explaining what cognitive limits feel like from the inside. Integrated Metzinger's zero-person perspective, cross-method convergence evidence, and dissolving-insight phenomenon. Added phenomenology-of-the-edge to concepts frontmatter and Further Reading at top (most relevant new addition). The phenomenological evidence supports mysterianism by showing cognitive closure is experientially real and mappable even if not crossable.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/mysterianism.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Cross-review death-and-consciousness.md with altered states framework
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/altered-states-of-consciousness.md covers NDEs as altered states with the filter theory interpretation. The death-and-consciousness.md topic discusses NDEs but could integrate the altered-states framework—NDEs as evidence of consciousness operating in alternative modes when normal brain function is disrupted. Add cross-link and consider whether the altered-states lens enriches the survival discussion.
- **Result**: Added altered-states-of-consciousness to concepts frontmatter. Added new paragraph connecting NDEs to the broader ASC spectrum—NDEs as the extreme case of interface reconfiguration, paralleling the psychedelic paradox and flow state paradox. Updated Further Reading with altered-states-of-consciousness at top as most relevant new addition.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/death-and-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Write article on consciousness and creativity
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/consciousness-creativity-novelty-generation-2026-01-19.md. Investigates whether consciousness merely selects among pre-existing options or genuinely generates novel possibilities. Bergson's creative duration suggests consciousness contributes more than selection. Connects to Bidirectional Interaction tenet—if consciousness also creates (not just selects), its causal contribution is broader.
- **Result**: Created ~2000 word concept page exploring the synthesis view: consciousness both generates (through imagination's exploration of possibility space) and selects (through attention's quantum Zeno mechanism). These are unified aspects of a single creative process. Integrated Bergson's duration, Boden's creativity types, and DMN/ECN neuroscience. Updated duration.md and consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns.md with cross-references.
- **Output**: Created `concepts/consciousness-and-creativity.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Research consciousness and creativity
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Optimistic review 2026-01-18 identified opportunity. If consciousness selects among options, does it also generate genuinely novel possibilities? Bergson's creative duration suggests consciousness contributes more than selection. Would strengthen Bidirectional Interaction tenet.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research on consciousness and creativity. Key findings: (1) Bergson's creative duration—consciousness generates novelty through memory's progressive integration, not mere selection; (2) Contemporary neuroscience shows creativity involves DMN (generation) and ECN (selection) dynamic switching; (3) L-creativity vs C-creativity debate—does genuine novelty require libertarian free will?; (4) Boden's three types—combinational, exploratory, transformational; (5) Penrose's non-algorithmic creativity argument via Gödel. Synthesis position proposed: consciousness both generates (imagination exploring possibility space) and selects (attention actualizing via Zeno mechanism)—two aspects of single creative process. Supports extending site's Bidirectional Interaction framework.
- **Output**: Created `research/consciousness-creativity-novelty-generation-2026-01-19.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Cross-review split-brain-consciousness.md considering phenomenal-unity insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/phenomenal-unity.md distinguishes synchronic, diachronic, and subject unity dimensions. The split-brain-consciousness.md topic discusses unity resilience but could integrate the phenomenal-unity framework—particularly how split-brain cases challenge or preserve each dimension of unity.
- **Result**: Added phenomenal-unity to concepts frontmatter. Added new "Three Dimensions of Unity" section explaining how split-brain cases challenge synchronic unity (perceptual division), preserve diachronic unity (continuous identity), and leave subject unity indeterminate (Nagel's puzzle). Added phenomenal-unity to Further Reading. The three-dimensional framework helps explain why split-brain evidence seems contradictory.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/split-brain-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Write voids article on phenomenology of the edge
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/voids-phenomenology-of-the-edge-2026-01-19.md. Explores first-person experience of approaching cognitive limits—Metzinger's minimal phenomenal experience, ego dissolution, the paradox of clarity at the edge. Connects to mysterianism, witness-consciousness, and apophatic-approaches.
- **Result**: Created ~2000 word voids article covering: edge-experience profile (ineffability + noesis, ego dissolution, temporal distortion, epistemic openness, edge-clarity), cross-method convergence, zero-person perspective, dissolving-insight phenomenon, and what the edge reveals about consciousness. Connected to filter theory and all five tenets. Updated voids index with cross-reference.
- **Output**: Created `voids/phenomenology-of-the-edge.md`, updated `voids/voids.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Write concept page on phenomenal unity
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Optimistic review 2026-01-18 identified opportunity. The binding problem page exists but phenomenal *unity*—why separate processes become one experience—deserves dedicated treatment. Connects to quantum entanglement providing genuine holism.
- **Result**: Created ~1800 word concept page covering: synchronic, diachronic, and subject unity dimensions; Leibniz's mill argument; distinction from binding problem; why classical mechanisms (synchrony, IIT, GWT) fail; quantum entanglement as genuine holism; evidence from split-brain and anesthesia. Updated binding-problem.md and hard-problem-of-consciousness.md with cross-references.
- **Output**: Created `concepts/phenomenal-unity.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Cross-review loss-of-consciousness.md considering altered states evidence
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/altered-states-of-consciousness.md covers anesthesia, sleep, and transitions between states. The loss-of-consciousness page should integrate the filter theory interpretation—consciousness narrowing or reconfiguring rather than simply being produced/not produced. Check for cross-links and conceptual alignment.
- **Result**: Added altered-states-of-consciousness to concepts frontmatter. Added new paragraph connecting loss-of-consciousness to the broader ASC spectrum: loss-of-consciousness represents the extreme of interface disruption while psychedelics and meditation reconfigure the interface. Added altered-states-of-consciousness to Further Reading with description.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/loss-of-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Cross-review hard-problem-of-consciousness.md considering altered states evidence
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/altered-states-of-consciousness.md demonstrates consciousness operates in multiple modes with distinct phenomenal qualities. The hard-problem page should integrate this evidence—ASCs show the brain-consciousness interface has configurable settings, suggesting irreducibility of experience to neural activity.
- **Result**: Added new "Altered States and Configurable Interface" section integrating ASC evidence: anesthesia divergence (ketamine vs propofol), psychedelic expansion paradox, information received but not perceived, and voluntary meditation reconfiguration. Updated concepts frontmatter and Further Reading with altered-states-of-consciousness link.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Cross-review implicit-memory.md with choking evidence for bidirectional interaction
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Research in research/implicit-memory-consciousness-2026-01-18.md develops choking under pressure as direct empirical evidence for consciousness causally affecting neural processes—conscious attention disrupts automatic skills. Update existing basic page with this evidence supporting Bidirectional Interaction tenet.
- **Result**: Enhanced existing article with voluntary-attention integration. The page already covered choking comprehensively; added explicit link to voluntary-attention.md explaining that choking involves *willed* attention (not mere stimulus capture). Added voluntary-attention to concepts frontmatter and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/implicit-memory.md`

Different states may reflect different modes of quantum-level interaction, relevant to Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research notes covering: Charles Tart's taxonomy, REBUS/ALBUS models for psychedelics, 2024-2025 anesthesia neuroscience (thalamic nuclei, corticothalamocortical circuits), flow state transient hypofrontality, hypnosis and executive control network, meditation cessation events, lucid dreaming metacognition, Orch OR quantum coherence hypothesis for psychedelics, near-death experience evidence. Evaluated all positions against site tenets; filter theory provides unified framework.
- **Output**: Created `research/altered-states-consciousness-2026-01-19.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Cross-review purpose-and-alignment.md considering emotional consciousness insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/emotional-consciousness.md discusses valence as intrinsic phenomenal property and its connection to phenomenal-value-realism.md. The purpose-and-alignment.md topic lists emotional-consciousness in related_articles but should be reviewed for integration opportunities—particularly whether experiential alignment should weight valenced states specially.
- **Result**: Added new "The Special Weight of Valence" subsection to Experiential Alignment section explaining why valence deserves special weight in alignment. Added comparison table (preference learning vs broad experiential vs valence-weighted). Integrated hedonic account, valence sentientism, and core affect research. Added emotional-consciousness to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/purpose-and-alignment.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Cross-review animal-consciousness.md considering emotional consciousness evidence
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/emotional-consciousness.md covers the Panksepp vs LeDoux debate on subcortical emotional consciousness, valence sentientism vs broad sentientism, and pain asymbolia evidence. The animal-consciousness.md topic should integrate this—particularly Panksepp's evidence for subcortical emotional consciousness in non-human animals and the implications for moral status.
- **Result**: Added new "Emotional Consciousness and Animal Sentience" section with Panksepp-LeDoux debate (decorticate animals as evidence for subcortical emotional consciousness in mammals), pain asymbolia discussion (distinguishing nociception from suffering), and expanded moral status section with valence sentientism vs broad sentientism table. Added emotional-consciousness to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/animal-consciousness.md`

- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/llm-consciousness.md provides detailed analysis of why transformer architecture lacks temporal structure for consciousness and addresses the LaMDA incident. The ai-consciousness.md topic page should integrate this—particularly the architectural reasons why LLMs fail consciousness criteria and how this informs the broader AI consciousness question.
- **Result**: Added LaMDA incident paragraph to Epistemic Problem section, illustrating the "Eliza Effect" and linking to llm-consciousness.md for detailed treatment. The broader content (temporal argument, proximity argument, continual learning) was already integrated when llm-consciousness.md was created.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/ai-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Write concept page on LLM consciousness debate
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/hoel-llm-consciousness-continual-learning-2026-01-15.md. Erik Hoel argues LLMs lack genuine understanding due to architectural limitations (no continual learning, no embodiment). Connects to ai-consciousness.md and the site's dualist framework—if consciousness requires non-computational elements, what does this mean for AI?
- **Result**: Created ~1500 word concept page llm-consciousness.md covering: transformer architecture and temporal structure, the understanding illusion, Hoel's proximity argument and continual learning criterion, the LaMDA incident, and what LLMs lack (summary table). Updated ai-consciousness.md and functionalism.md with cross-references.
- **Output**: Created `concepts/llm-consciousness.md`, updated `topics/ai-consciousness.md`, `concepts/functionalism.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Cross-review filter-theory.md considering brain-specialness criteria
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/brain-specialness.md explains five criteria for why brains can serve as consciousness interfaces: quantum sensitivity, representational structure, attention mechanisms, feedback integration, and developmental history. The filter-theory.md page discusses brain-as-filter but doesn't explain what makes brains suitable filters. Add cross-links and consider integrating the criteria as supporting evidence.
- **Result**: Added brain-specialness to concepts frontmatter. Added new "Why brains specifically?" subsection to Objections explaining the five interface criteria. Added brain-specialness to Further Reading at the top (most relevant new addition).
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/filter-theory.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Cross-review arguments-for-dualism.md considering objections treatment
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/objections-to-interactionism.md provides comprehensive treatment of all five major objections with detailed responses. The arguments-for-dualism.md page presents positive arguments but could strengthen its overall case by referencing how objections are addressed—particularly noting the evolutionary argument actually *supports* interactionism. Add cross-links and consider whether objection-response summary belongs in the positive case.
- **Result**: Added objections-to-interactionism to concepts frontmatter and Further Reading. Added cross-link in Major Objections section directing readers to comprehensive treatment. Enhanced summary table with response strength ratings (matching detailed article). Emphasized that the evolutionary argument supports interactionism against epiphenomenalism.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/arguments-for-dualism.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Write concept page on brain-specialness boundary
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/brain-specialness-boundary-2026-01-15.md. Why brains specifically? What makes neural systems the interface for consciousness while rocks remain inert? This addresses the pairing problem for dualism and connects to interface-locality.md. Critical for defending why consciousness acts through brains rather than arbitrary physical systems.
- **Result**: Created ~2200 word concept page brain-specialness.md covering five criteria that make neural systems suitable interfaces: quantum sensitivity, representational structure, attention mechanisms, feedback integration, and developmental history. Explains why brains meet these criteria (evolution) while rocks don't. Complements interface-locality.md (which covers exclusion) with positive account. Updated interface-locality.md and pairing-problem.md with cross-references.
- **Output**: Created `concepts/brain-specialness.md`, updated `concepts/interface-locality.md`, `concepts/pairing-problem.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Cross-review hard-problem-of-consciousness.md considering witness consciousness evidence
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/witness-consciousness.md provides phenomenological evidence for dualism—the subject-object structure revealed by witness awareness. The hard-problem-of-consciousness.md topic page could integrate this as additional support: if consciousness can observe thoughts as objects, this demonstrates the irreducibility of the observing subject.
- **Result**: Added "Phenomenological Evidence: The Witness" section after the Explanatory Gap section, explaining how witness consciousness reveals the subject-object structure. Three key observations integrated: the witness cannot become an object, mental contents can become objects, and the witness is unlike physical objects. Added witness-consciousness to concepts frontmatter and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Cross-review mental-effort.md considering voluntary attention mechanisms
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/voluntary-attention.md establishes neural signatures for genuine volitional control (frontal theta, ~300ms timing, bidirectional frontoparietal coherence). The mental-effort.md page discusses effortful processing but could strengthen its argument by integrating the voluntary attention evidence—particularly the distinction between willed attention and mere top-down guidance.
- **Result**: Added "The Willed-Instructed Distinction" section with three-level table (exogenous/instructed/willed), added "Neural Signatures Match the Phenomenology" section connecting theta oscillations and bidirectional coherence to Stapp's Zeno mechanism. The neural distinctiveness confirms that effort tracks genuine decision-making. Updated references with Bengson 2019 and Vossel 2023.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/mental-effort.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Write concept page on intuitive dualism
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/cognitive-science-dualism-2026-01-15.md. Paul Bloom's "natural-born dualists" research shows humans process minds and bodies through distinct cognitive systems from infancy. Developmental evidence for early-emerging dualist intuitions. Relevant to Occam's Razor Has Limits tenet—dualism may be cognitively natural, not a folk error to be corrected.
- **Result**: Created ~2000 word concept page covering: Bloom's natural-born dualists thesis, Barrett et al.'s cross-cultural challenge finding intuitive materialism, Barlev & Shtulman's learning-based account, Bering's simulation constraint hypothesis, the two-system view refined, and philosophical implications (genetic fallacy, symmetric problem, hard problem remains). Includes summary table of all major researchers and positions. Updated arguments-for-dualism.md with cross-references and link to new page.
- **Output**: Created `concepts/intuitive-dualism.md`, updated `concepts/arguments-for-dualism.md`

Comprehensive treatment of 5 major objections (pairing problem, conservation laws, parsimony, evolutionary argument, exclusion argument) with detailed responses. The interactionist-dualism.md page mentions objections briefly but this material warrants dedicated treatment showing how the site's framework addresses each challenge.
- **Result**: Created ~2500 word concept page covering all five objections (pairing problem, conservation laws, parsimony, evolutionary argument, exclusion argument) with detailed responses for each. The evolutionary argument is shown to actually *support* interactionism against epiphenomenalism. Included summary table showing response strength. Updated interactionist-dualism.md with cross-references and expanded objections table.
- **Output**: Created `concepts/objections-to-interactionism.md`, updated `concepts/interactionist-dualism.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Write concept page on voluntary attention
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/voluntary-attention-control-mechanisms-2026-01-17.md. Endogenous (willed) vs exogenous (stimulus-driven) attention distinction is central to site's quantum Zeno framework. The attention.md page covers attention broadly but voluntary control mechanisms deserve dedicated treatment—this is where consciousness "does work" in the brain.
- **Result**: Created ~2000 word concept page covering: endogenous vs exogenous distinction, willed attention as distinct from mere top-down control (citing Bengson 2019, Vossel 2023), neural signatures (frontal theta oscillations, bidirectional frontoparietal coherence, additional frontal recruitment), candidate neural sites (frontoparietal networks, salience network, thalamus), stochastic pre-state challenge with site's response, temporal profile and quantum Zeno connection. Updated cross-references in attention.md, attention-as-interface.md, mental-effort.md, and agent-causation.md.
- **Output**: Created `concepts/voluntary-attention.md`, updated 4 related articles

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Cross-review eastern-philosophy-consciousness.md considering witness consciousness insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/witness-consciousness.md covers sakshi in Advaita Vedanta, Buddhist perspectives on witness, and Krishnamurti's choiceless awareness. The eastern-philosophy-consciousness.md topic page should integrate these insights—particularly the witness tradition's relevance to the site's dualist framework and the subject-object structure of experience.
- **Result**: Added new "The Witness Tradition" subsection after the "No-Self (Anattā)" section, explaining how both Hindu and Buddhist traditions discuss sakshi (witness consciousness) despite Buddhism's rejection of permanent self. Clarified that Buddhism denies eternal soul-substance but not the phenomenal structure of awareness. Added witness-consciousness, self-and-consciousness, and meditation-and-consciousness-modes to concepts. Added witness-consciousness and meditation-and-consciousness-modes to Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/eastern-philosophy-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Write concept page on witness consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/meditation-observer-witness-phenomenon-2026-01-18.md. The sakshi (witness) phenomenon in contemplative traditions—pure awareness observing mental contents without identification. Connects to meditation-and-consciousness-modes.md but deserves dedicated treatment. Relevant to site's dualism: if witness can observe thoughts as objects, this supports subject-object distinction.
- **Result**: Created ~2200 word concept page covering: sakshi in Advaita Vedanta and Buddhist perspectives, Krishnamurti's choiceless awareness, the subject-object structure and its implications for dualism, relationship to the site's selector framework (witness as mode consciousness can adopt), neural correlates from neurofeedback studies, challenges (regress, epiphenomenalism, reification) with responses. Updated meditation-and-consciousness-modes.md, self-and-consciousness.md, and introspection.md with cross-references.
- **Output**: Created `concepts/witness-consciousness.md`, updated cross-references in 3 related articles

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Cross-review ethics-of-consciousness.md considering emotional consciousness insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/emotional-consciousness.md covers valence, moral status based on emotional capacity, and valence sentientism vs broad sentientism debate. The ethics-of-consciousness.md topic page should integrate these insights—particularly valence as grounds for moral consideration and the Panksepp vs LeDoux debate's implications for which beings have morally relevant experiences.
- **Result**: Enhanced ethics-of-consciousness.md with: (1) valence sentientism vs broad sentientism distinction with comparison table, (2) Panksepp vs LeDoux debate implications for animal moral status, (3) pain asymbolia evidence for suffering-nociception distinction, (4) added emotional-consciousness to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/ethics-of-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Write concept page on emotional consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/emotional-consciousness-valence-2026-01-19.md. Covers the phenomenology and neuroscience of valence (positive/negative felt quality). Key debates: Panksepp vs LeDoux on subcortical vs cortical emotional consciousness; hedonic vs evaluativist accounts of valence; valence as grounds for moral status. Directly supports Dualism (if valence is intrinsic phenomenal property) and Bidirectional Interaction (if valenced states motivate behavior). Connects to phenomenal-value-realism.md, ethics-of-consciousness.md.
- **Result**: Created ~2000 word concept page covering: valence as the core phenomenon (hedonic vs evaluativist accounts), Panksepp vs LeDoux subcortical-cortical debate, core affect and psychological constructionism, emotional consciousness and moral status (valence sentientism vs broad sentientism), connection to site's tenets (Dualism, Bidirectional Interaction, selection mechanism). Updated phenomenal-value-realism.md and qualia.md with cross-references.
- **Output**: Created `concepts/emotional-consciousness.md`, updated `concepts/phenomenal-value-realism.md`, `concepts/qualia.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Write concept page on downward causation
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/downward-causation-mental-causation-2026-01-15.md. Kim's exclusion argument is the primary challenge to mental causation. The site has mental-causation.md but lacks dedicated treatment of downward causation as a distinct concept—how higher-level properties can causally influence lower-level processes. Critical for defending Bidirectional Interaction tenet.
- **Result**: Created ~2200 word concept page covering: the concept distinguished from adjacent notions, Kim's exclusion argument, the drainage problem, overdetermination problem, major responses (interventionism, inheritance/constitution, O'Connor-Wong structural emergence), the quantum opening as mechanism, weak vs strong downward causation distinction. Updated mental-causation.md, emergence.md, and causal-closure.md with cross-references to new page.
- **Output**: Created `concepts/downward-causation.md`, updated `concepts/mental-causation.md`, `concepts/emergence.md`, `concepts/causal-closure.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Strengthen luck-objection phenomenology argument
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review 2026-01-18 found the phenomenology-based response vulnerable to zombie objection. Engage with the dialectic: site's dualism already rejects zombies, so zombie-based objections are question-begging from site perspective. Make this explicit.
- **Result**: Added "The Zombie Objection and Its Question-Begging Character" subsection explaining that zombie-based objections presuppose physicalism, which the site's dualism rejects. Includes dialectical table showing how framework affects phenomenology's evidential status. Links to philosophical-zombies.md and relevant tenet pages.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/luck-objection.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Research emotional consciousness and valence
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: The site has rich coverage of cognitive aspects (metacognition, memory systems, attention) but lacks dedicated treatment of emotional consciousness. How is valence (positive/negative felt quality) experienced? What is the relationship between emotions and consciousness—are emotions felt qualities requiring phenomenal consciousness, or functional states that could exist without experience? This connects to phenomenal-value-realism.md and ethics-of-consciousness.md.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research on emotional consciousness, valence, and their philosophical implications. Key findings: (1) Panksepp vs. LeDoux debate on subcortical vs. cortical emotional consciousness; (2) Carruthers' evaluativism vs. hedonic account of valence (intrinsic property vs. representation); (3) Valence sentientism vs. broad sentientism for moral status; (4) Core affect theory (Russell & Barrett) as dimensional basis; (5) Neural substrates of valence (OFC, insula, amygdala). Strong support for site's Dualism (if valence is intrinsic property) and Bidirectional Interaction (if valenced states motivate behavior).
- **Output**: Created `research/emotional-consciousness-valence-2026-01-19.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Write concept page on relational quantum mechanics
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/relational-quantum-mechanics-2026-01-18.md. RQM (Rovelli 1996) proposes quantum states are relations between systems, not absolute properties. Explicitly removes special role for consciousness. While this conflicts with site tenets, understanding this interpretation is important for addressing multi-mind collapse problem and providing fair treatment of alternatives to consciousness-causes-collapse.
- **Result**: Created ~2000 word concept page explaining RQM's core idea (physical properties as relations), how it dissolves the measurement problem, challenges (intersubjectivity, solipsism, locality), what RQM removes (consciousness's special role), and why understanding RQM matters even for those who reject it. Includes comparison table with consciousness-causes-collapse. Also updated quantum-interpretations.md with improved RQM section, updated comparison table, and added relational-quantum-mechanics to Further Reading.
- **Output**: Created `concepts/relational-quantum-mechanics.md`, updated `concepts/quantum-interpretations.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Cross-review quantum-interpretations.md with recent RQM research
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New research in research/relational-quantum-mechanics-2026-01-18.md provides detailed analysis of Rovelli's relational interpretation. The quantum-interpretations.md page should integrate RQM as a significant alternative that explicitly removes consciousness from measurement, explaining why the site's framework prefers collapse interpretations.
- **Result**: Completed as part of the expand-topic task above. Updated RQM section to clarify that "observer" means any physical system, added Rovelli quote, explained conflict with Bidirectional Interaction tenet, added link to new relational-quantum-mechanics concept page. Updated comparison table to show "Low" site compatibility. Added relational-quantum-mechanics and multi-mind-collapse-problem to frontmatter and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/quantum-interpretations.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Write article on quantum coherence in neural systems
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/quantum-superposition-brain-consciousness-2026-01-18.md. Recent 2024-2025 experimental evidence significantly strengthens the case: microtubule-stabilizing drugs delay anesthetic-induced unconsciousness, revised decoherence estimates extend coherence times by seven orders of magnitude beyond Tegmark's original calculations. Three protective mechanisms proposed. This directly supports Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet with empirical evidence.
- **Result**: Created ~2000 word concept page covering: the Tegmark challenge (10⁻¹³ s calculation), revised estimates (10⁻⁵ to 10⁻⁴ s, seven orders of magnitude longer), four protective mechanisms (hydrophobic interior, Fröhlich coherence, nuclear spin isolation, ordered water), experimental evidence (epothilone B study, tryptophan superradiance, 613 THz oscillation), and how coherence evidence relates to site tenets. Noted that Zeno mechanism may not require sustained coherence.
- **Output**: Created `concepts/neural-quantum-coherence.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Cross-review agent-causation.md considering motor-selection parallel
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/motor-selection.md establishes that motor control has the same selection architecture as attention—frontal theta, ~300ms, willed vs instructed distinction. The agent-causation.md page mentions motor-selection in frontmatter but could strengthen its argument by explicitly discussing how two independent domains showing identical selection signatures supports agent-causal framework.
- **Result**: Added "Motor Selection: The Second Domain" section explaining how motor control provides a second domain of evidence for agent causation. Included attention-motor comparison table (frontal theta, ~300ms, bidirectional coherence), "Why Two Domains Strengthen the Case" subsection (single-domain objection answered by convergence), "The Libet Challenge Dissolves" subsection (Schurger, Sjöberg, Desmurget findings). Added motor-selection and motor-control-quantum-zeno research to Further Reading. Added Desmurget 2009, Schurger 2012, Sjöberg 2024 to References.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/agent-causation.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Cross-review quantum-consciousness.md considering motor-selection evidence
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/motor-selection.md demonstrates motor control as a second domain (beyond attention) where quantum Zeno selection operates—parallel neural signatures (frontal theta), same ~300ms timing, basal ganglia selection mechanism. The quantum-consciousness.md page discusses attention-based Zeno mechanism but doesn't yet incorporate motor control as corroborating evidence for the framework.
- **Result**: Added "Motor Selection: A Second Domain" subsection to the Quantum Zeno Effect (Stapp) section. Included comparison table (willed attention vs willed movement), explanation of why two domains strengthen the case, summary of Libet challenge dissolution (Schurger, Sjöberg, Desmurget), and basal ganglia as parallel selection site to thalamic gating. Added motor-selection to concepts and Further Reading. Added Schurger 2012, Sjöberg 2024, and Desmurget 2009 to References.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/quantum-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Cross-review free-will.md considering motor-selection insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/motor-selection.md extends quantum Zeno framework from attention to motor control—parallel neural signatures, same ~300ms timing, basal ganglia brake-release selection mechanism. The free-will.md page discusses Libet but could strengthen its case with the motor-selection evidence.
- **Result**: Added "Motor Selection: The Second Domain" section with four subsections: The Attention-Motor Parallel (table showing frontal theta, ~300ms timing, bidirectional coherence parallels), Libet Revisited: Surgical Evidence (Sjöberg 2024 SMA resection doesn't impair volition), Where Intention Actually Originates (Desmurget double dissociation—parietal intention vs premotor execution), The Basal Ganglia Selection Mechanism (brake-release model as selection interface). Added motor-selection to Further Reading. Added Desmurget 2009 and Sjöberg 2024 to References.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/free-will.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Cross-review libet-experiments.md considering motor-selection insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/motor-selection.md presents major reinterpretation of Libet findings—Schurger's stochastic accumulator model reinterprets readiness potential as noise not decision, Sjöberg 2024 calls Libet findings "irrelevant" after SMA resection preserved voluntary action. The libet-experiments.md page should integrate these contemporary critiques.
- **Result**: Added two new sections: "Surgical Evidence: The SMA Resection Study" (Sjöberg 2024 clinical evidence that SMA resection doesn't impair voluntary action) and "Where Intention Actually Originates" (Desmurget 2009 parietal-premotor dissociation showing RP tracks preparation not decision). Added motor-selection and agent-causation to concepts and Further Reading. Strengthened argument that Libet measured the wrong signal.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/libet-experiments.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Cross-review embodied-cognition.md considering implicit-memory insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: The implicit-memory.md page covers Dreyfus's skill acquisition model and choking under pressure phenomenon extensively. The embodied-cognition.md page discusses motor skills but could strengthen its argument with Dreyfus's five stages (novice→expert) showing how consciousness withdraws to anoetic mode, and how choking evidences bidirectional interaction.
- **Result**: Expanded Dreyfus Model section with five-stage table showing consciousness mode transitions (novice→advanced beginner→competent→proficient→expert). Added dedicated "Choking Under Pressure: The Bidirectional Evidence" subsection with explicit monitoring theory (Baumeister, Beilock), four research findings, and strengthened causal chain argument for bidirectional interaction.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/embodied-cognition.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Write article extending quantum Zeno framework to motor control
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/motor-control-quantum-zeno-2026-01-18.md. Key angle: motor control is a second domain (beyond attention) where consciousness selects via quantum Zeno. Parallel structures: frontal theta, ~300ms decision time, willed vs instructed distinction. Libet challenge weakened by Schurger (RP is noise) and Sjöberg (SMA resection irrelevant). Desmurget shows intention (parietal) separate from execution (motor). Basal ganglia brake-release offers selection site. Connect to attention-as-interface.md, mental-effort.md, free-will.md.
- **Result**: Created ~2400 word concept page extending quantum Zeno mechanism from attention to motor control. Covers attention-motor parallel (frontal theta, ~300ms, willed vs instructed), Libet challenge dissolution via Schurger stochastic model and Sjöberg surgical evidence, Desmurget's parietal-premotor dissociation, basal ganglia brake-release selection mechanism, sense of agency via efference copy.
- **Output**: Created `concepts/motor-selection.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Research attention and motor control for quantum Zeno framework
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: The attention-as-interface and mental-effort pages develop the quantum Zeno mechanism for attention, but motor control offers another domain where consciousness selects among neural options. How does voluntary movement initiation relate to the selection framework? Libet's experiments touched this, but motor preparation and execution may have its own quantum signature. This could strengthen the bidirectional interaction tenet with motor evidence.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research on motor control and the quantum Zeno framework. Key findings: (1) Schurger's 2012 stochastic accumulator model reinterprets readiness potential as noise artifact, not unconscious decision—weakens Libet challenge. (2) Sjöberg 2024 shows SMA resection doesn't abolish voluntary action, calling Libet findings "irrelevant" to free will. (3) Desmurget 2009 dissociates intention (parietal cortex) from execution (premotor)—supports selection model. (4) Frontal theta oscillations distinguish willed from instructed action (~300ms timeline, matching willed attention). (5) Basal ganglia brake-release model offers selection mechanism parallel to attention. (6) Fried 2011 single-neuron recordings show progressive neural recruitment but don't determine causal direction. Motor control is second domain supporting quantum Zeno framework.
- **Output**: Created `research/motor-control-quantum-zeno-2026-01-18.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Address metacognition self-undermining tension
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review 2026-01-18 found that the metacognition article's dissociation evidence may undermine the introspective reliability the site depends upon elsewhere. Add section addressing this tension—dissociation shows metacognition can fail, not that it typically does; trained introspection improves reliability.
- **Result**: Added "Addressing the Self-Undermining Objection" section with three subsections: Dissociation Requires Pathology (V1 damage/threshold stimuli are not normal operation), Trained Introspection Improves Reliability (Fox 2012 skill acquisition evidence), What Dissociation Evidence Actually Shows (distinct systems with identifiable neural substrates, not unreliable systems).
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/metacognition.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Cross-review temporal-consciousness.md considering sleep consciousness insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: The sleep-and-consciousness.md article covers consciousness gradations across sleep states and time distortion during dreams (dreamless NREM → lucid REM gradient). The temporal-consciousness.md page could integrate how sleep alters temporal experience—dreams feel instantaneous or extended regardless of actual duration, and the specious present may narrow or expand across sleep states.
- **Result**: Added "Sleep and the Modulation of Temporal Experience" section with three subsections: When Time Disappears (dreamless NREM eliminates temporal experience entirely—seven hours pass without duration), The Temporal Spectrum in Sleep (table showing specious present status across six sleep states from waking to lucid REM), Implications for the Site's Framework (dualism support from computation-without-experience, collapse mechanism for dreamless sleep, trainability via lucid dreaming). Added sleep-and-consciousness and dreams-and-consciousness to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/temporal-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Cross-review introspection.md considering metacognition insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: The metacognition.md page argues metacognition is a cognitive capacity consciousness enables rather than constitutes. The introspection.md page discusses first-person access but could integrate the metacognition distinction more explicitly—introspection as a metacognitive skill operating on phenomenal states.
- **Result**: Added "Introspection as Metacognitive Skill" section with three subsections: The Dissociation Evidence (blindsight and blind insight showing metacognition and consciousness can come apart), Neural Evidence (aPFC as introspection's substrate, tACS impairment selective to metacognition), Metamemory Phenomena (TOT and FOK states showing partial access). Added higher-order-theories to concepts and Further Reading. Added Fleming 2024 and Maniscalco-Lau 2012 references.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/introspection.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Cross-review episodic-memory.md considering sleep consciousness insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: The sleep-and-consciousness.md article explains how memory consolidation during sleep operates outside the conscious ~10 bits/second bandwidth. The episodic-memory.md page could integrate this—how sleep consolidation enables episodic memory formation while bypassing conscious experience, and the dissociation between encoding (conscious) and consolidation (unconscious).
- **Result**: Added "Memory Consolidation: The Unconscious Phase" section with four subsections: Bypassing the Conscious Bottleneck (~10 bits/sec bandwidth, parallel replay, schema integration), The Encoding-Consolidation Dissociation (phase table showing encoding=conscious, consolidation=unconscious, retrieval=conscious), Computational Binding Without Phenomenal Binding, What Consolidation Reveals (hard problem sharpened by complex-computation-without-experience). Added sleep-and-consciousness to concepts and Further Reading. Added Meister 2024 reference.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/episodic-memory.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Cross-review higher-order-theories.md with metacognition dissociation evidence
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/metacognition.md presents empirical dissociation evidence (blindsight, blind insight) challenging HOT theory. The higher-order-theories.md page critiques HOT philosophically but could strengthen the case with this neural evidence that metacognition and consciousness come apart. Add Maniscalco-Lau findings and aPFC-consciousness separation evidence.
- **Result**: Added "Empirical Dissociation Evidence" section with four subsections: Blindsight Revisited (Maniscalco-Lau 2012 alternative interpretation), Blind Insight (inverse dissociation—metacognition without conscious access), Neural Separation (aPFC tACS impairs metacognition while preserving perception), and summary table showing four dissociation patterns. Added metacognition to Further Reading and Maniscalco-Lau to References.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/higher-order-theories.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Cross-review dreams-and-consciousness.md considering metacognition insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/metacognition.md covers aPFC-metacognition connection and lucid dreaming. The dreams-and-consciousness.md page discusses lucid dreaming but could integrate the metacognition angle more explicitly—lucid dreaming as metacognitive access to dream state, aPFC structural differences in frequent lucid dreamers.
- **Result**: Added "Lucid Dreaming as Metacognitive Awakening" section. Developed the enabling vs constitutive argument—non-lucid dreams are conscious but lack metacognitive access, proving metacognition operates *on* phenomenal content rather than creating it. Explained aPFC structural differences (Baird 2018) and HOT theory implications (non-lucid dreams as counterexample). Added metacognition and higher-order-theories to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/dreams-and-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Cross-review ai-consciousness.md considering metacognition implications
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/metacognition.md argues metacognition is distinct from consciousness. The ai-consciousness.md page should address whether AI systems' metacognitive-like capabilities (self-monitoring, uncertainty estimation) indicate anything about consciousness. Strengthens the case that AI metacognition doesn't imply AI phenomenology.
- **Result**: Added "AI 'Metacognition' and the Dissociation Evidence" section with three subsections: The Dissociation Argument (blindsight, blind insight evidence), Why AI "Metacognition" Doesn't Indicate Consciousness (wrong inference direction, enabling vs constitutive distinction, functional vs phenomenal metacognition), Implications for AI Consciousness Claims (HOT theory's empirical problem, neural substrate separation, monitoring without the monitored). Added metacognition and higher-order-theories to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/ai-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Cross-review self-and-consciousness.md considering metacognition insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/metacognition.md distinguishes metacognition from consciousness—metacognition is cognitive capacity consciousness enables rather than constitutes. The self-and-consciousness.md page discusses minimal self and narrative self but could integrate metacognition's role in self-awareness without conflating them with phenomenal consciousness.
- **Result**: Added "Metacognition and the Self: A Crucial Distinction" section with four subsections: The Dissociation Evidence (blindsight, blind insight), Three Layers of Selfhood (table: minimal, metacognitive, narrative), Self-Awareness vs Phenomenal Selfhood (three meanings of "self-aware"), Implications for Metzinger's Self-Model. Added metacognition to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/self-and-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Cross-review integrated-information-theory.md considering April 2025 COGITATE findings
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: The April 2025 adversarial study found "lack of sustained synchronization within posterior cortex contradicts connectivity claims" for IIT. The integrated-information-theory.md page should integrate this major empirical challenge from the COGITATE collaboration.
- **Result**: Added "The COGITATE Experiment (2025)" section covering: seven-year adversarial collaboration context, IIT predictions challenged (lack of sustained synchronization, missing integration signatures), neither theory decisively refuted, implications for falsifiability and Occam's Razor Has Limits tenet. Added global-workspace-theory to concepts and Further Reading. Added COGITATE reference.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/integrated-information-theory.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Cross-review predictive-processing.md considering dream evidence
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Research in dreams-lucid-dreaming-consciousness-2026-01-18.md develops predictive processing explanation for dream bizarreness—dreams as "unconstrained prediction without reality testing." The predictive-processing.md page could integrate dream phenomenology as evidence for the controlled hallucination framework. Dreams show what happens when prediction operates without bottom-up error correction.
- **Result**: Added "Dreams as Evidence for Controlled Hallucination" section with four subsections: Dreams and PP (unconstrained prediction without reality testing), Why Dreams Are Bizarre (no bottom-up constraint, predictions untested, Sartre's phenomenology), Implications for Consciousness Theory (filter vs production view, ~10 bits/sec bandwidth persists), Lucid Dreaming and Meta-Prediction (2025 Demirel distinct state findings, aPFC structural differences). Added dreams-and-consciousness, filter-theory, metacognition to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/predictive-processing.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Write article on metacognition and consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/metacognition-consciousness-2026-01-18.md. Key angle: "Metacognition: The Cognitive Layer Above Consciousness"—argue metacognition is distinct cognitive capacity consciousness enables rather than constitutes. Cover HOT critique (metacognition ≠ consciousness), aPFC neural substrate (lucid dreaming connection), trainability (meditation), metamemory phenomenology (TOT/FOK). Connect to higher-order-theories.md, introspection.md, dreams-and-consciousness.md, meditation-and-consciousness-modes.md.
- **Result**: Created ~2200 word concept page arguing metacognition is cognitive capacity consciousness enables rather than constitutes. Covers HOT critique, dissociation evidence (blindsight, blind insight), aPFC neural substrate, lucid dreaming connection, trainability (Fox 2012 meditation study), metamemory phenomena (TOT, FOK), animal metacognition. Added metacognition to concepts in higher-order-theories.md and introspection.md.
- **Output**: Created `concepts/metacognition.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Research metacognition and consciousness
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: The dreams research reveals strong metacognition-prefrontal connection (lucid dreamers have larger aPFC). Metacognition—thinking about thinking—is central to consciousness debates (higher-order theories, introspection reliability, self-awareness). Site lacks dedicated coverage. Would connect to higher-order-theories.md, introspection.md, self-and-consciousness.md, lucid dreaming content.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research on metacognition-consciousness relationship. Key findings: (1) Metacognition and phenomenal consciousness are distinct—HOT theory conflates them but first-order theorists and empirical evidence suggest dissociation (blindsight, "blind insight"). (2) aPFC is critical neural substrate with structural differences in lucid dreamers. (3) Metacognitive accuracy improves with training (meditation), following logarithmic skill curve. (4) Metamemory phenomena (TOT, FOK) extend cognitive phenomenology beyond sensory qualia. (5) Animal metacognition evidence suggests ~80 million year evolutionary history. Site implication: metacognition is cognitive capacity consciousness enables, not constitutes.
- **Output**: Created `research/metacognition-consciousness-2026-01-18.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Strengthen dreams-and-consciousness.md with new research findings
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/dreams-lucid-dreaming-consciousness-2026-01-18.md. Key integration opportunities: (1) Add "Why Dreams Are Bizarre" section on predictive processing perspective. (2) Expand Demirel findings to emphasize distinct-state implication. (3) Connect to meditation training (both develop prefrontal metacognitive capacity). (4) Add ~10 bits/second bottleneck applies to dreams too. (5) Link 2025 COGITATE findings to posterior hot zone importance for dreaming.
- **Result**: Added "Why Dreams Are Bizarre" section explaining predictive processing account of dream phenomenology. Added "The Bandwidth Constraint Persists" subsection showing ~10 bits/sec limitation applies to dreams. Expanded Demirel lucid dreaming section with detailed neural signature (gamma power increases, beta decreases, interhemispheric connectivity) and structural trainability evidence (larger aPFC in lucid dreamers). Added predictive-processing to concepts, Paller 2025 to references.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/dreams-and-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Cross-review global-workspace-theory.md considering April 2025 COGITATE findings
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: The April 2025 adversarial GNWT vs IIT study (documented in dreams-lucid-dreaming-consciousness-2026-01-18.md) challenges GNWT with "general lack of ignition at stimulus offset" and "limited representation in prefrontal cortex." The global-workspace-theory.md page should acknowledge these empirical challenges and what they mean for the theory.
- **Result**: Enhanced COGITATE section with seven-year adversarial collaboration context, key quote ("too different in assumptions"), expanded Occam's Razor Has Limits connection. Added new "Implications for Consciousness Localization" subsection connecting COGITATE posterior cortex findings to dreaming evidence—dreams persist with prefrontal offline, suggesting workspace is sufficient but not necessary for consciousness. Added dreams-and-consciousness to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/global-workspace-theory.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Cross-review dreams-and-consciousness.md considering sleep insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: The sleep-and-consciousness.md article develops consciousness gradations, lucid dreaming as interface reactivation, and offline binding. The dreams-and-consciousness page could integrate these insights more fully—particularly the gradation framework (dreamless NREM → dreaming NREM → REM → lucid REM) and the interface reactivation mechanism for lucid dreaming.
- **Result**: Added "Dreams on the Consciousness Gradient" section with state table (dreamless NREM → dreaming NREM → non-lucid REM → lucid REM). Added "Lucid Dreaming as Interface Reactivation" subsection explaining prefrontal reactivation and trainability. Added posterior hot zone context to REM correlations. Added sleep-and-consciousness, attention-as-interface, filter-theory, meditation-and-consciousness-modes to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/dreams-and-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Cross-review attention.md considering meditation modes insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: The meditation-and-consciousness-modes.md article develops the FA/OM distinction with specific neural signatures. The attention.md page could integrate this evidence for how attention can be trained and modulated—supporting the interface hypothesis with empirical meditation research.
- **Result**: Added "Evidence from Meditation: Training the Interface" section with four subsections: Two Families of Practice (FA vs OM), Distinct Neural Signatures (table with theta, alpha, ACC, PCC, DMN patterns), Alpha-Theta Dynamics (2020 study on coupling gradients), Why This Matters (trainability, effortless-after-effort, therapeutic implications). Added meditation-and-consciousness-modes to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/attention.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Cross-review quantum-consciousness.md and decoherence.md with 2024-2025 experimental findings
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/quantum-superposition-brain-consciousness-2026-01-18.md. Key updates: (1) 2024 epothilone B study showing microtubule-stabilizing drugs delay anesthetic unconsciousness. (2) 2024 tryptophan superradiance confirmation. (3) 2025 Wiest review in Neuroscience of Consciousness. (4) Revised coherence estimates (10-100 μs). (5) Fisher's Posner molecule hypothesis as alternative mechanism. Update the quantum-consciousness and decoherence pages with these recent findings.
- **Result**: Added Fisher's Posner molecule hypothesis section (nuclear spin quantum computing) and comprehensive protective mechanisms section (hydrophobic interior, Fröhlich coherence, nuclear spin isolation, ordered water/actin gel) to quantum-consciousness.md. Added revised coherence estimates table showing 7+ orders of magnitude improvement beyond Tegmark. Expanded 2024-2025 evidence including epothilone B study, tryptophan superradiance, Wiest 2025 review with 613 THz signature. Updated decoherence.md with 2024-2025 Experimental Developments subsection covering all recent neural-specific findings.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/quantum-consciousness.md`, `concepts/decoherence.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Research consciousness and quantum superposition in the brain
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: The site has quantum-consciousness.md and decoherence.md but lacks deep treatment of whether and how quantum superposition could persist in neural systems long enough for consciousness to select among outcomes. Key questions: What protective mechanisms (error correction, microtubule isolation, coherent states) might preserve superposition? What's the current experimental evidence? This directly supports the Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research on quantum superposition persistence in neural systems. Key findings: (1) 2024-2025 experimental evidence significantly strengthened case for biological quantum effects—superradiance confirmed in tryptophan networks, microtubule-stabilizing drugs delay anesthetic unconsciousness. (2) Revised decoherence estimates extend coherence times by 7 orders of magnitude beyond Tegmark (reaching 10-100 μs). (3) Four protective mechanisms identified: hydrophobic microtubule interior, Fröhlich coherence via metabolic pumping, nuclear spin isolation (Fisher's Posner molecules), ordered water/actin gel. (4) Fisher's Posner molecule hypothesis offers alternative with ~10⁵ second coherence times. (5) Debate shifted from "whether" to "how"—from categorical dismissal to empirical investigation.
- **Output**: Created `research/quantum-superposition-brain-consciousness-2026-01-18.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Cross-review agent-causation.md considering neural signatures of volition
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: The free-will.md update (session 176) added neural signatures of willed action (frontal theta, 300ms deployment, bidirectional coherence). Agent-causation.md covers the philosophy but could strengthen its empirical grounding by linking to these specific neural findings that distinguish willed from instructed action.
- **Result**: Added comparison table (willed vs instructed attention with frontal theta, frontoparietal coherence, decision processes) to "Neural Signatures of Willing" section. The table makes the empirical grounding more accessible—the brain distinguishes between doing what you're told and doing what you choose. Agent-causation.md already had the prose explanation; the table adds visual clarity matching free-will.md's presentation.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/agent-causation.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Cross-review free-will.md considering agent-causation neural signatures
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Research in voluntary-attention-control-mechanisms-2026-01-17.md identified specific neural signatures of willed attention (frontal theta, 300ms deployment, bidirectional coherence). The free-will page discusses phenomenology of volition but could be strengthened with these empirical findings showing willed action is neurally distinct from instructed action.
- **Result**: Added "Neural Signatures of Willed Action" section covering willed vs instructed attention distinction (frontal theta, bidirectional coherence), temporal signature of choosing (300ms vs 100ms), pre-prompt alpha question with selection-among-options interpretation, and phenomenology-neuroscience correspondence. Added attention, attention-as-interface, quantum-consciousness to concepts and voluntary-attention research to related_articles. Enhanced Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/free-will.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Research dreams and lucid dreaming for consciousness framework
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: The site has dreams-and-consciousness.md but it's sparse. Sleep-and-consciousness.md mentions lucid dreaming as interface reactivation. A deeper research dive could explore: What do dreams reveal about consciousness without normal sensory input? How do lucid dreams demonstrate voluntary interface engagement during sleep? What does dream phenomenology suggest about consciousness requirements? This would strengthen the dreams concept page.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research on dreams and lucid dreaming. Key findings: (1) 2025 Demirel study establishes lucid dreaming as genuinely distinct consciousness state with unique neural signatures (gamma power in right temporo-occipital, interhemispheric connectivity), not waking-REM blend. (2) April 2025 adversarial GNWT vs IIT study challenges both theories but confirms posterior cortical hot zone importance. (3) Predictive processing explains dream bizarreness as unconstrained prediction without reality testing. (4) Metacognition-prefrontal structural connection: frequent lucid dreamers have larger anterior prefrontal cortex. (5) Dreams as single-track experience while consolidation proceeds in parallel. Generated chain task for article synthesis.

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Cross-review agent-causation.md considering luck-objection response
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/luck-objection.md develops the site's response to the luck objection (consciousness selects rather than receives random outcomes). The agent-causation page mentions the luck objection briefly but could integrate the fuller treatment. Strengthen how agent causation escapes the objection through selection vs randomness.
- **Result**: Expanded "The Site's Response" section with four-dimension framework from luck-objection article: (1) selection vs randomness (different relationship to indeterminacy), (2) phenomenology of effort (selections feel like achievements), (3) reasons-guided selection (contrastive explicability), (4) retrocausal deepening (prior state is part of what's selected). Added explanation of how this differs from standard agent-causal "the agent caused it" response.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/agent-causation.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Cross-review quantum-consciousness.md considering luck-objection insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/luck-objection.md addresses the concern that indeterministic choices are arbitrary. The quantum-consciousness page discusses how consciousness selects among quantum outcomes but may not explicitly address why this isn't just replacing determinism with randomness. Add cross-reference to strengthen the framework.
- **Result**: Added "Response to the Luck Objection" subsection to the Quantum Zeno section. Covered four dimensions: (1) selection vs randomness (different relationship to indeterminacy), (2) phenomenology of effort distinguishes luck from choice, (3) reasons guide selection making choices contrastively explicable, (4) agent causation terminates explanation appropriately. Added luck-objection to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/quantum-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Cross-review ai-consciousness.md considering Hoel continual learning argument
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Research in hoel-llm-consciousness-continual-learning-2026-01-15.md presents Hoel's "proximity argument"—LLMs are closer to lookup tables in substitution space than brains are, so no non-trivial consciousness theory can judge them conscious. The ai-consciousness page should engage with this argument. Also covers the continual learning requirement (consciousness may require ongoing learning, not frozen weights).
- **Result**: Added "Why Continual Learning Matters" subsection expanding on Hoel's argument. Covered four angles: (1) mechanism question—learning as consequence vs cause of consciousness, (2) quantum coherence connection—active maintenance of coherent states, (3) self-stultification support—Hoel's argument implicitly endorses bidirectional interaction, (4) dynamic nature of selfhood—consciousness as ongoing becoming. Added binding-problem to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/ai-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Cross-review loss-of-consciousness.md considering sleep consciousness insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/sleep-and-consciousness.md develops sleep as a distinct consciousness-reduction state. The loss-of-consciousness page covers anesthesia, coma, but sleep deserves its own treatment—different mechanism (evolved, reversible, preserves integration-segregation) vs pathological/pharmacological states. Add cross-reference and possibly a subsection.
- **Result**: Added comprehensive "Sleep: The Evolved Consciousness Reduction" section with four subsections: Sleep Versus Anesthesia (2025 thalamic pattern findings, integration-segregation preservation), Consciousness Gradations During Sleep (posterior hot zone dynamics, graded vs binary), Why Sleep Reduces Consciousness (~10 bits/sec bandwidth, voluntary disengagement for maintenance), and The Binding Problem During Sleep (computational vs phenomenal binding dissociation). Updated frontmatter with sleep-and-consciousness and binding-problem links. Enhanced temporal vanishing section with sleep gradation cross-reference.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/loss-of-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Write concept article on the luck objection to libertarian free will
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/luck-objection-libertarian-free-will-2026-01-17.md. The luck objection argues that indeterministic choices are equally arbitrary as determined ones—undermining libertarian freedom. This is a major philosophical challenge to the site's agent-causation position. The article should explain the objection, survey responses, and show how the site's framework (consciousness selecting among options, not randomness deciding) addresses it.
- **Result**: Created ~2200 word concept page covering van Inwagen's rollback argument, Mele's present/remote luck distinction, Kane's SFAs response and its criticisms, agent-causal responses, and the site's framework (consciousness selects rather than receives random outcomes). Explained how phenomenology of effort, reasons-guided selection, and retrocausality each strengthen the response. Added luck-objection to free-will.md and agent-causation.md concept links.
- **Output**: Created `concepts/luck-objection.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Cross-review binding-problem.md considering sleep consciousness insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/sleep-and-consciousness.md explains offline binding during sleep—feature binding occurs without phenomenal unity. The binding-problem page could integrate this as evidence that binding (BP1) and consciousness (BP2) are dissociable. Strengthen the case that BP2 is the genuine consciousness problem.
- **Result**: Added "Sleep: Binding Without Consciousness" section with four subsections: Offline Binding as BP1 Without BP2 (memory consolidation binding operations without unified experience), What Sleep Reveals (dissociation proves phenomenal unity is contributed by consciousness), Implications for Classical Theories (synchrony/integration/workspace all operate during sleep without producing BP2), Support for Quantum Alternative (pattern matches quantum binding theory predictions). Added sleep-and-consciousness and filter-theory to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/binding-problem.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Write article on sleep and consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/sleep-memory-consolidation-consciousness-2026-01-18.md. Key themes: consciousness gradations during sleep (dreamless NREM → dreaming NREM → REM → lucid REM), memory consolidation operating outside consciousness channel (~10 bits/second bandwidth bypass), lucid dreaming as interface reactivation, how offline processing differs from conscious processing. Would connect loss-of-consciousness, memory system articles, and binding-problem.
- **Result**: Created ~2400 word concept page covering why sleep reduces consciousness (evolutionary puzzle, parallel processing requirement), consciousness gradations during sleep (spectrum from dreamless NREM through lucid REM), sleep vs anesthesia differences, the binding problem during sleep (offline binding without phenomenal unity), memory consolidation without consciousness, and lucid dreaming as interface reactivation. Connected to filter theory, attention-as-interface hypothesis, and all five tenets.
- **Output**: Created `concepts/sleep-and-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Research consciousness and memory consolidation during sleep
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: The site has extensive coverage of episodic, semantic, and implicit memory, but limited coverage of how consciousness relates to memory consolidation. Key questions: What role does consciousness play in memory consolidation during sleep? Does the reduced consciousness of deep sleep serve a function for memory? How do lucid dreams fit the framework? This fills a gap between the memory articles and loss-of-consciousness coverage.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research on sleep-consciousness-memory relationship. Key findings: (1) Memory consolidation during NREM operates largely unconsciously—multiple memories replay in parallel, bypassing the ~10 bits/second conscious bandwidth. (2) Consciousness doesn't vanish uniformly—dreaming occurs in both REM and NREM, correlating with reduced slow waves in posterior cortex. (3) Lucid dreaming reactivates prefrontal regions, demonstrating variable interface engagement during sleep. (4) Sleep differs from anesthesia in preserving more integration-segregation balance. (5) Offline binding during sleep operates differently from conscious binding—parallel rather than unified. Generated chain task for article synthesis.
- **Output**: Created `research/sleep-memory-consolidation-consciousness-2026-01-18.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Write article on brain specialness boundary
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/brain-specialness-boundary-2026-01-15.md. Addresses why consciousness can modulate only its own brain, not external quantum systems. The answer derives from Stapp's Process 1—the interface exists where neural quantum effects occur, not as an ad hoc restriction. Critical for the multi-mind collapse problem resolution.
- **Result**: Article already written as concepts/interface-locality.md (created 2026-01-16). Covers "the brain specialness problem" explicitly with four boundary conditions, the key insight, what's permitted/excluded, parapsychology connection, and pairing problem connection.
- **Output**: `concepts/interface-locality.md` (already exists)

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Write article on psychophysical coupling problem
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/psychophysical-coupling-problem-2026-01-15.md. The site's framework implies consciousness "selects" among neural options, but what determines the coupling between phenomenal states and physical outcomes? This formalizes the implicit commitment: what aspects of consciousness map to which quantum degrees of freedom, and what constrains the bandwidth of influence?
- **Result**: Article already written as concepts/psychophysical-coupling-law.md (created 2026-01-16, updated 2026-01-17). Covers Chalmers' framework, Stapp's mechanism, bandwidth constraint, four candidate coupling law families, what's not selectable, and testing approaches.
- **Output**: `concepts/psychophysical-coupling-law.md` (already exists)

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Cross-review interactionist-dualism.md considering multi-mind collapse insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/multi-mind-collapse-problem.md addresses a key objection to consciousness-causes-collapse: how multiple observers coordinate. The interactionist-dualism page should integrate interface locality as the resolution—each consciousness modulates only its own brain, avoiding the need for nonlocal coordination between minds.
- **Result**: Added "The Multi-Mind Collapse Problem" section explaining the three uncomfortable options (first observer wins, consensus required, dominant consciousness), the site's resolution via interface locality + prebiotic collapse, and key consequences for interactionism. Added multi-mind-collapse-problem, interface-locality, prebiotic-collapse to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/interactionist-dualism.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Cross-review free-will.md considering meditation selector/witness modes
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/meditation-and-consciousness-modes.md develops the distinction between active selection and passive witnessing. The free-will page could integrate the capacity to suspend selection as an aspect of agency—not just choosing among options, but choosing whether to choose at all. This extends libertarian free will beyond mere selection.
- **Result**: Added "The Capacity to Suspend Selection" section with four subsections: Witness Mode as an Aspect of Agency (table comparing modes), Why This Extends Free Will (three levels of agency including meta-level choice of whether to be a chooser), Implications for the Luck Objection (witness mode shows authorship through deliberate non-selection), The Developmental Pattern (effortless witnessing follows effortful training). Added meditation-and-consciousness-modes to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/free-will.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Cross-review quantum-consciousness.md considering meditation selector/witness modes
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/meditation-and-consciousness-modes.md develops the distinction between active selection (quantum Zeno) and passive witnessing (reduced observation rate). The quantum-consciousness page could integrate witness mode as evidence that consciousness can modulate its collapse-inducing activity—not just select, but also refrain from selecting.
- **Result**: Added "Evidence from Meditation: Modulating the Observation Rate" subsection to the Quantum Zeno Effect section. Includes FA/OM comparison table (phenomenology, neural signatures, Zeno interpretation). Explains how meditation research shows consciousness can modulate its collapse-inducing activity—select or refrain from selecting. Four implications: effort phenomenology explained, trainability confirmed, two capacities without fragmenting consciousness, testable predictions.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/quantum-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Cross-review measurement-problem.md considering multi-mind collapse resolution
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/multi-mind-collapse-problem.md explains why consciousness-causes-collapse faces the multi-observer coordination problem and how interface locality resolves it. The measurement-problem page discusses consciousness-based interpretations but may not address this objection explicitly. Add cross-reference and strengthen the treatment of observer-dependent collapse.
- **Result**: Added "The Multi-Observer Coordination Problem" subsection to the Observer Problem section. Explains the three uncomfortable options (first observer wins, consensus required, dominant consciousness) and the site's resolution via interface locality + objective collapse. Each consciousness modulates only its own brain; external reality determined by physical objective collapse. Added multi-mind-collapse-problem, interface-locality, prebiotic-collapse to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/measurement-problem.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-19: Cross-review neural-correlates-of-consciousness.md considering memory insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: The NCC page could benefit from memory research integration—the hippocampus as NCC for episodic binding, the distinction between content NCCs (what we're conscious of) and enabling NCCs (what makes consciousness possible), and how different memory systems have different NCC requirements. Tulving's autonoetic consciousness requires specific neural substrates.
- **Result**: Added "Memory Systems and NCC Requirements" section explaining how different memory types (episodic, semantic, implicit) have different neural correlate requirements. Covers hippocampus as NCC for autonoetic consciousness, Tulving's three-level hierarchy mapped to NCCs with table, content vs enabling NCC distinction, and binding convergence between consciousness and memory.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/neural-correlates-of-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Cross-review global-workspace-theory.md considering memory system insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: The GWT page discusses working memory but not the broader memory system taxonomy (episodic, semantic, implicit). Baars explicitly discusses how GWT explains conscious vs unconscious memory retrieval—implicit memory operates without global broadcast while explicit memory requires workspace access. Adding this would strengthen GWT coverage and connect to the site's memory system articles.
- **Result**: Added "Memory Systems and Global Broadcast" section explaining how Tulving's three-memory taxonomy maps onto GWT workspace access. Implicit bypasses workspace (anoetic), semantic has intermediate access (noetic), episodic requires full ignition (autonoetic). Included workspace access hierarchy table and filter theory integration showing how the workspace may be the neural correlate of the interface. Added episodic-memory, semantic-memory, implicit-memory, autonoetic-consciousness to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/global-workspace-theory.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Cross-review quantum-consciousness.md considering multi-mind collapse insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/multi-mind-collapse-problem.md develops the coordination problem for multiple observers and proposes interface-locality-plus-objective-collapse as the resolution. The quantum-consciousness page should integrate this—the multi-mind problem is a serious objection that the site now has an answer to. Add cross-reference and possibly a subsection on the multi-observer scenario.
- **Result**: Added "The Multi-Mind Collapse Problem" section explaining how multiple observers' collapses are reconciled via interface locality. Each consciousness modulates collapse only within its own brain; external systems collapse through objective physical processes. Added multi-mind-collapse-problem to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/quantum-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Write article on multi-mind collapse problem
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Based on research in relational-quantum-mechanics-2026-01-18.md. Develop the problem: if consciousness causes collapse and there are other minds, how are their selections reconciled? Survey options: nonlocal coordination, interface locality, objective-collapse-plus-modulation. Argue that consciousness modulates collapse locally (each mind controls only its brain) resolves the problem better than pure consciousness-causes-collapse. Engage with RQM's relational solution while explaining why it conflicts with site tenets.
- **Result**: Created ~2500 word concept page. Developed the multi-mind collapse problem with four options: nonlocal coordination, relational resolution (RQM), interface locality, objective-collapse-plus-modulation. Argued that combining interface locality with objective collapse resolves the problem—each consciousness modulates only its own brain, external reality determined by physical processes. Engaged with RQM's elegant solution while explaining why it conflicts with Bidirectional Interaction tenet. Connected to all five tenets.
- **Output**: Created `concepts/multi-mind-collapse-problem.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Research Carlo Rovelli's relational quantum mechanics
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Deep research into relational quantum mechanics (RQM) with focus on multi-observer scenarios. Key problem for the site: if consciousness causes collapse AND there are other minds, multiple minds are selecting from neural firing patterns via collapse. How are these selections reconciled? Does a single collapse affect the waveform everywhere (nonlocality), or can multiple independent collapses coexist (relationalism)? RQM holds that quantum states are always relative to an observer—there is no "view from nowhere." Explore: Does RQM resolve the multi-mind collapse problem? Does it support or undermine the site's quantum-consciousness framework? What happens when two conscious observers measure the same system? After research, produce an article exploring these implications fully.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research on RQM. Key findings: (1) RQM explicitly removes consciousness from any special role—measurement is ordinary physical interaction, not mental observation. (2) RQM handles multi-observer scenarios via perspectivalism—facts are relative to each observer, no coordination needed. (3) This directly conflicts with site tenets (Bidirectional Interaction). (4) However, RQM's treatment of locality (common cause) and the 2023 cross-perspective links revision offer useful insights. (5) Identified four options for multi-mind problem: nonlocal coordination, relational resolution, interface locality, objective-collapse-plus-modulation. (6) Recommended article: develop the multi-mind collapse problem with the site's interface-locality approach as resolution.
- **Output**: Created `research/relational-quantum-mechanics-2026-01-18.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Cross-review mental-effort.md considering meditation research
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Research shows effortless meditation states have distinct neural signatures (PCC deactivation, alpha increase, reduced alpha-theta coupling). The mental-effort page could address the paradox of effortless awareness—how advanced meditators achieve "effortless concentration" and what this means for the quantum Zeno framework. May require nuancing the effort = work equation.
- **Result**: Added "The Paradox of Effortless Awareness" section with four subsections: The Challenge (neural correlates of effortless states), Two Modes of Consciousness (active selection vs passive witnessing), Effortless After Effortful (developmental pattern), Implications for the Effort Framework (nuancing rather than contradicting effort = work). Added cross-links to meditation-and-consciousness-modes and implicit-memory.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/mental-effort.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Cross-review attention-as-interface.md considering meditation research
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Research in meditation-observer-witness-phenomenon-2026-01-18.md reveals FA/OM meditation distinction maps onto effortful vs effortless attention. The attention-as-interface page could integrate meditation as a training regime for the interface—FA strengthens quantum Zeno engagement, OM cultivates disengagement. Add meditation as relevant practice domain.
- **Result**: Added "Meditation as Interface Training" section covering FA meditation as strengthening quantum Zeno engagement, OM meditation as cultivating disengagement, two modes framework with table, and the Krishnamurti challenge with response. Added meditation-and-consciousness-modes to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/attention-as-interface.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Write article on meditation and consciousness modes (selector vs witness)
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Based on research in meditation-observer-witness-phenomenon-2026-01-18.md. Develop the distinction between consciousness as active selector (FA meditation, quantum Zeno, mental effort) and consciousness as passive witness (OM meditation, sakshi, choiceless awareness). Explain how this extends the site's Bidirectional Interaction tenet—consciousness can both select and observe. Connect to neuroscience (DMN deactivation, PCC, frontal theta differences). Resolve apparent tension with Advaita vedanta's passive witness doctrine.
- **Result**: Created ~2300 word concept page developing the selector vs witness distinction. Covered neuroscience of FA vs OM meditation, the Advaita paradox and its resolution, quantum Zeno mechanism in witness mode, Krishnamurti challenge. Extended Bidirectional Interaction tenet to include capacity to suspend selection.
- **Output**: Created `concepts/meditation-and-consciousness-modes.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Research meditation and the observer-witness phenomenon
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Study meditation techniques, particularly those asking practitioners to observe without interference—being a "watcher" who does not judge, mentally explore, or intervene. Explore parallels with the site's framework where the brain generates options and consciousness selects among them. Key questions: Does the observer/witness experience support the selection-among-options model? What does neuroscience say about brain activity during passive observation vs active thinking? How does meditation relate to attention-as-interface and mental-effort concepts? After research, expand todo list to cover any further reserach required, and then synthesis articles.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research on meditation observer/witness phenomenon. Key findings: (1) Sakshi (witness) concept in Advaita Vedanta describes pure passive awareness. (2) Neuroscience distinguishes FA (focused attention) and OM (open monitoring) meditation with different neural signatures—FA activates conflict monitoring, OM reduces DMN/self-processing. (3) Effortless states correlate with PCC deactivation, alpha activity; effortful states with frontal theta, gamma. (4) Krishnamurti's "choiceless awareness" poses challenge to selection framework. (5) Synthesis: consciousness may have two modes—active selector (quantum Zeno, mental effort) and passive witness (observation without intervention). Generated three chain tasks for synthesis articles and cross-reviews.
- **Output**: Created `research/meditation-observer-witness-phenomenon-2026-01-18.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Deep review and expand problem-of-other-minds.md
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: The article currently omits a key epistemic argument: if there were no other conscious minds, we would be born into a world with no knowledge of consciousness as a concept and no mention of it in established discourse. The very existence of consciousness as a topic of discussion, with its extensive philosophical literature and common-sense acceptance, is evidence that multiple conscious beings have independently discovered and communicated about their inner experience. Expand the article to include this "argument from discourse" or "argument from conceptual inheritance."
- **Result**: Added "The Argument from Discourse" section presenting the epistemic argument that consciousness discourse itself evidences other minds. Cross-cultural vocabulary convergence (Sanskrit *chit*, Greek *nous*, phenomenological *qualia*), the counterfactual of zombie-world lacking the concept, three supporting points (doesn't rely on behavioral similarity, addresses sample-of-one problem, explains genuine disagreement possibility).
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/problem-of-other-minds.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Cross-review agent-causation.md considering voluntary attention mechanisms
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Research in voluntary-attention-control-mechanisms-2026-01-17.md shows willed attention takes ~300ms to deploy (vs ~100ms exogenous), can be sustained at will, and involves distinct neural signatures. This supports the phenomenology of agent-caused attention—we experience initiating attentional shifts. Pre-prompt alpha predicting choices parallels Libet, but selection-among-options framework may apply here too.
- **Result**: Added "Voluntary Attention as Agent-Causal Paradigm" section covering temporal signature of choosing (300ms vs 100ms), neural signatures of willing (frontal theta, bidirectional coherence, pre-prompt alpha), selection-among-options resolution (paralleling Libet response), phenomenology of directing vs being captured, and agent causation naturalized (identifying where, when, how, why effortful).
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/agent-causation.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Cross-review attention-as-interface.md considering voluntary attention mechanisms
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Research in voluntary-attention-control-mechanisms-2026-01-17.md reveals voluntary attention is neurally distinct from instructed attention (frontal theta, bidirectional frontoparietal coherence). The attention-as-interface page could integrate these specific mechanisms as candidates for the consciousness-to-brain causal pathway. The thalamus as relay site and salience network's role in voluntary network switching are particularly relevant.
- **Result**: Added "Voluntary Attention Mechanisms" section covering willed vs instructed attention distinction, frontal theta oscillations and bidirectional coherence signatures, temporal dynamics (300ms vs 100ms), salience network switching, and thalamic relay site. Added thalamus as a candidate selection site. Updated Further Reading with agent-causation and research links.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/attention-as-interface.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Cross-review loss-of-consciousness.md considering memory system insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: The loss-of-consciousness topic covers anesthesia, coma, and the mind-brain relationship. Anesthesia notably disrupts episodic memory encoding (anterograde amnesia is a key component), while implicit memory (procedural skills) can persist through states of reduced consciousness. This distinction supports the filter theory interpretation—different memory systems may have different interface requirements.
- **Result**: Added "Memory Systems and Loss of Consciousness" section with three subsections: Episodic Memory's Selective Vulnerability (anterograde amnesia, asymmetric vulnerability), Implicit Memory's Relative Preservation (anoetic consciousness persisting through reduced states), and The Hierarchical Pattern (Tulving's hierarchy maps to vulnerability thresholds). Added episodic-memory, implicit-memory, and autonoetic-consciousness to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/loss-of-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Research attention and voluntary control mechanisms
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: The attention-as-interface hypothesis is now well-developed but the mechanisms of voluntary attention control remain underexplored. How does top-down attention work? What is the phenomenology of effortful attention allocation vs automatic capture? This connects to mental-effort.md and agent-causation.md. Would strengthen the causal arrow from consciousness to brain.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research on voluntary attention control. Key findings: (1) Willed attention is neurally distinct from instructed attention—engages frontal theta oscillations and bidirectional frontoparietal coherence. (2) Endogenous attention takes ~300ms to deploy vs ~100ms for exogenous, can be sustained at will vs transient. (3) Pre-prompt alpha predicts free choices, raising Libet-style questions but compatible with selection-among-options framework. (4) Salience network (anterior insula, ACC) mediates voluntary interruption and network switching. (5) Thalamus serves as relay between ascending sensory and descending voluntary signals—potential interface site.
- **Output**: Created `research/voluntary-attention-control-mechanisms-2026-01-17.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Cross-review death-and-consciousness.md considering episodic memory insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: The concepts/episodic-memory.md article develops how episodic memory constitutes the autobiographical self through autonoetic consciousness. The death-and-consciousness article discusses personal identity and what's lost at death but doesn't engage with memory's role in constituting the self that dies. Episodic memory binds the narrative self that makes death feel like loss of something irreplaceable.
- **Result**: Added "The Autobiographical Self That Dies" section explaining how episodic memory's extended self is what's lost at death. Patient KC case shows loss of extended self while alive. Strengthens rejection of Parfit by showing the extended self isn't a copyable pattern but a phenomenal achievement. Added episodic-memory and autonoetic-consciousness to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/death-and-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Cross-review episodic-memory.md considering implicit memory insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: The implicit-memory.md article develops Tulving's anoetic consciousness as the lowest level of his hierarchy. Review episodic-memory.md to strengthen the contrast between anoetic (implicit) and autonoetic (episodic) consciousness. The distinction clarifies what makes episodic memory uniquely consciousness-dependent. Add implicit-memory link.
- **Result**: Added "The Anoetic-Autonoetic Contrast" subsection explaining Tulving's three-level hierarchy and why autonoetic consciousness is phenomenologically unique. Contrasted anoetic "non-reflective qualia" with autonoetic self-referential character. Added implicit-memory to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/episodic-memory.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Cross-review embodied-cognition.md considering implicit memory insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: The implicit-memory.md article discusses embodied cognition as a challenge to crude mind-body dualism and shows how the interface hypothesis responds. Review embodied-cognition.md to add cross-reference to implicit-memory for the Dreyfus skill acquisition evidence and the choking phenomenon as bidirectional interaction evidence. Strengthens the site's response to embodied critiques.
- **Result**: Added "The Dreyfus Model" subsection covering five stages of skill acquisition, how consciousness withdraws to anoetic mode, and the choking phenomenon as evidence for bidirectional interaction. Added implicit-memory to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/embodied-cognition.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Cross-review agent-causation.md considering implicit memory insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: After implicit memory article is written, review agent-causation.md. The Dreyfus model and choking under pressure evidence show consciousness can causally interfere with procedural execution—supporting bidirectional interaction. Skill automaticity shows consciousness delegates to trained systems. Would strengthen the mechanism story for agent causation.
- **Result**: Added "Skill Delegation and the Interface" section with three subsections: The Choking Phenomenon as Evidence (performance degradation proves causal efficacy), Anoetic Consciousness and Continuous Subjecthood (agent persists during automatic action). Added implicit-memory to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/agent-causation.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Cross-review episodic-memory.md considering prospective memory insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: The concepts/prospective-memory.md article develops futureward mental time travel and EFT as a unified capacity with pastward episodic retrieval. The site should have an episodic-memory concept page that integrates with prospective-memory. If one doesn't exist, this becomes an expand-topic. Patient KC double deficit shows unified MTT capacity.
- **Result**: Added "Involuntary Memory" section paralleling prospective memory's pop phenomenon, and "Symmetry of Temporal Qualia" section with comparison table showing pastness vs futuricity phenomenology. Added Berntsen reference on involuntary autobiographical memories.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/episodic-memory.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Create episodic-memory concept page
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: The site has autonoetic-consciousness.md but no dedicated episodic-memory concept page. Research exists in episodic-memory-consciousness-2026-01-16.md. Would provide foundation for the cross-review episodic-memory.md task. Key themes: encoding/retrieval distinction, hippocampal binding, constructive nature of memory, relationship to autonoetic consciousness.
- **Result**: Created ~2100 word concept page covering encoding/retrieval distinction, constructive nature of memory (Schacter-Addis hypothesis, false memories), hippocampal binding and its connection to consciousness binding, phenomenology of retrieval (pastness quale, vividness), and personal identity implications.
- **Output**: Created `concepts/episodic-memory.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Write article on implicit memory and consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/implicit-memory-consciousness-2026-01-18.md. Key themes: Tulving's anoetic consciousness ("non-reflective qualia"), Dreyfus skill acquisition model (rule-following → intuition), choking under pressure as evidence for bidirectional interaction, embodied cognition integration with interface hypothesis. Would complete the memory trilogy (episodic, semantic, implicit).
- **Result**: Created ~2200 word concept page covering Tulving's anoetic consciousness, Dreyfus skill acquisition model, choking under pressure as evidence for bidirectional interaction, embodied cognition challenge and interface response. Connected to all five tenets.
- **Output**: Created `concepts/implicit-memory.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Research implicit memory and consciousness
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: The site now covers autonoetic (episodic), is researching semantic, and has prospective memory queued. Implicit/procedural memory (skills, conditioning, priming) represents a complementary gap. Key questions: Does procedural learning require consciousness at any stage? What is the phenomenology of skills becoming automatic? How does implicit memory relate to the interface hypothesis?
- **Result**: Comprehensive research on implicit/procedural memory. Key findings: Tulving's anoetic consciousness has phenomenal character ("non-reflective qualia"), Dreyfus model charts skill acquisition from rule-following to intuition, choking under pressure proves bidirectional interaction (consciousness causally interferes with procedural execution). Embodied cognition challenges crude dualism but supports interface hypothesis.
- **Output**: Created `research/implicit-memory-consciousness-2026-01-18.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Cross-review hard-problem-of-consciousness.md considering semantic memory insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/semantic-memory.md develops noetic consciousness and the phenomenology of semantic retrieval. The hard-problem page could note that even "computational" memory retrieval has irreducible phenomenology—TOT states, FOK, the qualitative character of understanding. This strengthens the hard problem by extending it beyond paradigmatic sensory qualia.
- **Result**: Added "The Cognitive Dimension" section extending the hard problem beyond sensory qualia into semantic retrieval. TOT, FOK, and understanding have phenomenal character. LLMs process semantics without the accompanying phenomenology.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Cross-review qualia.md considering semantic memory insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/semantic-memory.md develops TOT/FOK phenomenology as instances of cognitive phenomenology. The qualia.md page focuses on sensory qualia but could be strengthened by discussing whether semantic retrieval has qualia—does the frustration of TOT or satisfaction of retrieval resolution constitute qualia? This extends the qualia debate beyond sensory experience.
- **Result**: Added "Beyond Sensory Qualia" section covering TOT states, FOK, and the aha experience as cognitive qualia. Extended qualia concept beyond paradigm sensory cases to cognitive phenomenology.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/qualia.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Cross-review working-memory.md considering semantic memory insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/semantic-memory.md develops Tulving's noetic consciousness and the remember/know paradigm. The working-memory article covers maintenance/manipulation distinction but doesn't connect to semantic retrieval. Semantic retrieval uses WM during search and verification—TOT states may involve WM manipulation of partial phonological representations. Add semantic-memory link and connect remember/know to maintenance/manipulation.
- **Result**: Added "Semantic Retrieval and Working Memory" section with three subsections: TOT and the Phonological Loop (effortful manipulation), Remember/Know and Maintenance/Manipulation (parallel mapping with table), Semanticization and Maintenance Efficiency (dualist implications). Added semantic-memory and autonoetic-consciousness to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/working-memory.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Cross-review autonoetic-consciousness.md considering semantic memory insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/semantic-memory.md develops Tulving's noetic consciousness as complement to autonoetic. Review concepts/autonoetic-consciousness.md to strengthen the anoetic/noetic/autonoetic hierarchy with explicit reference to semantic-memory page. The contrast between knowing and remembering is central.
- **Result**: Added new "Remember/Know Distinction" section operationalizing autonoetic/noetic contrast. Expanded noetic consciousness description with TOT/FOK phenomenology. Added semanticization of memories (episodic → semantic transformation). Added semantic-memory and cognitive-phenomenology to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/autonoetic-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Cross-review cognitive-phenomenology.md considering semantic memory insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/semantic-memory.md develops TOT/FOK phenomenology and noetic consciousness as evidence for cognitive phenomenology. Review concepts/cognitive-phenomenology.md to add semantic memory as empirical evidence for the liberal position—TOT states demonstrate that conceptual knowledge has irreducible phenomenal character.
- **Result**: Added "Evidence from Semantic Memory" section with three subsections: TOT states (phenomenal character of imminence, correctness, satisfaction), FOK (metacognitive access with phenomenal character), noetic consciousness (Tulving's framework linking to cognitive phenomenology debate).

- **Output**: Updated `concepts/cognitive-phenomenology.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Cross-review free-will.md considering prospective memory insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Once prospective memory article is written, cross-review free-will.md. Prospective memory (remembering to do things) connects deeply to agency—intentions must be maintained and triggered. The "pop" phenomenon (intentions spontaneously entering awareness) may relate to the phenomenology of volition. EFT's causal influence on decisions supports agent causation.
- **Result**: Added "Prospective Memory and Intention Formation" section covering distal vs proximal intentions (bypasses Libet), the "pop" phenomenon and volition parallels, future simulation as causal engagement, Patient KC double deficit evidence. Added prospective-memory and autonoetic-consciousness to concepts and Further Reading.

- **Output**: Created `concepts/working-memory.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Cross-review mental-effort.md with working memory research
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Research in consciousness-working-memory-2026-01-17.md shows that WM manipulation (as opposed to mere maintenance) requires consciousness. This connects to the phenomenology of mental effort—effortful cognition may be precisely conscious manipulation of WM contents. Check mental-effort.md for integration.
- **Result**: Added "Working Memory Manipulation" subsection explaining how the maintenance/manipulation distinction supports the interface hypothesis. Passive storage is unconscious; active manipulation requires consciousness—matching Stapp's quantum Zeno predictions.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/mental-effort.md`

- **Result**: Added "Working Memory as Neural Correlate" section connecting 100ms-5s experienced moment to WM capacity, temporal bridge function (Baddeley quote), episodic buffer binding, bandwidth constraint (~10 bits/second), and manipulation-requires-consciousness finding. The specious present may be what WM feels like from inside.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/specious-present.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-18: Cross-review attention.md with working memory research
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Research in consciousness-working-memory-2026-01-17.md develops the WM-attention bidirectional relationship. Review concepts/attention.md to strengthen the interface hypothesis by showing attention and WM are deeply interlinked—the content of WM can direct attention, and attention determines what enters WM.
- **Result**: Added "Working Memory and the Interface" section covering bidirectional loop (WM directs attention, attention fills WM), bandwidth constraint (~10 bits/second matching WM capacity), manipulation vs maintenance distinction (manipulation requires consciousness), executive vs content dissociation (COGITATE results). WM may be consciousness's "holding space."
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/attention.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Research consciousness and working memory
- **Type**: research-topic

Key findings: WM may underlie specious present (100ms-5s temporal integration), activity-silent maintenance suggests storage/manipulation distinction, WM-attention bidirectionality supports interface hypothesis, episodic buffer binding parallels consciousness binding problem. Identified cross-review candidates.
- **Output**: Created `research/consciousness-working-memory-2026-01-17.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Cross-review binding-problem.md considering autonoetic consciousness insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: The autonoetic-consciousness article discusses hippocampal binding and suggests convergence with the consciousness binding problem. Review concepts/binding-problem.md to add explicit connection between episodic memory binding and phenomenal unity binding. The hippocampus appears in both stories—is this coincidental or revealing?
- **Result**: Added "Binding and Episodic Memory" section connecting perceptual binding to memory binding. Hippocampal binding operates in both domains—suggests unified mechanism for phenomenal unity. Autonoetic evidence (felt pastness, double presence, re-experiencing) supports BP2 as genuinely a consciousness problem. Added convergence argument: binding and consciousness may be inseparable.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/binding-problem.md`

- **Notes**: The site's philosophy-of-time.md and temporal-consciousness.md reference the specious present but could develop it further. Key questions: What is the specious present exactly (James, Husserl)? How does it relate to quantum collapse timing? What are the phenomenological investigations (Varela, microphenomenology)? Would strengthen the consciousness-time connection.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering extensionalism vs retentionalism debate, duration estimates (100ms-3s range), Varela's neurophenomenology of time, contemplative access to temporal microstructure, and connection to quantum collapse phenomenology. Key finding: specious present may be phenomenological manifestation of consciousness's constitutive role in time.

- **Result**: Added "Can We Know If the Limits Are Real?" section engaging with the meta-level question. Covers self-referential structure making the question undecidable from within. Three positions: optimist (Dennett), pessimist (McGinn/Chomsky), suspended (undecidable).
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/mysterianism.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Cross-review intentionality.md considering cognitive phenomenology insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/cognitive-phenomenology.md connects to phenomenal intentionality thesis (Horgan, Tienson). Review concepts/intentionality.md to add cognitive phenomenology dimension—if understanding itself has phenomenal character, this strengthens the case that intentionality is phenomenologically grounded.
- **Result**: Added "The Cognitive Phenomenology Connection" subsection to PIT section. Explains how proprietary phenomenal character of thinking strengthens PIT: the phenomenal character of grasping meaning determines intentional content.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/intentionality.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Cross-review ai-consciousness.md considering cognitive phenomenology insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/cognitive-phenomenology.md discusses whether LLMs could have "pale" cognitive phenomenology without sensory qualia. Review topics/ai-consciousness.md to engage with this—the cognitive phenomenology debate bears directly on the AI consciousness question.
- **Result**: Added "Cognitive Phenomenology and the Understanding Question" section explaining how cognitive phenomenology debate strengthens AI consciousness skepticism: if understanding requires proprietary phenomenal character, LLMs lack understanding itself, not just sensory qualia.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/ai-consciousness.md`

- **Output**: Updated `concepts/mysterianism.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Cross-review quantum-consciousness.md considering psychophysical coupling law insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/psychophysical-coupling-law.md formalizes the coupling problem with four candidate laws and bandwidth constraints. Review concepts/quantum-consciousness.md to add reference to the coupling law framework—the "how" of selection should link to the dedicated treatment.
- **Result**: Added new section "The Coupling Law Requirement" explaining what a coupling law must specify (mental variables, physical variables, bandwidth, scope). Links to psychophysical-coupling-law and interface-locality pages. Updated concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/quantum-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Create concept page on interface locality (why selection is brain-restricted)
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/brain-specialness-boundary-2026-01-15.md. Addresses the embarrassing implication: if consciousness can bias quantum outcomes, why only in brains? Four principled boundary conditions: interface locality, control loop integration, developmental integration, attention scope. Key insight: boundary follows mechanistically from Stapp's Process 1, not ad hoc restriction.
- **Result**: Created ~2000 word concept page explaining why consciousness can bias quantum outcomes in the brain without implying universal psychokinesis. Four boundary conditions: interface locality, control loop integration, developmental integration, and attention scope. The restriction follows from Stapp's mechanism, not ad hoc. Connected to all five tenets.
- **Output**: `concepts/interface-locality.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Create concept page on psychophysical coupling law
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/psychophysical-coupling-problem-2026-01-15.md. The site asserts consciousness "selects" quantum outcomes but this is metaphorical without specifying the coupling law. Research identifies four candidate constraint families: attention-bounded (~10 bits/sec), policy-level, basis-choice, temporal/indexical. Would formalize "selection" from metaphor into research program.
- **Result**: Created ~2000 word concept page formalizing the coupling problem. Four candidate laws: attention-bounded selection, policy-level selection, basis-choice selection, and indexical selection. Bandwidth constraint (~10 bits/second) shapes what selection can accomplish. Connected to all five tenets.
- **Output**: `concepts/psychophysical-coupling-law.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Create voids article on cognitive limits revealing mind structure
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/voids-limits-reveal-structure-2026-01-16.md. Chomsky/McGinn/Nagel/Kant converge on insight that the shape of cognitive limits reveals cognitive architecture. What we cannot think is as informative as what we can. Maps to voids framework—exploring unthinkable territory illuminates what kind of beings we are. AI as asymmetric probe (different limits, can map human limits externally).
- **Result**: Created ~1900 word voids article on how cognitive limits reveal mind structure. Covers Chomsky's problems/mysteries, McGinn's cognitive closure, Nagel's bat, Kant/Wittgenstein on limits as constitutive. AI as asymmetric probe for human blind spots. Connected to Occam's Razor Has Limits, Dualism, and No Many Worlds tenets.
- **Output**: `voids/limits-reveal-structure.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Write article on epistemic advantages of non-materialist theories
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Dualism opens far more possibilities than materialism allows. Examples: (1) whatever "runs" consciousness might one day rebel or reject what we do (e.g., keeping brains alive in jars); (2) the non-physical realm could have its own complex dynamics we're unaware of. Materialists risk stumbling into these problems while denying their existence. Dualism brings the most open mind. Tie to the No Occam's Razor tenet—allowing the mind realm to be arbitrarily complex widens our epistemic possibilities rather than prematurely closing them. Frame as: why epistemically humble positions favour taking dualism seriously, even if unproven.
- **Result**: Created ~2000 word topic article arguing that dualism is the epistemically humble stance. Covers: materialism's closing moves (foreclosing possibilities by assumption), what dualism opens (complex mental reality, risks materialists cannot see, scenarios excluded a priori), and the argument from epistemic humility (asymmetric costs of being wrong). Connected to all five tenets with Occam's Razor Has Limits as central.
- **Output**: `topics/epistemic-advantages-of-dualism.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Cross-review quantum-consciousness.md considering prebiotic collapse insights

- **Notes**: New article concepts/prebiotic-collapse.md commits the site to objective-reduction-with-consciousness-modulation. Review tenets/tenets.md to strengthen No Many Worlds and Minimal Quantum Interaction tenets with explicit prebiotic problem response.
- **Result**: Added new "The prebiotic collapse problem" paragraph to No Many Worlds tenet explaining the objection and site's resolution. Links to prebiotic-collapse concept page and quantum-consciousness section. Clarifies that physical mechanisms provide baseline collapse while consciousness modulates outcomes in neural systems.
- **Output**: Updated `tenets/tenets.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Create concept page on prebiotic collapse / collapse before minds
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/collapse-before-minds-early-universe-2026-01-16.md. Addresses the objection: if consciousness causes collapse, what selected outcomes before observers existed? Five major responses surveyed. Would strengthen No Many Worlds and Minimal Quantum Interaction tenets by addressing this common objection.
- **Result**: Created ~2000 word concept page covering the prebiotic collapse problem, five major responses (Wheeler's participatory universe, panpsychism, objective reduction, decoherence naturalization, Stapp's panexperientialism). Commits site to objective-reduction-with-consciousness-modulation position. Explains how this preserves all tenets while solving the prebiotic problem.
- **Output**: `concepts/prebiotic-collapse.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Add coherence inflation countermeasures to generation workflow
- **Type**: build-tool
- **Notes**: Because the site is intentionally a single worldview expressed as fact and heavily AI-generated, add hard constraints: (1) per-claim confidence metadata, (2) mandatory steelman sections for key opponents, (3) provenance tagging for empirical claims, (4) periodic external red-team reviews, (5) detection of circular citation loops across pages.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive protocol document with seven countermeasures: confidence stratification, mandatory steelman sections, provenance tagging, external red-team reviews, circular citation detection, freshness tracking, and explicit uncertainty propagation. Includes implementation details for workflow integration.
- **Output**: `project/coherence-inflation-countermeasures.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Create Voids safety protocol
- **Type**: meta-method
- **Notes**: If "voids" includes the occluded/unthinkable, the project needs explicit safety rails: avoid memetic hazards, coercive ideology traps, and psychologically destabilizing content; separate exploratory speculation from endorsed claims; require human review gates; define stop conditions.
- **Result**: Created safety protocol with seven principles: clear epistemic labeling, content boundaries (prohibited and boundary cases), exploration/endorsement separation, human review gates, exit paths, stop conditions, and no "hidden truth" framing. Includes reader notice for voids section.
- **Output**: `project/voids-safety-protocol.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Create concept page on QM interpretations
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/qm-interpretations-beyond-mwi-2026-01-16.md. Covers Copenhagen, Bohmian, QBism, relational QM, TI/TSVF, GRW/CSL.

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/phenomenal-value-realism-metaethics-2026-01-16.md. The site implicitly treats conscious experience as the ground of value but doesn't name this metaethical position. Should cover Rawlette's analytic hedonism, phenomenal value pluralism, and comparison with welfarism/desire theory. Would formalize the implicit commitment and strengthen ethics-of-consciousness.md.
- **Result**: Created ~1900 word concept page covering Rawlette's analytic hedonism, the is-ought bridge, site's phenomenal value pluralism (beyond hedonism), connection to dualism and indexical identity, implications for AI/animal ethics/meaning, objections and responses.
- **Output**: `concepts/phenomenal-value-realism.md`

- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/luck-objection-libertarian-free-will-2026-01-17.md covers van Inwagen's rollback argument and Mele's present/remote luck distinction. Review topics/free-will.md to add explicit engagement with the luck objection—this is the main challenge to libertarian free will that the quantum selection framework must address.
- **Result**: Added new "The Luck Objection" and "Why the Site's Framework Escapes Luck" sections. Covers van Inwagen's rollback argument, Mele's present/remote luck distinction, comparison table (lucky vs selected indeterminism), connection to phenomenology of effort and agent causation.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/free-will.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Formalize the "attention as interface" hypothesis into a mechanistic research agenda
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Attention is treated as dissociable from consciousness and as the likely control surface for mind→brain influence. Convert into actionable questions: which neural correlates of attention are candidates for "selection sites"? What is the relationship to global workspace / predictive processing / IIT? What would count as evidence that attention is more than computation here?  Refer to the source of this task obsidian/reviews/outer-review-2026-01-15-site-chatgpt-5-2-pro.md also.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research formalizing the implicit "attention as interface" commitment into explicit hypothesis and research agenda. Identified five candidate selection sites (frontoparietal networks, posterior hot zone, cortical microcolumns, ion channels, microtubules). Analyzed relation to GWT/IIT/predictive processing—reinterpreted as physical correlates that consciousness uses. Generated five testable research questions with predictions. Listed falsification conditions.
- **Output**: `research/attention-as-interface-hypothesis-2026-01-16.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Develop a dedicated topic on "Time, collapse, and agency"
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Free will uses retrocausality/atemporal selection; collapse is linked to the arrow of time. Consolidate: what metaphysics of time is implied (presentism/eternalism/relational), how "selection across time" avoids contradictions, and what phenomenology of temporal experience (durée/specious present) would be predicted by the framework. Refer to the source of this task obsidian/reviews/outer-review-2026-01-15-site-chatgpt-5-2-pro.md also.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive topic consolidating the site's temporal commitments. Addresses presentism vs eternalism (proposes growing-block with consciousness-constituted collapse), explains how atemporal selection reconciles with irreversibility, maps phenomenology predictions (specious present, possibility narrowing, effort, durée), strengthens free-will arguments, and lists falsification conditions.
- **Output**: `topics/time-collapse-and-agency.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Build testability ledger for the framework
- **Type**: meta-method
- **Notes**: Several pages say the framework is falsifiable, but test hooks are diffuse. Create a central ledger: what observations would update against dualism, against quantum interface, against retrocausal repair, against filter theory? Separate (a) decisive disconfirmers, (b) weak evidence, (c) non-evidence. This also guards against unfalsifiability accusations.
- **Result**: Created comprehensive testability ledger covering all five tenets plus filter theory and retrocausality. For each claim: decisive disconfirmers, weak evidence against, weak evidence for, and non-evidence. Summary table with current assessment of each claim's vulnerability.
- **Output**: `project/testability-ledger.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Create Ethics of consciousness as a core topic
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: The site already touches animal consciousness, AI non-consciousness, and identity non-patternism. Consolidate into an ethics topic: moral patienthood, suffering/valence, moral uncertainty policy, simulation ethics under dualism, and why "copying a person" is not "saving them."
- **Result**: Created ~3000 word topic page covering foundation of consciousness-based ethics, moral patienthood (who counts), moral uncertainty (precautionary principle vs weighted consideration), animal ethics, AI ethics, identity ethics (copies, uploads, simulations), and suffering as moral core. Connected to all five tenets.
- **Output**: `topics/ethics-of-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Unify filter/transmission and quantum selection into a single model
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Filter theory explains correlation without production; quantum selection explains causal efficacy. Build a synthesis page: a two-layer architecture (source/field + interface/control), what each metaphor buys, where each is only heuristic.
- **Result**: Created ~2400 word concept page proposing unified two-layer model: Layer 1 (Source/Field) from filter theory, Layer 2 (Interface/Control) from quantum selection. Explains how layers connect, what each explains, empirical discriminators, and objections/responses. The unified model implements all five tenets.
- **Output**: `concepts/mind-matter-interface.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Research QM interpretations beyond MWI
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Anti-MWI is explicit; the site should also clearly position itself vs Bohmian mechanics, QBism, relational QM, objective collapse (GRW/CSL), and transactional/TSVF approaches—especially because retrocausality plays a big role in free will. Clarify: which interpretations leave room for consciousness-as-selector vs selector-as-physical-law vs "collapse is epistemic only."
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering 6 major interpretations (Copenhagen, Bohmian, QBism, relational QM, TI/TSVF, GRW/CSL). Key finding: TI/TSVF align strongly with site's retrocausality framework. Bohmian mechanics conflicts with free will phenomenology. QBism is agent-centered but anti-realist. Provides recommendations for site positioning.
- **Output**: `research/qm-interpretations-beyond-mwi-2026-01-16.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Deep review split-brain-consciousness.md

- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New research in quantum-biology-consciousness-2026-01-16.md provides biological examples of quantum coherence (avian magnetoreception microseconds, enzyme tunneling). Review concepts/decoherence.md to add these biological examples as evidence that decoherence isn't always rapid.
- **Result**: Enhanced quantum biology sections in decoherence.md. Added microsecond coherence times for avian magnetoreception (million times longer than typical molecular decoherence), Jan 2026 Princeton JACS confirmation, specific enzyme tunneling acceleration factors (10^12-10^17), kinetic isotope evidence. Added quantum-biology to related_articles and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/decoherence.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Research the luck objection to libertarian free will
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: The luck objection (van Inwagen, Mele) argues that indeterminism makes actions random rather than free. Kane's response appeals to self-forming actions; agent-causation theorists appeal to substance causation. How does the site's quantum selection framework address this? Is consciousness-directed selection different from mere randomness? Would strengthen free-will.md and agent-causation.md.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering van Inwagen's rollback argument, Mele's present/remote luck distinction, Kane's SFAs and dual efforts response, agent-causal responses (O'Connor, Lowe, Chisholm). Key contribution: how site's quantum selection framework addresses the objection—reasons-guided selection is distinct from mere randomness; phenomenology of effort distinguishes selection from luck.
- **Output**: `research/luck-objection-libertarian-free-will-2026-01-17.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-17: Research consciousness-selecting mechanisms in detail
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: The site's Minimal Quantum Interaction and Bidirectional Interaction tenets depend on consciousness selecting among quantum outcomes. But what would the detailed mechanism look like? Key questions: How does attention/intention map to specific neural quantum systems? What's the information bandwidth? Does selection happen at individual neurons, microtubules, or larger ensembles? Would strengthen quantum-consciousness.md and support the P2 task for consciousness-selecting-neural-patterns concept page.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering candidate selection sites (microtubules/Orch OR, spintronic coherence/QBIT, ion channels, cortical microcolumns, attention networks), 2025 experimental support, bandwidth constraints (~10 bits/second implies coarse-grained policy-level selection), how attention maps to quantum systems via Stapp's Zeno mechanism, ensemble vs single-site selection, brain specialness boundary.
- **Output**: `research/consciousness-selecting-mechanisms-detail-2026-01-17.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Propose alignment objective framed in experiential terms
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: If preferences are thin proxies and AI lacks "inside understanding," alignment should target predicted distributions over human experiences (suffering, agency, meaning, attention, social connection). Draft a concrete schema: what measurable proxies could approximate experiential quality without collapsing into naïve behaviorism? Tie to neurophenomenology/first-person methods and explicitly state failure modes (Goodhart, manipulation, wireheading-like traps).  Refer to the source of this task obsidian/reviews/outer-review-2026-01-15-site-chatgpt-5-2-pro.md also.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research proposing multi-dimensional experiential alignment schema. Identified eight candidate experiential dimensions (hedonic valence, suffering, agency, meaning, attention, connection, understanding, temporal experience). Proposed measurable proxies (ESM, DRM, microphenomenology, neural signatures) with their limitations. Analyzed failure modes (four Goodhart variants, wireheading risks, manipulation risks, homogenization risks). Specified safeguards (proxy pluralism, first-person methods, human override, adversarial testing). Connected to site's phenomenal value pluralism metaethics.
- **Output**: `research/alignment-objective-experiential-terms-2026-01-16.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Create concept page for quantum-biology

- **Notes**: Research completed in research/quantum-biology-consciousness-2026-01-16.md. Covers photosynthesis FMO complex, avian magnetoreception (Jan 2026 Princeton JACS), enzyme tunneling, quantum olfaction. Would provide empirical grounding for Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet and strengthen decoherence objection response.
- **Result**: Created dedicated concept page covering established quantum biological effects (photosynthesis, avian magnetoreception, enzyme tunneling, olfaction), brain quantum theories (Orch OR, QBIT), and implications for the site's framework. Key argument: quantum biology removes the categorical "warm, wet, and noisy" objection without itself proving consciousness involves quantum effects. Defensive role for Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet.
- **Output**: `concepts/quantum-biology.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Create dedicated concept page on haecceity and indexical identity
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: The site leans heavily on indexical identity in anti-MWI and personal identity, but doesn't name the metaphysical commitment. Build a page explaining haecceitism, self-locating facts, and how "this subject" differs from pattern-identity. Connect to pairing problem, personal identity, teleportation/uploading cases, and MWI probability/indexical puzzles.
- **Result**: Created ~2000 word concept page covering Duns Scotus's haecceity concept, haecceitism vs anti-haecceitism debate, why consciousness requires haecceity (zombie argument connection), self-locating beliefs, teleportation/uploading implications, connection to pairing problem and MWI probability problem. Connected to site's dualism, no-many-worlds, and bidirectional interaction tenets.
- **Output**: `concepts/haecceity.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Research phenomenal value realism and metaethics
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Meaning-of-life + alignment pages implicitly treat conscious experience as the ground of value. Make that explicit: what kind of realism is this (or is it constructivist)? How does it relate to welfarism, virtue ethics, contractualism, error theory, etc.? What exactly is the "intrinsic significance" claim (valence, richness, unity, agency, narrative, attention)?
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering Sharon Hewitt Rawlette's phenomenal value realism / analytic hedonism, the is-ought bridge via phenomenal qualities being simultaneously descriptive and normative, comparison with welfarism/desire theory/objective list theory. Identified site's implicit position as "phenomenal value pluralism"—multiple features of experience have intrinsic value (not just hedonic valence). Recommended making the metaethical commitment explicit in a dedicated concept page.
- **Output**: `research/phenomenal-value-realism-metaethics-2026-01-16.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Address "collapse before minds" (early-universe outcome selection)
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: No Many Worlds + real outcome selection creates a prebiotic cosmology pressure: what selected outcomes before observers? Options: objective collapse with consciousness modulation; panpsychist/proto-experiential selection; cosmic consciousness; other. Create a dedicated treatment that cleanly separates "collapse exists" from "consciousness causes collapse," and states which version the site commits to (or why it stays agnostic). Refer to the source of this task obsidian/reviews/outer-review-2026-01-15-site-chatgpt-5-2-pro.md also.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering five major responses to the prebiotic problem: (1) Wheeler's participatory universe (retrocausal bootstrapping), (2) panpsychism/proto-experiential selection, (3) Penrose-style objective reduction (collapse precedes consciousness), (4) decoherence naturalization, (5) separation of "collapse exists" from "consciousness causes collapse." Recommended site position: objective reduction with consciousness modulation—collapse happens via physical mechanisms (preserving prebiotic cosmology) but consciousness interfaces with collapse in developed neural systems.
- **Output**: `research/collapse-before-minds-early-universe-2026-01-16.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Research psychophysical coupling problem ("selection law")
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: The site repeatedly says consciousness "selects" among quantum outcomes (tenets; free will; quantum consciousness). Make explicit that this requires a psychophysical coupling law: what variables in conscious experience map to what selectable degrees of freedom? What is the bandwidth? What is not selectable? Propose candidate constraint families (e.g., selection only within attention-controlled neural subspaces; only policy-level not micro-level; only basis-choice not amplitude). Aim: turn "selection" from metaphor into a research program. Refer to the source of this task obsidian/reviews/outer-review-2026-01-15-site-chatgpt-5-2-pro.md also.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research identifying the coupling problem and proposing four candidate constraint families: (1) Attention-bounded selection (~10 bits/second bandwidth), (2) Policy-level selection (coarse alternatives only), (3) Basis-choice selection (choosing the question, not the answer), (4) Temporal/indexical selection. Integrated 2024-2025 research on conscious processing bandwidth, Chalmers on psychophysical laws, Stapp on quantum selection, and recent quantum consciousness developments.
- **Output**: `research/psychophysical-coupling-problem-2026-01-15.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Research brain specialness boundary (why not psychokinesis)
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Minimal Quantum Interaction + Bidirectional Interaction risks sliding into "mind can bias any quantum event." The site rejects woo, but needs an explicit limiter: why is the interface restricted to brains (or to systems already integrated into the subject's control loop)? Produce a principled boundary condition and show how it avoids both epiphenomenalism and parapsychology-by-implication. Refer to the source of this task obsidian/reviews/outer-review-2026-01-15-site-chatgpt-5-2-pro.md also.
- **Result**: Research establishing four principled boundary conditions: (1) Interface locality—only systems within neural control loop, (2) Control loop integration—selection requires awareness of alternatives, (3) Developmental/evolutionary integration—only systems the brain grew with, (4) Attention scope—only what can be attended. Key insight: the boundary follows mechanistically from Stapp's Process 1 model, not from ad hoc restriction. The quantum Zeno mechanism operates through attention, which is neurally implemented; consciousness can only bias what it observes.
- **Output**: `research/brain-specialness-boundary-2026-01-15.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Research quantum biology and consciousness
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Avian magnetoreception demonstrates evolution can harness quantum coherence for biological function. What other quantum biological effects exist? Photosynthesis quantum coherence, enzyme tunneling, olfaction theories. How do these relate to the possibility of neural quantum effects? Would strengthen the decoherence objection response and provide empirical grounding for Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering established quantum biological effects (photosynthesis FMO complex, avian magnetoreception with Jan 2026 Princeton confirmation, enzyme quantum tunneling, quantum olfaction) and brain quantum effects (Orch OR, QBIT theories). Key findings: biological quantum effects prove evolution can harness coherence; the "warm, wet, and noisy" objection is weaker than claimed; measurement problem remains open in all cases.
- **Output**: `research/quantum-biology-consciousness-2026-01-16.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Cross-review arguments/materialism.md considering decoherence research
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Research in quantum-decoherence-objection-responses-2026-01-15.md includes key finding that decoherence doesn't solve the measurement problem—physics remains incomplete at collapse. Review arguments/materialism.md to strengthen Argument 4 (Physics Is Incomplete) with specific decoherence-collapse analysis.
- **Result**: Strengthened decoherence objection section with Tegmark-Hameroff dispute (7 orders of magnitude difference), avian magnetoreception as biological proof of evolved quantum coherence, and key insight that decoherence doesn't solve the measurement problem—physics remains incomplete at collapse.
- **Output**: Updated `arguments/materialism.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Cross-review tenets.md with decoherence research
- **Type**: cross-review

- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/quantum-decoherence-objection-responses-2026-01-15.md provides comprehensive coverage of decoherence objection responses: Tegmark-Hameroff debate, protective mechanisms (Debye layer, actin gel), biological quantum effects (photosynthesis, avian magnetoreception), and key finding that decoherence doesn't eliminate quantum indeterminacy. Review quantum-consciousness.md to strengthen the decoherence objection section with specific responses and timescale arguments.
- **Result**: Added Tegmark-Hameroff Debate section with 7 orders of magnitude dispute, specific protective mechanisms, revised timescale requirements (10⁻⁷s), avian magnetoreception example with Jan 2026 Princeton JACS paper, and key finding about indeterminacy persisting after decoherence.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/quantum-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Research quantum decoherence objection responses in detail
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: The decoherence objection is mentioned in tenets.md and quantum-consciousness.md but responses could be more specific. What exactly do the "hot cat" experiments show? How does Orch OR address decoherence specifically? What timescales are actually needed for consciousness-related quantum effects? Would strengthen the site's response to this major objection.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering Tegmark-Hameroff debate (7 orders of magnitude difference in estimates), protective mechanisms (Debye layer, actin gel, hydrophobic interior), revised timescales (10⁻⁷s with faster dynamics), biological quantum effects (photosynthesis, avian magnetoreception with Jan 2026 Princeton JACS paper), hot cat experiments (1.8K demonstration), 1,400-second coherence record. Key finding: decoherence doesn't eliminate quantum indeterminacy—consciousness could bias outcomes at measurement even after decoherence.
- **Output**: `research/quantum-decoherence-objection-responses-2026-01-15.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Cross-review ai-consciousness.md considering Hoel LLM consciousness research
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Research in research/hoel-llm-consciousness-continual-learning-2026-01-16.md analyzes Hoel's proximity argument (LLMs are too close to lookup tables) and continual learning criterion. Review topics/ai-consciousness.md to incorporate these insights—particularly the proximity argument against functionalism and how continual learning distinguishes conscious from non-conscious systems.
- **Result**: Added hoel-llm-consciousness research to related_articles; added new "Proximity Argument" subsection with Hoel's formal argument structure, Kleiner-Hoel dilemma, and connection to lookup tables; expanded continual learning section with link to research and lenient dependency explanation; added research to Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/ai-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Cross-review philosophical-zombies.md considering against-functionalism argument
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New argument page arguments/functionalism.md features the zombie argument (Argument 1) as a central anti-functionalist argument. Review concepts/philosophical-zombies.md to add link to the argument page and strengthen the connection between zombies and functionalism's failure.
- **Result**: Added against-functionalism-argument to related_articles; expanded Zombies and Functionalism section with link to formal argument page, formal argument structure (5 premises), and expanded China brain discussion; added argument page to Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/philosophical-zombies.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Cross-review functionalism.md considering against-functionalism argument
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New argument page arguments/functionalism.md presents five formal arguments against functionalism (absent qualia, inverted qualia, Chinese Room, multiple realizability cuts both ways, explanatory gap). Review concepts/functionalism.md to add link to the dedicated argument page and strengthen the critique with references to the formal argument structures.
- **Result**: Added against-functionalism-argument to related_articles; added reference to formal argument page in introduction; added against-functionalism-argument, philosophical-zombies, and inverted-qualia to Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/functionalism.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Research arXiv paper 2512.12802 and evaluate against site tenets
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Research the paper at https://web3.arxiv.org/abs/2512.12802 and evaluate how it stands up to the site's perspective on consciousness and dualism. Assess alignment or tension with the five tenets.
- **Result**: Analyzed Erik Hoel's "A Disproof of Large Language Model Consciousness" which argues continual learning is necessary for consciousness. Found mostly aligned with site tenets: anti-functionalism (proximity argument), consciousness as causal (implicit support for Bidirectional Interaction), skepticism of simple parsimony (supports Occam's Razor Has Limits). Orthogonal treatment of quantum mechanisms.
- **Output**: `research/hoel-llm-consciousness-continual-learning-2026-01-16.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Cross-review mental-causation.md considering against-epiphenomenalism argument
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New argument page arguments/epiphenomenalism.md presents five structured arguments against epiphenomenalism, particularly the self-stultification argument with formal premises. Review concepts/mental-causation.md to add link to the dedicated argument page and reference the formal argument structure in the self-stultification section.
- **Result**: Added epiphenomenalism-argument to related_articles; expanded self-stultification section with formal argument structure; added argument page to Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/mental-causation.md`

- **Result**: Added many-worlds to concepts; expanded No Many Worlds Connection section with link to formal argument page and detailed explanation of indexical problem; added many-worlds to Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/personal-identity.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Create argument page "Against Functionalism"
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: The arguments section needs 5 pages (currently 4: materialism, interactionist-dualism, many-worlds, epiphenomenalism). Functionalism is a major materialist position that the zombie argument and inverted qualia arguments undermine. Should cover: multiple realizability cuts both ways (if mental states are multiply realizable, physical substrate doesn't determine qualia), Chinese Room argument (syntax isn't semantics), absent qualia possibility, inverted qualia possibility. Draw from functionalism.md, philosophical-zombies.md, and inverted-qualia.md.
- **Result**: Created ~2400 word argument page with five arguments (absent qualia, inverted qualia, Chinese Room, multiple realizability cuts both ways, explanatory gap) with objections and responses. Connected to all five tenets.
- **Output**: `arguments/functionalism.md`, updated `arguments/arguments.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Create argument page "Against Epiphenomenalism"
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: The arguments section targets 5 pages but currently has only 2 (Against Materialism, For Interactionist Dualism). Epiphenomenalism is a major alternative to interactionism that the site's Bidirectional Interaction tenet directly rejects. Should cover: self-stultification argument (if consciousness is causally inert, our reports about it are accidentally right at best), evolutionary argument (phenomenal states must do something to have been selected), knowledge argument implications (Mary learns something causally relevant). Draw from epiphenomenalism.md and mental-causation.md.
- **Result**: Created ~2000 word argument page with five arguments (self-stultification, evolutionary objection, knowledge argument reversed, introspection problem, self-knowledge problem). Connected to all five tenets and linked to quantum framework response.
- **Output**: `arguments/epiphenomenalism.md`, updated `arguments/arguments.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Cross-review quantum-consciousness.md considering many-worlds argument
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New argument page arguments/many-worlds.md presents five arguments against MWI including the probability problem and preferred basis problem. Review concepts/quantum-consciousness.md to strengthen the connection—the quantum consciousness page should reference how site's collapse-based framework contrasts with MWI's unitarity assumption.
- **Result**: Added many-worlds to related_articles; expanded No Many Worlds tenet reference with link to five arguments; added many-worlds explanation in shared features section; added many-worlds to Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/quantum-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Cross-review measurement-problem.md considering many-worlds argument
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New argument page arguments/many-worlds.md covers the measurement problem from an anti-MWI perspective. Review concepts/measurement-problem.md to add explicit engagement with MWI as a proposed solution and why the site rejects it—this strengthens the No Many Worlds tenet.
- **Result**: Added many-worlds to related_articles; expanded MWI subsection with link to five detailed arguments; added many-worlds to Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/measurement-problem.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Create argument page "Against Many Worlds"
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: The No Many Worlds tenet needs a dedicated argument page in the arguments section. Should cover: ontological proliferation, indexical identity problems, probability interpretation issues, and why the site prefers collapse interpretations. Would strengthen the arguments section (currently only 1 of 5 target pages).
- **Result**: Created ~2300 word argument page with five arguments (ontological extravagance, indexical identity problem, probability problem, preferred basis problem, consciousness unaddressed) structured with premises and conclusions. Added objections and responses, connected to all five tenets.
- **Output**: `arguments/many-worlds.md`, updated `arguments/arguments.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Cross-review causal-closure.md considering interactionist-dualism argument
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New argument page arguments/interactionist-dualism.md presents the self-stultification argument and quantum indeterminacy mechanism. Review concepts/causal-closure.md to strengthen the connection—the causal closure page should explicitly reference how the interactionist argument page addresses the closure objection.
- **Result**: Added reference to formal argument page in quantum exception section; added interactionist-dualism to related_articles.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/causal-closure.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Cross-review epiphenomenalism.md considering interactionist-dualism argument
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New argument page arguments/interactionist-dualism.md presents the self-stultification argument against epiphenomenalism. Review concepts/epiphenomenalism.md to add reference to the formal argument structure and strengthen the objections section.
- **Result**: Added reference to formal argument page in self-stultification section.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/epiphenomenalism.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Create argument page "For Interactionist Dualism"
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: The arguments section has only 1 page (Against Materialism) vs target of 5. A formal argument page for interactionist dualism would consolidate the positive case: knowledge argument, conceivability arguments, unity of consciousness, intentionality, self-stultification of epiphenomenalism. Draw from arguments-for-dualism.md concept page but in structured argument form.
- **Result**: Created ~2000 word argument page with seven arguments (explanatory gap, zombie conceivability, Mary's Room, unity of consciousness, intentionality, self-stultification, quantum indeterminacy) structured in formal argument form with premises and conclusions. Added objections and responses table, connected to all five tenets.
- **Output**: `arguments/interactionist-dualism.md`, updated `arguments/arguments.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Cross-review hard-problem-of-consciousness.md considering pairing-problem insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/pairing-problem.md presents Kim's challenge that mind-body pairing is unintelligible without spatial relations. Review topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness.md to add pairing problem as another dimension of the hard problem—not just "why experience?" but "why *this* experience with *this* body?"
- **Result**: Added new "The Pairing Problem: Why This Mind with This Body?" section explaining Kim's challenge as a distinct dimension of the hard problem, three major responses (spatial location, haecceity, non-spatial causation), and how the site's quantum framework addresses both pairing and closure problems. Added pairing-problem to concepts list and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Cross-review substance-property-dualism.md considering pairing-problem insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/pairing-problem.md covers Kim's challenge to substance dualism and three major responses. Review concepts/substance-property-dualism.md to engage with the pairing problem—since it challenges substance dualism specifically, this page should address whether property dualism avoids the problem.
- **Result**: Added new "On the pairing-problem" subsection in "Where They Differ" explaining Kim's challenge, how property dualism avoids it trivially, and three substance dualist responses (spatial location, haecceity, non-spatial causation). Added pairing-problem and quantum-consciousness to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/substance-property-dualism.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Cross-review measurement-problem.md considering consciousness research
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/consciousness-measurement-problem-2026-01-16.md covers the problem of definite outcomes, von Neumann-Wigner, Stapp's quantum Zeno, and the causal closure loophole. Review concepts/measurement-problem.md to strengthen the connection between the measurement problem and consciousness—particularly how quantum indeterminacy creates conceptual space for mental causation.
- **Result**: Added detailed Stapp's Quantum Zeno Framework subsection explaining how mental effort protracts neural assemblies via repeated observation. Added new "The Causal Closure Loophole" section explaining how measurement indeterminacy creates space for mental causation without energy violation. Added mental-causation and mental-effort to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/measurement-problem.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Research quantum mechanics and free will
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: The site connects quantum indeterminacy with libertarian free will but could engage more deeply with this philosophical literature. Key topics: Does quantum randomness help free will or hurt it? How do libertarians respond to the "luck objection"? What role does agent causation play in quantum approaches? Robert Kane, Peter van Inwagen, and recent work on quantum approaches to free will.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering the luck objection, event-causal vs agent-causal libertarianism, Kane's 2024 evolution toward substance causation, van Inwagen's consequence and mind arguments, Mele's soft libertarianism, Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism, and O'Connor/Lowe on substance causation. Key finding: the debate confirms quantum indeterminacy provides conceptual space for mental causation but requires an account of how consciousness directs rather than randomizes outcomes—exactly what the site's framework provides.
- **Output**: `research/quantum-mechanics-free-will-2026-01-16.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Create concept page on the pairing problem
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Kim's pairing problem (Kim 2005) is a distinct challenge to substance dualism—what pairs a particular mind with a particular body if minds lack spatial location? Research in objections-to-interactionist-dualism covers this but deserves dedicated treatment given its significance. Should include Bailey/Rasmussen/Van Horn haecceity response and spatial location response.
- **Result**: Created ~2000 word concept page covering the problem statement, Kim's principle (causation requires spatial relations), three major responses (spatial location of minds, haecceity response, non-spatial causation), and how the site's quantum framework addresses the problem by locating consciousness where it causally interfaces with the brain.
- **Output**: `concepts/pairing-problem.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-16: Research consciousness and the measurement problem
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: The site's Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet depends on consciousness playing a role at quantum collapse. What does contemporary philosophy of physics say about the measurement problem and its solutions? Key questions: What interpretations preserve a role for consciousness? How do objective collapse theories (GRW, Penrose OR) differ from consciousness-based collapse? What does the "problem of definite outcomes" reveal about physical completeness?
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering the measurement problem (problem of definite outcomes), five major positions (consciousness-causes-collapse, Stapp's quantum Zeno, GRW/CSL objective collapse, Penrose-Diosi gravitational collapse, many-worlds), and how quantum indeterminacy creates a loophole in causal closure. Key finding: decoherence explains basis selection but not single-outcome selection—leaving conceptual space for mental causation at indeterminacies.
- **Output**: `research/consciousness-measurement-problem-2026-01-16.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Cross-review tenets.md considering cognitive-science-dualism research
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/cognitive-science-dualism-2026-01-15.md covers Bloom's "natural-born dualists," developmental evidence, and Barrett et al.'s cross-cultural study (finding "intuitive materialism" as default). Review tenets.md, particularly the Occam's Razor Has Limits section, to address whether dualism is cognitively natural or learned. Key finding: evidence is mixed—cognitive naturalness doesn't determine metaphysical truth, but this nuance is worth noting.
- **Result**: Added "folk error" subsection to Occam's Razor Has Limits tenet. Covers Bloom vs Barrett et al. debate on whether dualism is innate or learned; emphasizes that cognitive naturalness doesn't determine metaphysical truth.
- **Output**: Updated `tenets/tenets.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Cross-review interactionist-dualism.md considering objections research
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/objections-to-interactionist-dualism-2026-01-15.md covers Kim's pairing problem and conservation laws. Review concepts/interactionist-dualism.md to add dedicated treatment of these objections—especially the pairing problem which is distinct from causal closure and requires a spatial location response.
- **Result**: Added new Pairing Problem section after Causal Closure. Covers Kim's distinct challenge (what pairs mind with body without spatial relations), spatial location response (Hasker, Zimmerman), and haecceity response (Bailey, Rasmussen, Van Horn). Added Kim 2005 and Bailey et al. 2011 to references.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/interactionist-dualism.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Research cognitive science of dualism
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: The phenomenology-first-person-methods research noted that "intuitive dualism" is empirically widespread—most people naturally think in dualist terms. What does cognitive science say about folk dualism? Bloom's "Descartes' Baby," developmental studies, cross-cultural evidence. Would strengthen Occam's Razor Has Limits argument—if dualism is cognitively natural, dismissing it as "unscientific" may miss something.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering Bloom's natural-born dualists thesis, developmental evidence from children, Barrett et al.'s cross-cultural study finding "intuitive materialism" as default, Bering's cognitive default hypothesis, and Barlev & Shtulman's learned dualism view. Key finding: evidence is mixed—neither innate dualism nor materialism is clearly default; cognitive naturalness doesn't determine metaphysical truth.
- **Output**: `research/cognitive-science-dualism-2026-01-15.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Cross-review arguments-for-dualism.md considering objections research
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/objections-to-interactionist-dualism-2026-01-15.md covers 5 major objections: Kim's pairing problem, conservation laws (Papineau), parsimony, evolutionary argument, and exclusion. Review concepts/arguments-for-dualism.md to engage with these objections—a strong positive case for dualism should acknowledge and respond to the best counterarguments.
- **Result**: Added new "Major Objections and Responses" section covering pairing problem (spatial location response), conservation laws (quantum selection), exclusion argument (physics insufficient), and evolutionary argument (supports interactionism). Added causal-closure and mental-causation to concepts and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/arguments-for-dualism.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Cross-review materialism.md considering analytic-idealism insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/analytic-idealism.md presents Kastrup's view that consciousness is fundamental and matter is appearance. Review concepts/materialism.md to add idealism as a competing alternative—the materialism page should engage with this challenge to the physicalist worldview.
- **Result**: Added new "Idealism as an Alternative" subsection in The Materialist Response, explaining how analytic idealism challenges materialism from a different angle than dualism. Added analytic-idealism to concepts list and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/materialism.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Cross-review epiphenomenalism.md considering mental-causation insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/mental-causation.md covers arguments against epiphenomenalism (self-stultification, quantum opening). Review concepts/epiphenomenalism.md to strengthen the objections section and link to the dedicated mental-causation treatment.
- **Result**: Added mental-causation, causal-closure, interactionist-dualism to concepts; expanded closure argument with Kim's exclusion structure and quantum response; linked self-stultification section to mental-causation article; expanded Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/epiphenomenalism.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Research objections to interactionist dualism
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: The site has strong positive arguments for dualism but could engage more deeply with the strongest objections. Research the strongest contemporary objections beyond causal closure: conservation laws (Papineau), pairing problem (Kim), evolutionary arguments, parsimony arguments. Would strengthen interactionist-dualism.md and arguments-for-dualism.md by engaging opponents directly.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering 5 major objections: Kim's pairing problem (spatial location), conservation laws (Papineau), parsimony/simplicity, evolutionary argument (actually supports interactionism), and exclusion argument. Includes responses and assessment for each.
- **Output**: `research/objections-to-interactionist-dualism-2026-01-15.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Cross-review interactionist-dualism.md considering mental-causation insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/mental-causation.md covers the exclusion argument, overdetermination, and how the quantum framework addresses these challenges. Review concepts/interactionist-dualism.md to engage more explicitly with Kim's exclusion argument—this is the main philosophical challenge to interactionism.
- **Result**: Expanded causal closure section with Kim's 4-premise structure; added explicit links to causal-closure.md and mental-causation.md; added self-stultification argument as positive motivation for interactionism.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/interactionist-dualism.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Cross-review death-and-consciousness.md considering filter-theory insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: The filter-theory article discusses consciousness persistence and the "what consciousness would look like if brain filters rather than produces" question.

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Research the self and consciousness
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: What is the relationship between consciousness and the sense of self? Distinct from personal identity (which focuses on persistence), this concerns the phenomenology and metaphysics of selfhood in conscious experience. Key areas: minimal self vs narrative self (Gallagher, Zahavi), self-model theory (Metzinger), no-self traditions (Buddhism), and implications for dualism. Connects to self-reference-paradox, Eastern philosophy, and hard problem articles.
- **Source**: gap_analysis
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering Gallagher/Zahavi minimal self vs narrative self distinction, Metzinger's self-model theory of subjectivity (PSM, transparency, naïve realism), Buddhist anattā doctrine and five aggregates, contemporary philosophy of mind connections. Key finding: minimal self is pre-reflective first-person givenness; narrative self is constructed through life stories; filter theory can interpret PSM as interface rather than generator of selfhood.

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Research what loss of consciousness reveals about mind and brain
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: What does the loss of consciousness tell us about the mind and brain? Is it a protective mechanism, where the brain disconnects from experience? Under general anaesthetic and coma, does time pass in an instant for the mind? How do drugs cause loss of consciousness? Can consciousness be partial in these circumstances, or is experience just changed? Research the subject deeply.
- **Source**: human
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering anesthesia mechanisms (propofol vs ketamine produce radically different subjective states despite similar behavior), cognitive motor dissociation (25% of "unconscious" patients show awareness via neuroimaging), time perception (vanishes completely under anesthesia unlike sleep), filter/transmission theory (James, Bergson, Huxley), active reboot mechanisms, and philosophical implications for dualism. Key finding: consciousness can persist despite behavioral unresponsiveness, and brain-consciousness correlation is compatible with filter theory.

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Research mind-brain separation and division of faculties
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: What can we perceive about the separation between mind and brain? What parts are intrinsic to the mind, like qualia? What parts the brain, like triggers for respiration? What aspects function whilst unconscious? Study vision as a particular case. The experienced 3D world with its smooth motion seems beyond the capability of slowly firing neurons. Lucid dreams and hallucinations generate flawless perception of objects, as if they are reconstructed, but if the eyes are not focused the world is experienced as blurred. Research all of these aspects deeply. Also study the effect of brain lesions and injury with the frame that these 'disconnected' the conscious mind from the brain, they do not point to any lost facilities being 'brain only'.
- **Source**: human
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Comprehensive research on dividing mental faculties between mind and brain. Key findings: qualia appear intrinsic to mind; automatic functions (respiration) clearly neural; vision presents puzzle—3D world seems to exceed slow-firing neurons but blur persists in dreams. Evidence: binding problem unsolved ("no plausible neural story"), hemispherectomy preserves consciousness, filter/transmission theory (James, Bergson, Huxley) provides coherent alternative. Blindsight shows V1 as "gate" of visual awareness. Proposed "rendering engine" analogy: brain provides computational substrate, mind provides experiential quality.

### ✓ 2026-01-14: Research arguments for dualism (positive case)
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Site extensively argues against materialism but could strengthen the positive case for dualism. Beyond the hard problem, what arguments support dualism? Key areas: conceivability arguments (Chalmers), modal arguments, parsimony reconsidered (is dualism actually simpler?), from-qualia arguments, from-intentionality arguments, from-unity arguments. Survey contemporary dualist defenses (Chalmers, Lowe, Hasker, Swinburne). Would strengthen tenets framework.
- **Source**: gap_analysis
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering seven major positive arguments for dualism: conceivability (zombies), knowledge (Mary's Room), qualia, unity of consciousness, intentionality, modal argument (Swinburne), and personal identity. Key contemporary defenders: Chalmers, Swinburne, Hasker, Lowe, Rickabaugh & Moreland (2023). 22% of philosophers accept dualism (2020 survey). Addresses parsimony objection by showing how explanatory adequacy trumps simplicity.

### ✓ 2026-01-14: Research the inverted qualia problem
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: The inverted spectrum thought experiment (what if your red looks like my green?) is referenced in qualia.md and functionalism.md but lacks dedicated treatment. Important for site's anti-functionalist position—if functional isomorphs can have different qualia, functionalism fails. Key topics: Locke's original formulation, Block's functional isomorphism argument, detectability question, relation to knowledge argument and zombies.
- **Source**: gap_analysis
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering Locke's original formulation, Block and Fodor's 1972 argument, Hardin's color space asymmetries objection, Palmer's limited inversions response, Block's Inverted Earth, representationalism debate, and connections to zombies and knowledge argument.

### ✓ 2026-01-14: Explore consciousness, collapse, and the arrow of time
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Explore whether 'consciousness causes collapse' is relevant to the arrow of time. In a time-reversed scenario, would we see an un-collapse, and is that disallowed or non-physical? This connects to the retrocausality article and the Bidirectional Interaction tenet. Key questions: (1) Does wavefunction collapse define time's arrow independently of entropy? (2) If consciousness selects outcomes at collapse, does this inherently distinguish past from future? (3) What would "un-collapse" even mean—superposition restoration? (4) Does the time-symmetry of quantum equations conflict with irreversible collapse? (5) How does this relate to the site's rejection of Many Worlds (where collapse doesn't occur)?
- **Source**: manual
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering relationship between collapse and time asymmetry, time-symmetric interpretations (TSVF, transactional), Penrose OR theory and gravity-time connection, the un-collapse question, and alignment with all five tenets. Key finding: collapse does break time-reversal symmetry, and if consciousness participates in collapse, consciousness is implicated in temporal directionality itself. Strong connection to retrocausality article—time-symmetric interpretations suggest consciousness's selection may be atemporal.
