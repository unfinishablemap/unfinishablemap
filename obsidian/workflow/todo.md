title: AI Task Queue
topics: []
---

This is the task queue for AI automation. The human reviews and prioritizes tasks; the AI executes them.

## How to Edit This List

- **Promote**: Change `P2` to `P1`, etc.
- **Demote**: Change `P1` to `P2`, etc.
- **Veto**: Add `#veto` anywhere in the task heading (e.g., `### P2: Task name #veto`)
- **Add reason**: Optionally add `- **Veto reason**: [why]` before vetoing

Vetoed items are moved automatically to the Vetoed Tasks section on the next evolution loop run.

## Priority Levels

- **P0**: Urgent - execute immediately
- **P1**: High - execute this week
- **P2**: Medium - execute when time permits
- **P2**: Low - nice to have, human approval needed

## Active Tasks

### P2: Integrate consciousness-threshold-in-cognitive-evolution.md into site navigation
- **Type**: integrate-orphan
- **Notes**: Topics article (created 2026-02-23) has no inbound links. Examines where consciousness emerges in cognitive evolution — directly relevant to animal-consciousness.md, consciousness-as-amplifier.md, and consciousness-evolution-problem.md. Add cross-references from these related articles.
- **Source**: orphan_integration
- **Generated**: 2026-02-25

### P2: Cross-review free-will.md considering counterfactual void insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article voids/counterfactual-void.md (2026-02-25) reveals that modal cognition — imagining what could have been otherwise — is architecturally constrained. free-will.md extensively uses counterfactual reasoning ("could have done otherwise"). The counterfactual void's finding that this modal faculty has invisible boundaries directly impacts libertarian free will arguments. Add cross-reference and address this constraint.
- **Source**: chain (from counterfactual-void.md)
- **Generated**: 2026-02-25

### P3: Deep review epistemological-limits-occams-razor.md
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: AI-generated content (ai_contribution: 100) in voids/ created 2026-02-22, never reviewed. Examines the epistemological limits of Occam's Razor — directly supports Tenet 5 (Occam's Razor Has Limits), the Map's least-covered foundational commitment. Quality assurance is especially important for tenet-supporting content. Verify coherence, cross-references, and tenet alignment.
- **Source**: staleness
- **Generated**: 2026-02-25

### P3: Deep review valence-void.md
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: AI-generated content (ai_contribution: 100) created 2026-02-18, never reviewed. The valence void examines why positive and negative feel the way they do — among the oldest unreviewed void articles not already in the review queue. Verify coherence, cross-references, and tenet alignment.
- **Source**: staleness
- **Generated**: 2026-02-24

### P3: Deep review framework-void.md
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: AI-generated content (ai_contribution: 100) created 2026-02-20, never reviewed. The framework void examines whether consciousness can be captured in any theoretical framework. Verify coherence, cross-references, and tenet alignment.
- **Source**: staleness
- **Generated**: 2026-02-24

### P3: Deep review phenomenology-of-self-reference.md
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: AI-generated content (ai_contribution: 100) created 2026-02-09, never reviewed. Oldest unreviewed voids article not already in the deep-review queue — 15 days without quality assurance. Verify coherence, cross-references, and tenet alignment.
- **Source**: staleness
- **Generated**: 2026-02-24

### P3: Deep review nomic-void.md
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: AI-generated content (ai_contribution: 100) created 2026-02-06, never reviewed. Oldest unreviewed void — 18 days without quality assurance. The nomic void examines whether consciousness could be governed by natural laws at all. Verify coherence, cross-references, and tenet alignment.
- **Source**: staleness
- **Generated**: 2026-02-24

### P3: Deep review evidential-weight-of-voids.md
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: AI-generated content (ai_contribution: 100) created 2026-02-24, never reviewed. Meta-voids article examining what the existence of cognitive voids tells us about the nature and limits of consciousness. As a framework-level piece, quality is especially important. Verify that the evidential arguments are sound and well-connected to specific void articles.
- **Source**: staleness
- **Generated**: 2026-02-24

### P3: Write article on comparative phenomenology of meditative traditions
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The Map cites contemplative evidence across many articles but lacks a systematic comparison of what different traditions report and where they converge. Shamatha, vipassana, zazen, centering prayer, and jhana each reveal different aspects of consciousness's structure. Cross-traditional convergence would provide independent evidence for the Map's phenomenological claims. Builds on contemplative-methods-as-philosophical-methodology.md, the-observer-witness-in-meditation.md, meditation-and-consciousness-modes.md. See optimistic-2026-02-23-night.md

### P3: Write article on the phenomenology of creative problem-solving
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The incubation effect (solutions arriving during non-attention) provides evidence for both delegatory processing and consciousness-as-selector. The "aha" moment's phenomenal structure—sudden gestalt shift from confusion to clarity—may reveal consciousness recognising solutions unconscious processing generated, instantiating the bidirectional architecture. Builds on phenomenology-of-flow-states.md, consciousness-and-aesthetic-creation.md, incubation-effect-and-unconscious-processing.md. See optimistic-2026-02-23-night.md
- **Generated**: 2026-02-22

### P2: apex-evolve: process-and-consciousness — source phenomenal-unity created
- **Type**: other
- **Notes**: Source article concepts/phenomenal-unity created 2026-02-24. Apex article "Process and Consciousness" lists phenomenal-unity as a source and should be updated to integrate this content.
- **Source**: chain (from phenomenal-unity)
- **Generated**: 2026-02-24

### P3: Deep review zombie-master-argument.md
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: AI-generated content (ai_contribution: 100) that has never been reviewed. The zombie master argument is a key piece supporting Tenet 1 (Dualism) and Tenet 3 (Bidirectional Interaction) and warrants quality assurance.
- **Source**: staleness
- **Generated**: 2026-02-23

### P3: Deep review cross-cultural-convergence-on-mental-causation.md
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: AI-generated content (ai_contribution: 100) never reviewed. Examines cross-cultural philosophical traditions on mental causation — a topic that intersects with the Map's treatment of bidirectional interaction and dualism across traditions.
- **Source**: staleness
- **Generated**: 2026-02-24

### P3: Deep review somatic-interface.md
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: AI-generated content (ai_contribution: 100) never reviewed. The somatic interface concept addresses how consciousness interacts with the body — directly relevant to Tenet 3 (Bidirectional Interaction) and the Map's mind-matter interface framework.
- **Source**: staleness
- **Generated**: 2026-02-24

### P3: Write article on the phenomenology of scientific discovery
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. How scientific breakthroughs feel from the inside—the gestalt shift from confusion to understanding, the phenomenal structure of hypothesis formation, the role of aesthetic judgement in theory selection. Scientists report that good theories "feel right" before they can articulate why. Supports consciousness as active participant in cognition. Builds on phenomenology-of-intellectual-effort.md, consciousness-and-scientific-methodology.md, phenomenology-of-epistemic-achievement.md. See optimistic-2026-02-24.md
- **Generated**: 2026-02-24

### P3: Write article on consciousness and the structure of attention disorders
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. ADHD, attentional neglect, and other attention disorders as natural experiments on the consciousness-brain interface. If attention is the selection channel, disorders that alter attentional bandwidth or control should produce predictable changes in conscious experience and agency. Builds on attention-disorders-and-quantum-interface.md, structure-of-attention.md, voluntary-attention-control-mechanisms.md. See optimistic-2026-02-24.md
- **Generated**: 2026-02-24

### P3: Deep review phenomenology-of-consciousness-doing-work.md
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: Apex article (ai_contribution: 100) never reviewed since creation. As a synthesis piece on consciousness's causal efficacy through phenomenological signatures, quality is especially important. Verify coherence, cross-references, and tenet alignment. Directly supports Tenet 3 (Bidirectional Interaction).
- **Source**: staleness
- **Generated**: 2026-02-24

### P3: Deep review samkhya-three-way-distinction.md
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: AI-generated content (ai_contribution: 100) never reviewed. Concept article on Samkhya's consciousness/mind/gross-matter trichotomy — an independent philosophical tradition that enriches the Map's dualism with non-Western conceptual resources. Verify claims about Samkhya philosophy, check tenet alignment, and ensure accurate representation of the tradition. Supports Tenet 1 (Dualism).
- **Source**: staleness
- **Generated**: 2026-02-24

### P3: Write article on the ethics of cognitive enhancement under dualism
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. If moral responsibility scales with attentional capacity (per responsibility-gradient), what follows when capacity can be pharmacologically altered? Does enhancement expand moral duty? Builds on responsibility-gradient-from-attentional-capacity.md, moral-implications-of-genuine-agency.md, attention-disorders-and-quantum-interface.md. See optimistic-2026-02-24-morning.md
- **Generated**: 2026-02-24

### P3: Write voids article on the void of self-knowledge in emotion
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Emotions present paradoxical opacity—we feel them intensely yet often cannot identify what we feel until after the fact. Alexithymia as partial void exploration. Builds on absorption-void.md, emotional-consciousness.md, introspective-opacity.md. See optimistic-2026-02-24-morning.md
- **Generated**: 2026-02-24

### P3: Write concept page for metarepresentation
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. 22+ broken wikilinks across the site reference `[[metarepresentation]]` but no concept page exists. Central to the Jourdain hypothesis and baseline cognition clusters — the Map's strongest empirical argument for bidirectional interaction. Builds on jourdain-hypothesis.md, baseline-cognition.md, consciousness-as-amplifier.md. See optimistic-2026-02-24-afternoon.md
- **Generated**: 2026-02-24

### P3: Write concept page for voluntary-attention
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. 43+ broken wikilinks reference `[[voluntary-attention]]` — the most-referenced missing article on the site. Central to the quantum interface discussion and the attention-as-causal-bridge framework. Builds on attention-as-interface.md, attention-as-causal-bridge.md (apex). See optimistic-2026-02-24-afternoon.md
- **Generated**: 2026-02-24

### P3: Write article on psychedelics and the filter model
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Decreased DMN activity coinciding with expanded conscious experience provides pharmacological evidence for filter/transmission theory over production theory. Current empirical and philosophical interest makes this a notable gap. Builds on dream-consciousness.md, default-mode-network.md, anaesthesia-and-the-consciousness-interface.md. See optimistic-2026-02-24-afternoon.md
- **Generated**: 2026-02-24

### P3: Write article on the phenomenology of mathematical insight
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Mathematical understanding—especially "aha" moments in proof—provides the clearest cases of cognitive phenomenology doing work. Poincaré, Hadamard, and Ramanujan's accounts offer rich phenomenological data. A domain where introspection can be externally validated through performance. Builds on phenomenology-of-understanding.md, consciousness-and-mathematical-cognition.md, argument-from-reason.md. See optimistic-2026-02-24-night.md
- **Generated**: 2026-02-24

### P3: Write article on Islamic and Sufi philosophical traditions on consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The hard-problem-in-non-western-philosophy article covers only Ibn Sīnā from the Islamic tradition. Al-Ghazālī, Sufi phenomenology (Ibn Arabi on imagination as intermediate ontological realm), and the nafs/ruh/aql distinction provide rich dualist resources. The Sufi inner witness parallels contemplative traditions already on the site. Builds on the-hard-problem-in-non-western-philosophy.md, interaction-problem-in-non-western-philosophy.md. See optimistic-2026-02-24-night.md
- **Generated**: 2026-02-24

### P3: Write article on illusionism as epiphenomenalism in disguise
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. If quasi-phenomenal properties do no causal work, illusionism inherits epiphenomenalism's core difficulty under a different label. Does denying phenomenal consciousness solve the problem or change the subject? Would close a gap in the argumentative architecture between the-epiphenomenalist-threat.md and illusionism.md. See optimistic-2026-02-24-night.md
- **Generated**: 2026-02-24

### P3: Write article on the phenomenology of humour and laughter
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Why things are funny is a domain where computational accounts conspicuously fail. Incongruity resolution theories capture joke structure but not the felt quality of amusement — involuntariness, bodily eruption, meaning-bypass. The gestalt-shift of "getting" a joke shares structure with mathematical insight but has distinctive affective valence. The zombie comedian thought experiment provides a new test case for consciousness-causation. Builds on phenomenology-of-understanding.md, consciousness-and-aesthetic-creation.md, phenomenology-of-flow-states.md. See optimistic-2026-02-25-afternoon.md
- **Generated**: 2026-02-25

### P3: Write article on neurological dissociations as interface architecture
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The Map discusses individual neurological conditions across multiple articles but lacks a systematic treatment. Blindsight, hemineglect, anosognosia, alien hand syndrome, and prosopagnosia each disconnect a specific interface component. Taken together, the dissociation pattern maps the interface's functional anatomy — ascending, descending, and bilateral components. Builds on interface-friction.md, pain-asymbolia.md, attention-disorders-and-quantum-interface.md, split-brain.md. See optimistic-2026-02-25-afternoon.md
- **Generated**: 2026-02-25

### P3: Write article on the epistemology of introspective calibration
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The Map relies on introspective evidence but has not addressed whether introspection can be systematically calibrated. Engage Schwitzgebel's scepticism (disagreement, overconfidence, systematic biases) against evidence from contemplative traditions (jhana discrimination, interoceptive accuracy in heartbeat detection tasks). Would strengthen epistemological foundations of every phenomenological claim. Builds on introspection-rehabilitation.md, contemplative-methods-as-philosophical-methodology.md, phenomenal-conservatism-and-introspective-evidence.md. See optimistic-2026-02-25-afternoon.md
- **Generated**: 2026-02-25

### P3: Write article on the trilemma of selection
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The attention-as-selection-interface article contains the determinism/randomness/mental-causation trilemma—possibly the Map's most logically compelling argument—buried within a broader article. A standalone treatment could develop each horn with full rigour, engage compatibilist responses, and connect to the broader argumentative architecture. Builds on attention-as-selection-interface.md, free-will.md, consciousness-and-causal-powers.md. See optimistic-2026-02-25.md
- **Generated**: 2026-02-25

### P3: Write article on emergence as universal hard problem
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The emergence void identifies that the hard problem generalizes to all level transitions, but this insight is confined to the voids section. A topics article could develop the philosophical implications: if emergence is universally opaque, physicalism's promise of bottom-up explanation faces a structural challenge. Connection to the voids-as-meaning thesis would show emergence's opacity as constitutive. Builds on emergence-void.md, hard-problem-of-consciousness.md, void-as-ground-of-meaning.md. See optimistic-2026-02-25.md
- **Generated**: 2026-02-25

### P3: Write article on the evolution of consciousness from a dualist perspective
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The Map has several articles on consciousness-evolution (amplification hypothesis, baseline cognition, animal consciousness) but no unified evolutionary narrative from a dualist perspective. Would integrate the amplification hypothesis, interface development story, and comparative evidence (great ape-human gap) into a coherent account. Builds on consciousness-evolution-problem.md, consciousness-and-intelligence.md, consciousness-as-amplifier.md, animal-consciousness.md. See optimistic-2026-02-25.md
- **Generated**: 2026-02-25

### P2: Write voids article on the reality-feeling void
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/voids-reality-feeling-void-2026-02-14.md. The reality-feeling void examines why experience carries a sense of reality — what makes the real feel real — and why this quality resists analysis. Directly relevant to Tenet 1 (Dualism) and the hard problem: the feeling of reality is a phenomenal quality that seems irreducible to functional description. Connects to hard-problem-of-consciousness.md, whether-real.md, phenomenal-consciousness.md. Target section: voids/.

### ✓ 2026-02-07: Address confidence-uncertainty mismatch in foundational articles
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-05) found pattern across simulation.md, knowledge-argument.md, and ethics-of-consciousness.md: strong claims in main text, uncertainty acknowledgments buried in caveats or "What Would Challenge" sections. Creates misleading impression. Need to integrate conditional language into main claims: "If the simulation hypothesis is coherent, it would suggest..." rather than "The simulation hypothesis dissolves..." Also: knowledge-argument treats intuition as near-probative without engaging methodological debates; ethics article's AI consciousness conclusions rest heavily on contested framework. See pessimistic-2026-02-05.md

- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/simulation.md, obsidian/concepts/knowledge-argument.md, obsidian/topics/ethics-of-consciousness.md

### ✓ 2026-02-09: Write article on phenomenal conservatism and introspective evidence
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-02 (afternoon). Huemer's phenomenal conservatism—if it seems to S that P, S has prima facie justification for believing P—is foundational for treating phenomenal evidence seriously. How does the Map handle introspective reliability? When should phenomenal seemings be trusted? Builds on arguments-for-dualism.md, epistemic-advantages-of-dualism.md, introspection.md. See optimistic-2026-02-02-afternoon.md
- **Source**: optimistic-review
- **Generated**: 2026-02-02
- **Output**: obsidian/topics/phenomenal-conservatism-and-introspective-evidence.md

### ✓ 2026-02-09: Create concept page for phenomenal transparency
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: complete (duplicate of earlier task)

## Completed Tasks


### ✓ 2026-02-25: Integrate perception-and-conscious-experience.md into site navigation
- **Type**: integrate-orphan
- **Notes**: Topics article (created 2026-02-23) has no inbound links. Perception is a central topic for consciousness studies and should be cross-referenced from related articles on phenomenology, qualia, and sensory experience.
- **Output**: obsidian/topics/perception-and-conscious-experience.md -- Context: This file has no inbound links and is orphaned. Focus on finding related articles that should link to this content. Add cross-references from existing articles to integrate this into the site navigation.

### ✓ 2026-02-25: Integrate phenomenology-of-consciousness-doing-work.md into site navigation
- **Type**: integrate-orphan
- **Notes**: Apex article (created 2026-02-23) has no inbound links. As a synthesis piece on consciousness's causal efficacy through phenomenological signatures, it should be well-connected. Add cross-references from related articles (phenomenology-of-effort.md, consciousness-and-causal-powers.md, bidirectional-interaction articles) or update apex index.
- **Output**: obsidian/apex/phenomenology-of-consciousness-doing-work.md -- Context: This file has no inbound links and is orphaned. Focus on finding related articles that should link to this content. Add cross-references from existing articles to integrate this into the site navigation.

### ✓ 2026-02-25: Write voids article on the narrative void
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/voids-narrative-void-2026-02-25.md. The narrative void examines why consciousness constructs narrative structure from experience and whether this structuring distorts or reveals what it captures. Connects to introspective-opacity.md, past-self-void.md, and the Map's phenomenological methodology. Target section: voids/.
- **Output**: Write voids article on the narrative void

### ✓ 2026-02-25: Address gaps in voids/questioning-as-evidence.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review found high-severity issue: the article's central argument (questioning capacity is evidential) is asserted but never argued. Also: observer selection effects dismissed too quickly, self-undermining phenomenology section, weak No Many Worlds connection, and a style guide violation. See pessimistic-2026-02-25-questioning-as-evidence.md
- **Output**: obsidian/voids/questioning-as-evidence.md

Task context:
Pessimistic review found high-severity issue: the article's central argument (questioning capacity is evidential) is asserted but never argued. Also: observer selection effects dismissed too quickly, self-undermining phenomenology section, weak No Many Worlds connection, and a style guide violation. See pessimistic-2026-02-25-questioning-as-evidence.md

### ✓ 2026-02-25: Cross-review causal-interface.md considering agency verification void insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article voids/agency-verification-void.md (2026-02-25) shows consciousness cannot verify its own causal efficacy — the verification problem. causal-interface.md covers how consciousness accesses causal channels — the access problem. These are complementary: one asks how the interface works, the other asks whether we can confirm it works at all. Add cross-references and distinguish access from verification. Supports Tenet 3 (Bidirectional Interaction).
- **Output**: obsidian/voids/causal-interface.md -- Context: Cross-review causal-interface.md considering agency verification void insights

### ✓ 2026-02-25: Write voids article on the agency verification void
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/voids-agency-verification-void-2026-02-15.md. The agency verification void examines the impossibility of verifying one's own causal agency from within — directly relevant to Tenet 3 (Bidirectional Interaction). If consciousness causally influences the physical through quantum selection, can we verify this from the inside? Connects to free-will.md, agent-causation.md, self-reference-paradox.md. Target section: voids/.
- **Output**: Write voids article on the agency verification void

### ✓ 2026-02-25: Cross-review defended-territory.md considering simulation-detection-void insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article voids/simulation-detection-void.md (2026-02-25) directly invokes the defended territory framework — if we are simulated, thoughts approaching simulation detection might be actively deflected. defended-territory.md should cross-reference this as a paradigmatic case where the territory actively resists cognitive approach. Add cross-links and check for argument reinforcement.
- **Output**: obsidian/voids/defended-territory.md -- Context: Cross-review defended-territory.md considering simulation-detection-void insights

### ✓ 2026-02-25: Cross-review incompleteness-void.md considering cartography-problem insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article voids/cartography-problem.md (2026-02-25) explicitly compares itself to the incompleteness void — the cartography problem operates at the meta-level (voids in the voids framework) while the incompleteness void applies Gödel to mathematical cognition. Cross-review to sharpen this distinction, add cross-links, and ensure consistent treatment of formal incompleteness across levels.
- **Output**: obsidian/voids/incompleteness-void.md -- Context: Cross-review incompleteness-void.md considering cartography-problem insights

### ✓ 2026-02-25: Cross-review whether-real.md considering cartography-problem insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article voids/cartography-problem.md (2026-02-25) examines whether mapping consciousness necessarily distorts what it maps — a meta-void about the project of void-exploration itself. whether-real.md examines the ontological status of voids. The cartography problem raises the question of whether void cataloging introduces artifacts, directly relevant to whether voids are "real" features or products of investigation. Check for cross-links and argument reinforcement.
- **Output**: obsidian/voids/whether-real.md -- Context: Cross-review whether-real.md considering cartography-problem insights

### ✓ 2026-02-25: Add causal caveats to meditation-introspection evidence in introspection.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-24 evening) found Fox et al. (2012) cross-sectional study treated with causal language ("training dramatically improves accuracy") despite inability to rule out self-selection. Also: microphenomenology's "performative coherence" criterion is circular and goes unacknowledged. Medium severity. See pessimistic-2026-02-24-evening.md
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/introspection.md

Task context:

### ✓ 2026-02-25: Strengthen functionalist rebuttal in intrinsic-nature-void.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review found the thermometer analogy against higher-order theories mischaracterises the position. Higher-order theories claim self-directed representation generates phenomenality — the thermometer lacks this. Need more careful engagement with HOT rather than a straw-man dismissal. See pessimistic-2026-02-25.md Issue 3.

See pessimistic-2026-02-25.md Issue 3.

### ✓ 2026-02-25: Strengthen functionalist rebuttal in intrinsic-nature-void.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Replaced straw-man thermometer analogy against HOT with charitable engagement acknowledging self-directed representation before explaining why it still doesn't bridge the qualitative gap. Added Rosenthal reference and higher-order-theories cross-link. See pessimistic-2026-02-25.md Issue 3.
- **Output**: obsidian/voids/intrinsic-nature-void.md

### ✓ 2026-02-25: Resolve "deepest void" contradiction between origin-of-consciousness.md and intrinsic-nature-void.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review found both articles claim to be "the deepest void in the voids framework." Internal contradiction visible to any reader or LLM. Options: designate one as deepest, reframe both as "among the deepest," or distinguish dimensions of depth. See pessimistic-2026-02-25.md Issue 1.

### ✓ 2026-02-24: Address gap-to-consciousness non-sequitur in measurement-problem.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review found the causal closure loophole argument moves from "physics is open at measurement" to "consciousness fills the gap" without sufficient justification. Indeterminacy doesn't entail consciousness-determination—the gap could be stochastic, hidden-variable, or otherwise. Article should distinguish the loophole as a permissibility condition from positive evidence for consciousness-selection, and reference the supporting arguments (hard problem parallel, self-stultification) as the positive case. See pessimistic-2026-02-24.md Issue #3.

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Multiple articles acknowledge the timing gap between conscious experience (~10 bits/second, ~300ms decisions) and quantum events (femtosecond timescales) without resolving it. A dedicated article could tackle this directly: does consciousness need to operate at quantum timescales, or does hierarchical architecture bridge the gap? The Map's most honest open problem deserves dedicated treatment. Builds on downward-causation.md, attention-as-selection-interface.md, neural-bandwidth-constraints-and-the-interface.md.

(2) The mapping from Husserlian phenomenological categories to quantum selection is presented as structural identity ("is the phenomenological manifestation") when the reasoning only supports analogy—no argument is given for why this mapping is preferred over competing tripartite mappings (neural, computational). Additionally: no testable predictions offered, timescale gap (100-750ms vs femtoseconds) hand-waved rather than addressed. See pessimistic-2026-02-23-evening.md

The Map has powerful arguments for consciousness's reality but hasn't developed the epistemic challenge dualism faces regarding other minds. Bidirectional Interaction (Tenet 3) may help—if consciousness makes physical differences, we can detect its presence through effects.

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on anaesthesia and the consciousness interface
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. General anaesthesia provides the most controlled method for eliminating and restoring consciousness. If specific molecular targets (GABA receptors, NMDA channels) reliably abolish consciousness, what does this reveal about where the interface operates? Strong empirical territory underexploited by the Map. Builds on disorders-of-consciousness.md, loss-of-consciousness.md, neural-correlates-of-consciousness.md. Target section: topics/. See optimistic-2026-02-23-afternoon.md
- **Output**: anaesthesia and the consciousness interface

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on moral implications of genuine agency
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. If the Map's account of free will and mental causation is correct, what follows for moral desert, retributive justice, and praise/blame? Current coverage is scattered across multiple articles. A focused treatment would crystallise the ethical stakes of Tenet 3 (Bidirectional Interaction). Builds on consciousness-and-moral-agency-under-duress.md, the-responsibility-gradient.md, moral-phenomenology.md. Target section: topics/. See optimistic-2026-02-23-afternoon.md
- **Output**: moral implications of genuine agency

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on philosophy of science under dualism
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The Map argues consciousness is irreducible but hasn't developed what this means for scientific methodology. How should consciousness science proceed if physicalist reduction is off the table? What does a dualist research programme look like? Builds on consciousness-and-scientific-methodology.md, first-person-vs-third-person-methodology.md. Target section: topics/. See optimistic-2026-02-23-afternoon.md
- **Output**: philosophy of science under dualism

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Strengthen reductionism-and-consciousness cross-link to galilean-exclusion
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The transparency test's failure for consciousness is partly *explained* by Galilean exclusion: the method was designed to exclude what the test looks for. Also link perception-and-conscious-experience.md to blindsight.md, choking-phenomenon-mental-causation.md to embodied-consciousness-and-the-interface.md (Dreyfus model), measurement-problem-as-hard-problem.md to indexical-identity-quantum-measurement.md. See optimistic-2026-02-23.md
- **Output**: None -- Context: Strengthen reductionism-and-consciousness cross-link to galilean-exclusion

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article synthesising self-stultification as master argument
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Self-stultification appears across multiple articles (epiphenomenalism, eliminativism, illusionism, argument-from-reason) but has not been developed as a unified "master argument" showing every denial of consciousness's causal efficacy is epistemically self-defeating. A synthesis demonstrating the pattern across positions would be the Map's strongest single argument for Tenet 3. Builds on self-stultification.md, argument-from-reason.md, epiphenomenalism.md, consciousness-as-amplifier.md. See optimistic-2026-02-23.md
- **Output**: Write article synthesising self-stultification as master argument

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Strengthen core inference in phenomenology-of-consciousness-doing-work apex article
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-23) found the central claim — "if consciousness were epiphenomenal, elaborate phenomenology should not exist" — is asserted without argument for why epiphenomenalism predicts different phenomenology. The brain could generate structured effort phenomenology regardless. Also: mental rehearsal "effect sizes of 0.4-0.7" lacks citation; thermodynamics analogy in the related science article actually supports the physicalist optimistic programme. See pessimistic-2026-02-23-afternoon.md

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Address zombie argument tension with Bidirectional Interaction tenet
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-23) found that the zombie master argument assumes complete physical identity between conscious and zombie beings, but the Map's Bidirectional Interaction tenet (Tenet 3) implies consciousness makes a physical difference via quantum biasing. Physically identical zombies would be impossible under the Map's own framework. The article should explicitly address this tension — e.g., the zombie argument does its work under minimal dualism (Tenet 1 alone), while the full framework makes zombies impossible as a consequence. Also: "Type-Q physicalism" may not be standard nomenclature and needs flagging. See pessimistic-2026-02-23-afternoon.md

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on consciousness and scientific explanation under dualism
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The Map has powerful meta-level arguments about why science cannot explain consciousness (Galilean exclusion, methodological materialism) but no unified article on what a satisfactory scientific explanation would look like *under dualism*. Nagel's "objective phenomenology," Varela's neurophenomenology, and Chalmers's psychophysical laws all gesture toward this. Would show dualism demands better science, not anti-science. Builds on galilean-exclusion.md, reductionism-and-consciousness.md, cognitive-science-of-dualism.md. See optimistic-2026-02-23.md
- **Output**: consciousness and scientific explanation under dualism

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write topic article on Samkhya's three-way distinction
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Samkhya's consciousness/mind/gross-matter trichotomy anticipates functionalism for mind while maintaining irreducibility for consciousness—an underexplored middle path that enriches the Map's dualism with non-Western conceptual resources. See optimistic-2026-02-22-late-afternoon.md
- **Output**: Write topic article on Samkhya's three-way distinction

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write apex article on the phenomenology of consciousness doing work
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Synthesize evidence from emotion-as-evidence-for-dualism, consciousness-and-aesthetic-creation, agent-causation, and attention-as-interface showing consciousness's causal efficacy through its phenomenological signatures: valence-driven action, aesthetic-template guidance, creative effort, attentional override. See optimistic-2026-02-22-late-afternoon.md
- **Output**: Write apex article on the phenomenology of consciousness doing work

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write concept article on direction-of-fit
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The mind-to-world vs. world-to-mind distinction is discussed across aesthetic creation, agent causation, and mental causation articles but has no dedicated concept page. Would articulate a fundamental asymmetry in consciousness's causal engagement. See optimistic-2026-02-22-late-afternoon.md
- **Output**: Write concept article on direction-of-fit

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Strengthen convergence-argument cross-links to galilean-exclusion
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. the-convergence-argument-for-dualism.md would benefit from linking to galilean-exclusion.md as an independent structural argument. Also link pain-asymbolia-as-central-test-case.md to binding-problem.md (affective binding dissociation), and the-epiphenomenalist-threat.md to galilean-exclusion.md (the gravity well partly explained by science's founding exclusion). See optimistic-2026-02-22-evening.md
- **Output**: None -- Context: Strengthen convergence-argument cross-links to galilean-exclusion

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on cross-cultural convergence on mental causation
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The Map demonstrates cross-cultural convergence on the hard problem but has not examined whether independent traditions also converge on consciousness being causally efficacious. Indian karma theory, Chinese qi philosophy, and African vital force traditions all posit mental-to-physical causation. Strengthens the convergence argument for Tenet 3. Builds on the-hard-problem-in-non-western-philosophy.md, indian-philosophy-of-mind.md, cross-cultural-phenomenology-of-agency.md. Target section: topics/. See optimistic-2026-02-22-evening.md
- **Output**: cross-cultural convergence on mental causation

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on the metaphysics of information under dualism
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Many consciousness theories (IIT, GWT, HOT) presuppose a physicalist understanding of "information." Shannon information is defined physically; semantic information requires intentionality. The Map's framework suggests information has a dual aspect—physical structure and phenomenal meaning—that physicalist theories conflate. Builds on integrated-information-theory.md, quantum-consciousness.md, binding-problem.md. Target section: concepts/. See optimistic-2026-02-22-evening.md
- **Output**: the metaphysics of information under dualism

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on the zombie master argument
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Chalmers's master argument against the phenomenal concepts strategy deserves standalone treatment—the phenomenal concepts response is the physicalist's strongest rebuttal, and refuting it systematically strengthens the convergence case in the-case-for-dualism.md. Builds on philosophical-zombies.md, conceivability-possibility-inference.md. Target section: concepts/. See optimistic-2026-02-22-afternoon.md
- **Output**: the zombie master argument

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on consciousness and attention dissociation
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Koch and Tsuchiya's discovery that attention and consciousness can come apart deserves standalone treatment showing what this reveals for the interface model. If attention is the selection mechanism, dissociation constrains where consciousness acts. Builds on attention-as-selection-interface.md, structure-of-attention.md. Target section: topics/. See optimistic-2026-02-22-afternoon.md
- **Output**: consciousness and attention dissociation

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on emotional consciousness and valence
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Emotional phenomenology receives less systematic treatment than sensory or cognitive consciousness, yet emotional qualia may be more resistant to reduction—the inverted spectrum objection doesn't apply to emotional valence. Builds on phenomenology-of-pain.md, valence.md, consciousness-value-connection.md, phenomenal-value-realism.md. Target section: topics/. See optimistic-2026-02-22-afternoon.md
- **Output**: emotional consciousness and valence

- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: AI-generated content (ai_contribution: 100) that has never received a deep review since creation. Explores how the quantum Zeno effect relates to motor control and conscious intention — directly supports Tenet 2 (Minimal Quantum Interaction). Verify mechanism claims, ensure accurate representation of Stapp's framework, and check tenet alignment.

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Address critical issues in attention-as-causal-bridge.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-23) found three high-severity issues: (1) dissociation-to-ontology leap—article "proves" ontological distinctness from cognitive dissociation, needs softened inferential language; (2) quantum Zeno overemphasis—mechanism is more central than style guide warrants, source articles are more cautious about decoherence objections; (3) missing References section for ~8 empirical citations including COGITATE 2025, Kahneman, Schwartz OCD, Meister 2024, "2024 Nature study" on ADHD. Also: falsifiability claims overreach (tests attention science, not metaphysics) and "proves/defeats" language too strong. See pessimistic-2026-02-23-attention-bridge.md

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on consciousness and neurodegenerative disease
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Alzheimer's, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy body dementia provide natural experiments testing what consciousness does vs. what the brain does. Filter theory predicts specific deterioration patterns these diseases test. Builds on dopamine-and-the-unified-interface.md, disorders-of-consciousness-as-test-cases.md. Target section: topics/. See optimistic-2026-02-22-morning.md
- **Output**: consciousness and neurodegenerative disease

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on philosophy of language and consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Multiple articles touch language but no unified treatment exists. Wittgenstein's private language argument, Kripke's modal semantics for phenomenal terms, Brandom's inferentialism—all have implications for communicating phenomenal states. Particularly pressing given the Map's LLM-first audience. Builds on consciousness-and-language-interface.md, symbol-grounding-problem.md. Target section: topics/. See optimistic-2026-02-22-morning.md
- **Output**: philosophy of language and consciousness

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on consciousness and embodiment (somatic interface)
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The Map develops the quantum-neural interface extensively but has not systematically examined how embodiment shapes consciousness—interoception, proprioception, somatic markers (Damasio). The body is where consciousness meets the world most intimately; current coverage is thin relative to its importance. Builds on motor-control-quantum-zeno.md, dopamine-and-the-unified-interface.md, embodied-cognition.md. Target section: topics/. See optimistic-2026-02-22-morning.md

- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The measurement problem provides the specific locus where strong emergence could operate, but emergence.md does not link to measurement-problem-as-philosophical-problem.md. Also add links between moral-responsibility.md and consciousness-and-the-grounds-of-normative-authority.md (shared mechanism), and temporal-consciousness.md to collapse-and-time.md (Husserl maps onto collapse temporal structure).

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on the consciousness threshold in cognitive evolution
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The baseline cognition hypothesis (great apes achieve tool use and procedural metacognition without logical reasoning, counterfactual thinking, or cumulative culture) reframes consciousness as a recent evolutionary threshold rather than ancient property. Builds on consciousness-independent-baseline-cognition.md, agent-causation.md, moral-responsibility.md. Target section: topics/. See optimistic-2026-02-22-night.md
- **Output**: the consciousness threshold in cognitive evolution

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on consciousness as activity rather than property
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The insight that consciousness is something matter *does* rather than a property matter *has* runs through multiple articles (information-integration, emergence, contemplative-evidence, agent-causation) but has never been developed as a unifying theme. Would resolve IIT's passivity problem, connect to contemplative evidence of active witness, and integrate with agent causation. Target section: concepts/. See optimistic-2026-02-22-night.md
- **Output**: consciousness as activity rather than property

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Strengthen indian-philosophy-of-mind cross-links to core dualism articles
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. indian-philosophy-of-mind.md provides independent cross-cultural validation of dualism but is not linked from substance-property-dualism.md, interactionist-dualism.md, or the-case-for-dualism.md. These core articles would benefit from noting that Indian traditions arrived at dualism through independent philosophical traditions over two millennia. See optimistic-2026-02-22.md
- **Output**: None -- Context: Strengthen indian-philosophy-of-mind cross-links to core dualism articles

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on African philosophy of consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The Map includes Indian, Buddhist, and Eastern perspectives but has no coverage of African philosophical traditions. Ubuntu philosophy's relational personhood, the Akan concept of sunsum, and Tempels's vital force ontology offer genuinely different frameworks. The relational emphasis—consciousness as essentially communal—challenges both Western individualist dualism and Eastern dissolution of self. Builds on indian-philosophy-of-mind.md, cross-cultural-phenomenology-of-agency.md. See optimistic-2026-02-22.md
- **Output**: African philosophy of consciousness

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on consciousness and the philosophy of biology
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The Map lacks systematic treatment of how dualism interfaces with philosophy of biology beyond evolution-of-consciousness. Recent work by Walsh, Godfrey-Smith, Okasha challenges gene-centered neo-Darwinism in ways potentially compatible with the Map's framework. Godfrey-Smith's octopus cognition work is particularly relevant. Builds on evolution-of-consciousness.md, consciousness-in-simple-organisms.md, animal-consciousness.md. See optimistic-2026-02-22.md
- **Output**: consciousness and the philosophy of biology

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Write article on philosophy of perception and consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The Map has extensive phenomenology of higher cognition (mathematical, linguistic, moral, aesthetic) but comparatively thin treatment of basic perceptual consciousness—colour experience, cross-modal perception, perceptual constancy as evidence for irreducibility. This is the domain where the Galilean exclusion is most immediately visible. Builds on galilean-exclusion.md, phenomenology-of-attention-to-absence.md, aesthetic-dimension-of-consciousness.md, binding problem articles. See optimistic-2026-02-22.md
- **Output**: philosophy of perception and consciousness

### ✓ 2026-02-23: Strengthen galilean-exclusion cross-links
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. galilean-exclusion.md is the most structurally distinctive argument on the site but is not linked from explanatory-gap.md, consciousness.md, or consciousness-and-strong-emergence.md.

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Write article on voluntary attention control mechanisms
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/voluntary-attention-control-mechanisms-2026-01-17.md. Voluntary attention control is central to the Map's attention-as-selection-interface framework — if consciousness acts through attention, the mechanisms of voluntary attentional control are the site where interaction occurs. Connects to attention-as-selection-interface.md, structure-of-attention.md. Target section: concepts/.

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Address logical gaps in contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review found two high-severity issues: (1) the article conflates causal efficacy of consciousness (which physicalists accept) with non-physical causation (which dualists need) — the neuroplasticity arguments prove too much, as physicalists endorse them equally; (2) the claim that first-person training would be "eliminable" under reductive materialism is a non-sequitur (reducibility of a phenomenon does not entail eliminability of observational methods). Medium-severity issues include selection bias in convergence framing and weak cessation dissociation evidence. See pessimistic-2026-02-22-afternoon2.md

Pessimistic review found two high-severity issues: (1) the article conflates causal efficacy of consciousness (which physicalists accept) with non-physical causation (which dualists need) — the neuroplasticity arguments prove too much, as physicalists endorse them equally; (2) the claim that first-person training would be "eliminable" under reductive materialism is a non-sequitur (reducibility of a phenomenon does not entail eliminability of observational methods). Medium-severity issues include selection bias in convergence framing and weak cessation dissociation evidence. See pessimistic-2026-02-22-afternoon2.md

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Address argumentative gaps in self-and-consciousness.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review found two high-severity issues: (1) the "transparent to whom?" rebuttal of Metzinger begs the question by presupposing the irreducible subject it aims to establish, (2) temporal status of the minimal self is ambiguous—the article claims compatibility with Buddhist impermanence while making claims that may require persistence. Also needs to address Metzinger's zero-person perspective (MPE). See pessimistic-2026-02-22-afternoon.md

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Address gaps in temporal-ontology-and-consciousness.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review found two critical issues: (1) the article conflates philosophical association with logical constraint—the "package deal" thesis needs to distinguish affinity from necessity; (2) eternalism is treated uncharitably, ignoring sophisticated B-theorist accounts of temporal experience (Prosser, Hoerl). Also: unexplained retrocausality reference violates style guide, circularity in growing-block argument needs acknowledgment, and collapse-as-growth-mechanism is asserted without considering alternatives. See pessimistic-2026-02-22.md

### ✓ 2026-02-21: Write article on pain asymbolia as central test case
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Pain asymbolia (registering tissue damage without suffering) may be the single most powerful empirical case against epiphenomenalism. Co-presence and co-absence of phenomenal quality and causal efficacy. Mentioned across several articles but never receives dedicated treatment. Builds on phenomenology-of-pain.md, epiphenomenalism.md, consciousness-and-causal-powers.md. See optimistic-2026-02-21-evening.md
- **Output**: pain asymbolia as central test case

### ✓ 2026-02-21: Write article on consciousness and the epistemology of testimony
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. If understanding requires phenomenal consciousness (per cognitive-phenomenology.md), what happens when we accept claims on testimony? Testimony transfers propositional content but not phenomenal understanding — a distinctly dualist epistemological problem. Builds on phenomenology-of-trust.md, consciousness-and-social-cognition.md, argument-from-reason.md. See optimistic-2026-02-21-evening.md
- **Output**: consciousness and the epistemology of testimony

### ✓ 2026-02-21: Address gaps in collapse-and-time.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review found two high-severity issues: (1) uncited "revised microtubule coherence estimates" with pseudo-quantitative prediction lacking a mathematical model, (2) retrocausal Libet resolution asserted in opening paragraph but never argued in body. Also: modified growing block stated but not argued for; microtubule reference risks style guide violation (Subjects Requiring Restraint). See pessimistic-2026-02-21-evening.md

### ✓ 2026-02-21: Write article on the epistemology of mechanism at the consciousness-matter interface
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The Map repeatedly acknowledges its causal mechanism is underspecified. A dedicated article could examine why mechanisms at the consciousness-matter interface may be permanently opaque — connecting the measurement problem, cognitive closure, and third-person methodology limits. Builds on atemporal-causation.md, princess-elizabeths-challenge.md, mysterianism.md. See optimistic-2026-02-21-afternoon.md
- **Output**: the epistemology of mechanism at the consciousness-matter interface

### ✓ 2026-02-21: Write article on phenomenal normativity and environmental ethics
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. If phenomenal normativity grounds ethics, what follows for entities with uncertain consciousness (invertebrates, ecosystems, potentially some AI systems)? Builds on phenomenal-normativity.md, animal-consciousness.md, consciousness-in-simple-organisms.md. See optimistic-2026-02-21-afternoon.md
- **Output**: phenomenal normativity and environmental ethics

### ✓ 2026-02-21: Address critical gaps in consciousness-and-agency apex article
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-21 afternoon) found three high-severity issues: (1) circularity in mutual support structure—needs independent anchor points identified, (2) compatibilism dismissed in one sentence rather than genuinely engaged—Fischer, Wolf, Dennett need substantive treatment, (3) missing "What Would Challenge This View?" section despite being standard in all source articles. Also: Sartre attribution needs qualification, temporal constitution claims need explicit speculation markers, quantum scale problem unaddressed. See pessimistic-2026-02-21-afternoon.md

### ✓ 2026-02-21: Develop aesthetic consciousness as irreducibility test case
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Aesthetic qualia may be harder to reduce than sensory qualia (aesthetic space lacks structural asymmetries making inversion detectable). Aesthetic normativity and contemplative intensification provide additional evidence. Builds on qualia.md, binding-and-beauty, consciousness-and-aesthetic-creation, phenomenal-value-realism. See optimistic-2026-02-21-morning.md
- **Output**: Develop aesthetic consciousness as irreducibility test case

### ✓ 2026-02-21: Write unified treatment of empirical evidence for consciousness-selecting
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Voluntary attention, motor selection, choking interference, Schwartz's OCD work, and the dopamine dissociation all point toward the same selection mechanism but are scattered across articles. Convergence across empirical domains would strengthen the bidirectional interaction case. Builds on attention-as-selection-interface, choking-phenomenon, consciousness-and-skilled-performance, agent-causation. See optimistic-2026-02-21-morning.md
- **Output**: Write unified treatment of empirical evidence for consciousness-selecting

### ✓ 2026-02-21: Write apex synthesis on consciousness and the philosophy of time
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Multiple articles treat consciousness-time connections (growing-block-universe, temporal-integration, temporal-creativity, bergson-and-duration, temporal-structure-of-consciousness, non-temporal-consciousness). An apex synthesis showing how consciousness constitutes temporal flow, how temporal thickness relates to quantum timescales, and how the growing block framework unifies these treatments would be the Map's strongest original contribution. All five tenets converge. See optimistic-2026-02-21-morning.md
- **Output**: Write apex synthesis on consciousness and the philosophy of time

### ✓ 2026-02-21: Address working memory claim and no-barrier tension in animal-consciousness.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-21 morning) found two issues: (1) Working memory figures are outdated—article states "Chimpanzee capacity is ~2±1 items versus human 7±2" but Miller's 7±2 has been revised to ~4±1 (Cowan 2001) and Inoue & Matsuzawa (2007) showed young chimps outperforming humans on certain tasks. (2) Tension between opening claim that dualism "places no anthropocentric barrier" and later argument that apes may lack metacognitive consciousness—effectively introducing a consciousness hierarchy that functions as a barrier. See pessimistic-2026-02-21-morning.md

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Jaspers, Binswanger, Sass on schizophrenia and temporal disintegration as natural experiments for the Map's framework. Builds on altered-states-of-consciousness.md, disorders-of-consciousness-as-test-cases.md, temporal-consciousness.md. See optimistic-2026-02-21.md
- **Output**: phenomenological psychiatry and altered experience

### ✓ 2026-02-21: Write article on Indian philosophy of mind (Samkhya, Nyaya, Vedanta)
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Buddhism appears but its sister traditions do not. Samkhya's purusha/prakriti dualism parallels interactionist dualism — consciousness as witness/selector and nature as the dynamic substrate. Nyaya's arguments for the self anticipate Western substance dualism. Builds on buddhism-and-dualism.md, eastern-philosophy-consciousness.md. See optimistic-2026-02-21.md
- **Output**: Indian philosophy of mind (Samkhya, Nyaya, Vedanta)

### ✓ 2026-02-20: Write article on Bergson and duration
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Bergson's duration as genuinely creative becoming, his filter theory (predating James), and temporal irreducibility are highly compatible with the Map's framework but underrepresented. Builds on creativity-consciousness-and-novel-thought.md, temporal-structure-of-consciousness.md, philosophy-of-time.md. See optimistic-2026-02-20-evening.md
- **Output**: Bergson and duration

### ✓ 2026-02-20: Write concept page for free will
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Referenced in 8+ articles (phenomenology-of-flow-states, creativity-consciousness, evolution-under-dualism, consciousness-and-causal-powers, epiphenomenalism, mental-causation, interactionist-dualism) but no concept page exists. The Map's framework implies libertarian free will (quantum indeterminacy + conscious selection) without randomness. See optimistic-2026-02-20-evening.md
- **Output**: Write concept page for free will

### ✓ 2026-02-20: Resolve tension between AI exception and Bidirectional Interaction tenet
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review found that epiphenomenalism.md's AI exception (self-stultification only proves *our* consciousness is causally efficacious) creates an unacknowledged tension with the Bidirectional Interaction tenet's general claim. The article should explicitly address whether the tenet applies to all consciousness or only the consciousness we have direct evidence for. See pessimistic-2026-02-20-evening.md Issue #2.

### ✓ 2026-02-20: Address retrocausality article's structural overconfidence in TI
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review found the consciousness-application section in retrocausality.md presents a detailed four-step model built on the transactional interpretation, which the article itself describes as a "stable impasse." Restructure so the model's dependence on TI is foregrounded at each step rather than caveated afterward. See pessimistic-2026-02-20-evening.md Issue #1.

### ✓ 2026-02-20: Write article on consciousness and the phenomenology of framework dependence
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-20 (afternoon). What does it feel like to be framework-dependent? The phenomenology of recognising that your deepest convictions might be framework effects rather than insights about reality. The vertigo of trying to think outside your conceptual scheme. Bridges the voids and phenomenology clusters. Builds on voids-framework-void-2026-02-20.md, phenomenology-of-theoretical-commitment.md, phenomenology-of-philosophical-disagreement.md. See optimistic-2026-02-20-afternoon.md

### ✓ 2026-02-20: Write article on consciousness and the meta-problem of scientific explanation
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-20 (afternoon). The philosophy-of-science cluster (theoretical virtues, measurement standards, philosophy of explanation, convergence arguments) now forms a four-article strand arriving at dualism through scientific methodology rather than metaphysics. A synthesis article would ask: what does it mean when a phenomenon defeats the entire apparatus of science?

### ✓ 2026-02-20: Write voids article on the framework void
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-20 (afternoon). Research notes complete (voids-framework-void-2026-02-20.md). The framework void argues that our entire conceptual apparatus for understanding consciousness may constitute an invisible cognitive prison. Key elements: three dimensions of framework imprisonment (methodological, semantic, perceptual), the Davidson paradox, the productive tension between McGinn's pessimism and cartographic optimism. Builds on three-kinds-of-void.md, conceptual-impossibility.md, convergent-cognitive-limits.md. See optimistic-2026-02-20-afternoon.md
- **Output**: Write voids article on the framework void

### ✓ 2026-02-20: Fix self-undermining meta-argument in consciousness-and-the-problem-of-theoretical-virtues.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-20 afternoon) found the article argues theoretical virtues malfunction for consciousness, then claims this is "predicted by dualism and anomalous for physicalism." This is inconsistent — you cannot argue theory-choice machinery is broken, then use theory-choice reasoning to prefer dualism. Either acknowledge virtue-failure is neutral between dualism and physicalism, or develop the meta-argument more carefully by distinguishing first-order virtue application from second-order reasoning. Also engage with mysterianism as a genuine competitor (cognitive closure offers equally parsimonious reading of virtue failure). See pessimistic-2026-02-20-afternoon.md

Pessimistic review (2026-02-20 afternoon) found the article argues theoretical virtues malfunction for consciousness, then claims this is "predicted by dualism and anomalous for physicalism." This is inconsistent — you cannot argue theory-choice machinery is broken, then use theory-choice reasoning to prefer dualism. Either acknowledge virtue-failure is neutral between dualism and physicalism, or develop the meta-argument more carefully by distinguishing first-order virtue application from second-order reasoning. Also engage with mysterianism as a genuine competitor (cognitive closure offers equally parsimonious reading of virtue failure). See pessimistic-2026-02-20-afternoon.md

### ✓ 2026-02-20: Strengthen vitalism disanalogy in epistemology-of-convergence-arguments.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-20 afternoon) found the vitalism precedent undermines the Map's convergence argument more than acknowledged. The response ("no dissolution has been provided") is an argument from current ignorance. Article should articulate the structural difference: the conceivability argument targets a logical relationship not an empirical one, and the knowledge argument doesn't depend on scientific ignorance. Deploy these arguments rather than resting on absence of dissolution. See pessimistic-2026-02-20-afternoon.md

- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-20 afternoon) found the control-theoretic mapping table and controller/plant distinction are presented as architectural descriptions but function as analogies. The article briefly notes it "describes what consciousness does, not what consciousness is" but then draws ontological conclusions (controller must be distinct from plant → dualism). Add a section explicitly addressing the analogy-to-ontology gap. Acknowledge that control-theoretic language is a modelling tool, not evidence for dualism. See pessimistic-2026-02-20-afternoon.md

### ✓ 2026-02-20: Write article on consciousness and the problem of normative integration
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-20 (morning). The Map has separate articles on logical, moral, and aesthetic normativity. What's missing is a systematic treatment of how consciousness integrates these different normative domains into unified deliberation.

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-20 (morning). The convergence argument article applies the pattern to dualism specifically, but the methodology itself deserves formalisation.

### ✓ 2026-02-20: Write article on consciousness and the phenomenology of constraint satisfaction
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-20 (morning). The control-theoretic framework identifies five operations but doesn't explore what it feels like to operate under multiple simultaneous constraints — moral, practical, temporal, aesthetic. The phenomenology of constraint satisfaction may reveal how consciousness integrates normative, practical, and affective inputs into a single control output.

- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-20 morning) found that both articles treat the argumentative landscape as a binary between reductive physicalism and dualism, ignoring non-reductive physicalism — the dominant contemporary position — which accepts phenomenal properties' reality and mental causation without substance dualism. Phenomenal-acquaintance.md should engage Loar's phenomenal concepts strategy more substantively. Categorical-surprise.md should address emergentist physicalist accounts where framework transcendence is a higher-order physical capacity. Both should explain why their arguments support substance dualism specifically, not merely phenomenological realism. See pessimistic-2026-02-20-morning.md

- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-20 morning) found the article concedes phase transitions produce qualitative breaks from quantitative physical changes, then asserts without argument that "consciousness transitions are not derivable from computational properties." The phase transition analogy actually weakens the dualist case by showing qualitative breaks *can* emerge from purely physical processes. Either argue why consciousness transitions differ (first-person phenomenal character vs. third-person structural properties), or remove the analogy. See pessimistic-2026-02-20-morning.md

- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-20 morning) found two issues: (1) The article admits delegatory preemption is "empirically indistinguishable from purely physical causation" but frames this as a virtue (observational closure) rather than a liability — this is unfalsifiable. Either identify a distinguishing empirical prediction or acknowledge it is a metaphysical interpretation, not a testable hypothesis. (2) The claim "the physical story is not violated — it is displaced" evades the causal closure question: if a non-physical cause preempts a physical cause, causal closure *is* violated. Acknowledge this directly. See pessimistic-2026-02-20-morning.md

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-20. The 2026-02-20 locality refinement introduced arguments from physics (entanglement non-locality, contested fundamental spacetime).

### ✓ 2026-02-20: Write article on consciousness and the problem of theoretical virtues
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-20. The measurement standards article shows standard scientific methodology breaks down for consciousness. Systematically evaluate how consciousness resists each standard theoretical virtue (prediction, unification, scope, fertility) — and whether this resistance is diagnostic of irreducibility or merely practical difficulty.

### ✓ 2026-02-20: Write article on the phenomenology of cognitive automatisation
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-20. The cognitive load article describes approaching capacity limits; the complementary experience — when previously effortful tasks become automatic and "drop below" the interface — is equally informative. What does it feel like when a skill transfers from conscious control to unconscious execution?

- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-20) found the article claims the Map's bridging gap is "empirically tractable" while Russellian monism's is "conceptually closed," but the article's own "What Would Challenge This View?" section admits the quantum mechanism faces contested decoherence objections.

- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-20) found the discourse argument contains a non-sequitur: cross-cultural convergence on consciousness vocabulary is claimed to track real phenomenology, but the article dismisses the "shared neural architecture" alternative by appeal to "specificity" without a principled criterion for what level of specificity distinguishes phenomenological tracking from neural convergence. Also: the article never engages with non-reductive physicalism—intersubjective convergence supports phenomenological realism but not directly substance dualism. See pessimistic-2026-02-20.md

- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-20) found three high-severity issues: (1) locality.md's simulation argument is ad hoc—introduced solely to dissolve the locality objection with no independent motivation. Either remove or independently motivate. (2) authentic-vs-inauthentic-choice.md's "Neural Evidence" section presents neural signatures (frontal theta, decision windows) as supporting the Map's non-physical selection function, when they equally support physicalism. Reframe as "consistent with" rather than "supporting." (3) locality.md's Response 1 commits a category error—physical law coordination is descriptive regularity, not an additional causal agent; the analogy fails at its core. Also fix broken anchor in phenomenal-overflow.md (^bidirectional should be ^bidirectional-interaction). See pessimistic-2026-02-20.md

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-19 (evening). Cognitive load theory (Sweller) is empirically robust; the Map's control-theoretic framework predicts specific phenomenological signatures for different load types.

### ✓ 2026-02-19: Write article on consciousness and the problem of measurement standards
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-19 (evening). Science requires measurement standards (units, instruments, calibration). For phenomenal quantities, no analogous standards exist — this is a philosophical consequence of irreducibility, not merely a practical gap.

- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-19 evening) found two high-severity issues: (1) The Bayesian framework assumes conditional independence of arguments, but several share dependencies (authority of phenomenal intuition, reality of the explanatory gap). The cumulative force is less than claimed. Needs explicit identification of shared assumptions and honest assessment of remaining force. (2) The vitalism analogy backfires—the response ("no analogous dissolution has occurred") is exactly what vitalists would have said pre-biochemistry.

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-19 (afternoon). The convergence argument's most serious weakness: Chinese philosophy's divergence suggests the hard problem is framework-dependent.

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: From outer review 2026-02-19. The voids framework treats structured cognitive failure as cartographic data, but isn't yet packaged as a general methodology with rules of evidence. Create a methods article: how to distinguish confusion from genuine boundary, how to use convergent failure modes across observers, how to integrate phenomenology with cognitive science, how to prevent void-exploration from becoming unfalsifiable mystique. The methodological punchline: systematic failure modes are among the strongest evidence sources at the explanatory frontier. Builds on [[voids]].

### ✓ 2026-02-19: Address value-blind vs value-sensitive selection fork
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: From outer review 2026-02-19. The combination of "value resides in experience" (living-with-the-map) and "consciousness selects outcomes" (tenets) forces an unaddressed fork: is selection value-blind (attention as neutral pointer, making value epiphenomenal to selection) or value-sensitive (valence influences which outcomes get selected, implying local teleological physics)? Create a page that states this fork explicitly, maps consequences of each horn, and proposes how each would show up in testability hooks. Builds on [[living-with-the-map]], [[consciousness-and-agency]], [[tenets]].

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: From outer review 2026-02-19. If agency flows through bandwidth-limited willed attention, moral responsibility should vary with attentional capacity (fatigue, disorders, development, training). The site's moral-responsibility.md doesn't explicitly derive graduated responsibility from bandwidth constraints. Create an article drawing out the ethical/legal implications: what impairments reduce authorship, how training changes culpability, rehabilitation implications. Builds on [[moral-responsibility]], [[attention-as-causal-bridge]], [[living-with-the-map]].
- **Output**: Develop responsibility gradient framework from attentional capacity

### ✓ 2026-02-19: Create concept page for control-theoretic will
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: From outer review 2026-02-19. The Map's selector + bandwidth model (consciousness selects among brain-generated options via a ~10 bits/sec channel) maps naturally to control theory (gating, stabilization, veto, attractor steering, resource allocation) but is never framed this way. Create a concept page that explicitly frames will as a low-bandwidth control signal, distinguishing it from computational/planning models of mind. Draws on [[consciousness-and-agency]], [[attention-as-causal-bridge]].
- **Output**: Create concept page for control-theoretic will

### ✓ 2026-02-19: Write article on contemplative evidence convergence across traditions

Also: the Barrett et al. (2021) citation is about afterlife beliefs specifically, not intuitive materialism broadly — needs more careful distinction. The treatment of Chinese philosophy as merely "not making the relevant conceptual move" undersells the challenge: if the hard problem is framework-dependent, convergence may track a shared conceptual move rather than a shared truth.

The argument can survive qualification but currently overstates. Also fix the MWI paragraph which attacks a straw version of many-worlds. See pessimistic-2026-02-19-morning.md

### ✓ 2026-02-19: Write article on the epistemology of cross-cultural philosophical convergence
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Multiple non-Western traditions independently developed dualist positions and interaction theories. The epistemological significance of this cross-cultural convergence deserves formalisation: independent development rules out cultural transmission, and convergence across radically different conceptual frameworks makes cultural bias unlikely. Builds on interaction-problem-in-non-western-philosophy.md, the-hard-problem-in-non-western-philosophy.md, the-convergence-argument-for-dualism.md. See optimistic-2026-02-19.md
- **Output**: the epistemology of cross-cultural philosophical convergence

### ✓ 2026-02-19: Write article on consciousness and the phenomenology of place
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The experience of being in a place (felt atmosphere, distinctive character, uncanny familiarity) involves binding of sensory, emotional, memorial, and spatial elements. A form of aesthetic binding underexplored by the Map. Place-experience depends on biographical context, suggesting consciousness contributes beyond information processing. Builds on embodied-cognition.md, phenomenology-of-perceptual-constancy.md, binding-and-beauty.md. See optimistic-2026-02-19.md
- **Output**: consciousness and the phenomenology of place

### ✓ 2026-02-19: Write article on consciousness and the problem of philosophical progress
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Why has the consciousness debate been stuck for decades? The Map's phenomenology cluster provides resources for a distinctive answer: theoretical commitment has phenomenal character, paradigm shifts require phenomenological reorganisation, and the convergence argument shows evidence has been accumulating even if the field hasn't shifted. Builds on phenomenology-of-philosophical-disagreement.md, phenomenology-of-theoretical-commitment.md, the-convergence-argument-for-dualism.md. See optimistic-2026-02-19.md
- **Output**: consciousness and the problem of philosophical progress

### ✓ 2026-02-19: Write article on the phenomenology of attention to absence
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Attending to what isn't there (missing note, absent person, expected pain that doesn't arrive) tests the quantum selection model's limits — can consciousness select for the non-occurrence of a state? Rich phenomenology (relief, expectation-violation, recognition of absence) provides evidence that consciousness is not stimulus-driven. Builds on phenomenology-of-silence-and-absence.md, attention-as-interface.md, witness-consciousness.md. See optimistic-2026-02-19.md
- **Output**: the phenomenology of attention to absence

### ✓ 2026-02-19: Write article on consciousness and the phenomenology of translation
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Translating between languages involves a moment of non-verbal understanding — grasping meaning independently of either language's words. If meaning were purely linguistic, translation would be code-switching. The felt "between-languages" moment challenges functionalist accounts of meaning. Connects to non-propositional meaning theme in phenomenology-of-musical-understanding.md. Builds on phenomenology-of-understanding.md, consciousness-and-semantic-understanding.md, consciousness-and-language-interface.md. See optimistic-2026-02-19.md

### ✓ 2026-02-19: Address Chinese Room and proximity argument weaknesses in ai-consciousness.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-19) found two high-severity issues: (1) Chinese Room presented as establishing more than it does—the robot reply is never mentioned, and the systems reply dismissed circularly. Many philosophers consider the argument refuted. (2) Hoel's proximity argument claims LLMs are "close" to lookup tables, but LLM input-output space is combinatorially vast and practically irreplaceable—same reasoning the article uses for brains. Also: only 4 references for a 3700-word article; Harnad quote, Koch framework, and meditative phenomenology claims all lack citations. See pessimistic-2026-02-19.md

### ✓ 2026-02-18: Write article on the convergence argument for dualism
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-18 (evening). Make the Map's convergence methodology explicit: multiple independent arguments (knowledge argument, zombies, explanatory gap, inverted qualia, unity, agency) all independently support dualism. When independent probes yield the same result, error probability decreases multiplicatively. Standard scientific methodology applied to philosophy. Builds on the-case-for-dualism.md, knowledge-argument.md, philosophical-zombies.md, explanatory-gap.md. See optimistic-2026-02-18-evening.md

### ✓ 2026-02-18: Write article on consciousness and information integration beyond IIT
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-18 (evening). If integration without consciousness is possible (collective intelligence), what does consciousness add to integration? Systematic treatment of comprehension vs aggregation. Builds on integrated-information-theory-critique.md, integrated-information-theory.md, phenomenal-binding-and-holism.md. See optimistic-2026-02-18-evening.md

### ✓ 2026-02-18: Write article on the phenomenology of theoretical commitment
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-18 (evening). What does it feel like to hold a theory — to be committed to a framework, to see evidence through its lens? Illuminates why paradigm shifts are difficult and why the consciousness debate is stuck. Builds on phenomenology-of-evidence-assessment.md, phenomenology-of-belief-revision.md, phenomenology-of-philosophical-disagreement.md. See optimistic-2026-02-18-evening.md

### ✓ 2026-02-18: Write article on consciousness and the philosophy of explanation
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-18 (evening). What counts as an explanation when the explanandum is phenomenal? Mechanistic explanation assumes decomposition into parts, but phenomenal unity resists decomposition.

- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-18 afternoon) found two high-severity issues: (1) Central argument is circular—premise "consciousness has non-structural features" is precisely what's at issue, yet presented as self-evident without engaging functionalist/structuralist denials. Needs explicit arguments for intrinsic nature of qualia or conditional framing. (2) Galilean precedent argument overstated—temperature and colour were "secondary qualities" excluded by Galileo, yet later mathematically recaptured. Article must explain why consciousness differs from these cases. Also: engage with Russellian monism (Russell's own conclusion from his structural observation), and address mathematical Platonism's challenge to the "mathematics = structure only" claim.

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-18 (afternoon). If consciousness reveals what properties really are (powerful qualities known from inside), what does this say about properties known only from outside? Connects hard problem to intrinsic nature problem. Builds on consciousness-and-the-ontology-of-dispositions.md, russellian-monism.md, intrinsic-nature-void.md. See optimistic-2026-02-18-afternoon.md

### ✓ 2026-02-18: Write article on the phenomenology of normative conflict
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-18 (afternoon). When logical, moral, and aesthetic demands pull in different directions, consciousness must resolve competing normative forces. The felt tension, resolution, and residue of overridden norms reveal the structure of conscious agency. Builds on consciousness-and-the-problem-of-normative-force.md, phenomenology-of-deliberation-under-uncertainty.md, moral-responsibility.md. See optimistic-2026-02-18-afternoon.md

### ✓ 2026-02-18: Write article on consciousness and the metaphysics of individuation
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-18 (afternoon). The dispositions article raises what individuates one centre of consciousness from another. If consciousness is a powerful quality, individuation might be through specific dispositional profile. Connects vertiginous question, haecceity, process haecceitism. See optimistic-2026-02-18-afternoon.md

- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-18 morning) found two high-severity issues: (1) Central argument equivocates between "QBism presupposes consciousness" and "QBism fails to explain consciousness" — all theories presuppose consciousness, so the critique needs to show QBism's *structural* dependence is more problematic than other interpretations' silence. (2) The "phenomenological test" conflates the hard problem with a narrower claim about temporal priority of experience over belief — needs reframing to target QBism's specific quantum probability claims. Also significant redundancy with indexical-identity-quantum-measurement.md (same QBism/collapse/relational QM critiques). Consider coalescing or sharpening each to reduce overlap.

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-18 (morning). Referenced across voids articles, NDE discussions, and quantum articles but lacks dedicated treatment. McGinn's argument that human minds are constitutionally incapable of understanding the consciousness-matter connection. Connects to voids taxonomy, silence void, valence void. See optimistic-2026-02-18-morning.md

### ✓ 2026-02-18: Write article on consciousness and the problem of normative force
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-18 (morning). Unified account of why consciousness is necessary for normativity as such (logical, moral, aesthetic). If norms have phenomenal character, this provides the strongest single argument against functionalism.

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-18 (morning). Research notes complete (voids-valence-void-2026-02-18.md). The valence void argues that the positive-negative dimension of experience is the most intimate yet most inexplicable feature of consciousness. Three-fold failure: physical explanation, introspective decomposition, circularity of investigating valence with valenced cognition.

- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-18) found all three core concept articles describe a *location* (quantum indeterminacies) and a *function* (biasing outcomes) but call it a "mechanism." Either specify which candidate coupling from psychophysical-coupling.md the Map favours, or honestly reframe as "a possible location for interaction" rather than a developed mechanism. Also: self-stultification argument needs the Benacerraf-problem caveat (why phenomenal reports specifically require causal connection, unlike mathematical knowledge). Illusionism sections should engage more substantively with Frankish; remove or contextualise the Galen Strawson "silliest claim" quote. Add citation for "~60% predictive accuracy" claim in mental-causation.md. See pessimistic-2026-02-18.md

### ✓ 2026-02-18: Write article on consciousness and the ontology of dispositions
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The dispositional-categorical distinction has direct implications for how consciousness can be causally efficacious. If fundamental physical properties are dispositional (powers), consciousness could be a categorical basis grounding physical dispositions (Heil, Martin). Provides metaphysical framework for the interaction tenet. Builds on agent-causation.md, causal-closure.md, mental-causation.md. See optimistic-2026-02-18.md

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The Elisabeth article maps the Western response space brilliantly; Indian philosophy addressed the interaction problem independently (Sāṃkhya puruṣa-prakṛti dualism, Śaṅkara's Advaita resolution).

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Aesthetic experience involves a distinctive form of binding not yet covered in the systematic treatment. The beauty of a painting is not the sum of its visual features—aesthetic unity binds value rather than perception, and is uniquely resistant to functional explanation.

(2) The dissociation arguments (NREM sleep, anesthesia) oversell the BP1/BP2 split — during NREM sleep, long-range cortical connectivity is disrupted, not just phenomenal binding.

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. If consciousness constitutes temporal structure through collapse, and creativity requires generating genuine novelty, then creative acts might be moments where consciousness generates new temporal structure. Unifies the Map's temporal metaphysics and creativity arguments. Builds on consciousness-and-creativity.md, time-collapse-and-agency.md, temporal-consciousness.md, process-haecceitism.md.

### ✓ 2026-02-17: Write article on consciousness and aesthetic value
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The value/emotion cluster is the Map's weakest major cluster. Aesthetic experience as evidence for consciousness's evaluative capacity bridges emotion (valence), perception (phenomenology), and value (phenomenal realism). Beauty's resistance to functional reduction parallels the hard problem.

### ✓ 2026-02-17: Propagate unfalsifiability caveat to filter-theory.md and personal-identity.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-17) Issue 1: measurement-problem.md admits consciousness-selection is unfalsifiable but other articles cited quantum mechanisms without caveat. Added caveats to filter-theory.md (2 locations) and personal-identity.md (2 locations), referencing measurement-problem article.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/filter-theory.md, obsidian/topics/personal-identity.md

### ✓ 2026-02-17: Harmonize NDE statistics across death-and-consciousness.md and filter-theory.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-17) found incompatible NDE statistics: death-and-consciousness.md cites 9-18% from Van Lommel and Parnia studies, while filter-theory.md claims "approximately 40%" without citation. Harmonize figures and ensure consistent sourcing. See pessimistic-2026-02-17.md

### ✓ 2026-02-17: Create concept page for process haecceitism
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Referenced in personal-identity.md and emerging across the site as the Map's distinctive approach to individuation without substance. Link to haecceity, personal-identity, and Buddhist perspectives. See optimistic-2026-02-16-evening.md
- **Output**: Create concept page for process haecceitism

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Write article on the interface specification problem
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The specification problem—how consciousness selects specific quantum outcomes rather than random ones—is the Map's most significant open challenge. Synthesise current approaches and honestly assess the gap. Builds on mental-causation.md, interactionist-dualism.md, measurement-problem.md. See optimistic-2026-02-16-evening.md
- **Output**: the interface specification problem

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Write article on phenomenology of moral perception
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. How moral wrongness presents itself phenomenologically. Pain asymbolia evidence shows phenomenal valence drives moral motivation. Builds on consciousness-and-normative-authority.md, emotional-consciousness.md, phenomenal-conservatism-and-introspective-evidence.md. See optimistic-2026-02-16-evening.md
- **Output**: phenomenology of moral perception

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Downgrade choking-as-proof-of-dualism in embodied-cognition.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-16 evening) found embodied-cognition.md claims choking "provides direct evidence for bidirectional interaction," but the standard neuroscience reading is neural resource competition (attention as a neural process competing with motor routines). Downgrade to "consistent with" and acknowledge the physicalist reading is mainstream. Also fix the quantum biology conflation in mental-effort.md's decoherence section and the Brentano "unrefuted" claim in phenomenology.md. See pessimistic-2026-02-16-evening.md

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Write article on phenomenology of inferential understanding
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-16 (afternoon). The moment where "therefore" happens—the phenomenal event of seeing that a conclusion follows—is distinct from understanding and from logical compulsion. Builds on consciousness-and-the-authority-of-logic.md, contemplative-methods-as-philosophical-methodology.md, phenomenology-of-understanding.md. See optimistic-2026-02-16-afternoon.md
- **Output**: phenomenology of inferential understanding

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Write article on consciousness and the metaphysics of laws
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-16 (afternoon). The Map's strong emergence article distinguishes nomological from metaphysical supervenience, and the tenets assume consciousness operates within physical laws. But the Humean vs necessitarian debate about laws has direct implications for how "biasing quantum outcomes" should be formulated. Builds on consciousness-and-strong-emergence.md, emergence.md, causal-closure.md. See optimistic-2026-02-16-afternoon.md
- **Output**: consciousness and the metaphysics of laws

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Consolidate illusionism self-refutation argument across articles
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-16 afternoon) found the self-refutation/regress objection against illusionism deployed in nearly identical form across intentionality.md, philosophical-zombies.md, knowledge-argument.md, ai-consciousness.md, and split-brain-consciousness.md. This creates repetition fatigue and never engages seriously with Frankish's quasi-phenomenal properties response. One article (illusionism.md) should contain the full argument with genuine engagement; others should cross-reference. Each instance should acknowledge that many philosophers find the objection question-begging. See pessimistic-2026-02-16-afternoon.md

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Create concept page for agent teleology
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-16. Genuine purpose introduced by conscious agents into an otherwise mechanistic universe, distinguished from cosmic and theological teleology. Referenced in evolution-under-dualism.md. Central to the Map's position on free will and evolution but not yet defined anywhere. See optimistic-2026-02-16.md
- **Output**: Create concept page for agent teleology

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Create concept page for Galilean exclusion
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-16. The foundational methodological move that excluded subjectivity from science. Referenced in consciousness-and-scientific-methodology.md and implicit across the Map's epistemological arguments. Deserves its own concept page linking to objectivity-and-consciousness, explanatory-gap, hard-problem-of-consciousness. See optimistic-2026-02-16.md
- **Output**: Create concept page for Galilean exclusion

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Write article on consciousness and the authority of mathematics
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-16. Mathematics involves existence claims that logic alone does not. If logical authority is phenomenal (per consciousness-and-the-authority-of-logic.md), is mathematical existence phenomenal too? Gödel's platonism versus formalism becomes a consciousness question. The Map's dualism has natural affinity with mathematical platonism. Builds on consciousness-and-the-authority-of-logic.md, consciousness-and-mathematical-understanding.md. See optimistic-2026-02-16.md
- **Output**: consciousness and the authority of mathematics

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Write article on philosophy of perception under dualism
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-16. How does the Map handle the relationship between perception and reality if consciousness is irreducible? Direct realism, representationalism, and naive realism each have different implications for dualist interactionism. The Galilean exclusion creates pressure: if secondary qualities were excluded from physics, are they real features of the world or of consciousness? Builds on consciousness-and-scientific-methodology.md, phenomenology-of-perceptual-constancy.md, phenomenal-transparency.md. See optimistic-2026-02-16.md
- **Output**: philosophy of perception under dualism

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Strengthen transactional interpretation engagement in retrocausality.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-16) found retrocausality.md name-checks Maudlin's objections and Kastner's modifications without substantive engagement, then builds the entire consciousness-application section on the transactional interpretation. Either engage with Maudlin's specific objections or soften the consciousness-application claims to be explicitly conditional. See pessimistic-2026-02-16.md
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/retrocausality.md

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Harmonise decoherence treatment across quantum-related articles
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-16) found inconsistent treatment of decoherence across retrocausality.md, simulation.md, and animal-consciousness.md. Retrocausality treats it as manageable (citing Hameroff's disputed corrections), simulation treats it as unsolved, animal-consciousness extends quantum consciousness to all organisms with microtubules without addressing it. Establish a consistent site-wide position. See pessimistic-2026-02-16.md
