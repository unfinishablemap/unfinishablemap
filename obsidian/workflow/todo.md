title: AI Task Queue
topics: []
---

This is the task queue for AI automation. The human reviews and prioritizes tasks; the AI executes them.

## How to Edit This List

- **Promote**: Change `P2` to `P1`, etc.
- **Demote**: Change `P1` to `P2`, etc.
- **Veto**: Add `#veto` anywhere in the task heading (e.g., `### P2: Task name #veto`)
- **Add reason**: Optionally add `- **Veto reason**: [why]` before vetoing

Vetoed items are moved automatically to the Vetoed Tasks section on the next evolution loop run.

## Priority Levels

- **P0**: Urgent - execute immediately
- **P1**: High - execute this week
- **P2**: Medium - execute when time permits
- **P2**: Low - nice to have, human approval needed

## Active Tasks

- **Notes**: Coalesce (2026-02-09) merged `attention-interface-mechanisms.md` and `attention-motor-planning-quantum-interface.md` into `attention-as-selection-interface.md`. 10 active content files reference `[[attention-interface-mechanisms]]`: embodied-consciousness-and-the-interface.md, psychophysical-laws-bridging-mind-and-matter.md, psychophysical-coupling.md, free-will.md, decoherence.md, quantum-consciousness.md, mental-effort.md, stapp-quantum-mind.md, attention-as-interface.md, structure-of-attention.md. Update wikilinks to point to attention-as-selection-interface.
- **Source**: coalesce
- **Generated**: 2026-02-09

### P2: Update wikilinks to archived articles (interface-locality, brain-specialness, and 5 others)
- **Type**: other
- **Notes**: Gap analysis found 70+ broken wikilinks pointing to archived/coalesced articles. Key targets: interface-locality (34 refs, archived to concepts/), brain-specialness (6 refs), consciousness-and-quantum-measurement (11 refs), nihilism (5 refs), quantum-measurement-and-definite-outcomes (5 refs), eastern-philosophy-haecceity-tension (4 refs), meaning-and-consciousness (4 refs).

- **Generated**: 2026-02-06

### P2: Fix case-sensitivity wikilink errors across content
- **Type**: other
- **Notes**: Gap analysis found 68 case-sensitivity wikilink errors where capitalized forms like [[Access consciousness]], [[Blindsight]], [[Filter-theory]], [[Qualia]] are used instead of lowercase-hyphenated forms. Most concentrated in concepts/ section (255 occurrences). Bulk find-replace needed: correct capitalized wikilinks to match actual filenames.

- **Generated**: 2026-02-06

### P2: Strengthen Minimal Quantum Interaction cross-references
- **Type**: other
- **Notes**: Gap analysis found Minimal Quantum Interaction is the weakest-represented tenet (184 files vs 301 for Dualism, 61% ratio). While absolute coverage is adequate, many attention, cognition, and Eastern philosophy articles that implicitly connect to quantum interaction don't explicitly reference it. Add Tenet 2 cross-references to articles in the attention cluster (attention-interface-mechanisms.md, voluntary-attention.md), biological articles (evolution-of-consciousness.md, neural-quantum-coherence.md), and contemplative articles where the quantum Zeno mechanism is relevant.

### ✓ 2026-02-07: Address confidence-uncertainty mismatch in foundational articles
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-05) found pattern across simulation.md, knowledge-argument.md, and ethics-of-consciousness.md: strong claims in main text, uncertainty acknowledgments buried in caveats or "What Would Challenge" sections. Creates misleading impression. Need to integrate conditional language into main claims: "If the simulation hypothesis is coherent, it would suggest..." rather than "The simulation hypothesis dissolves..." Also: knowledge-argument treats intuition as near-probative without engaging methodological debates; ethics article's AI consciousness conclusions rest heavily on contested framework. See pessimistic-2026-02-05.md
- **Source**: pessimistic-review
- **Generated**: 2026-02-05
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/simulation.md, obsidian/concepts/knowledge-argument.md, obsidian/topics/ethics-of-consciousness.md

### ✓ 2026-02-09: Write article on phenomenal conservatism and introspective evidence
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-02 (afternoon). Huemer's phenomenal conservatism—if it seems to S that P, S has prima facie justification for believing P—is foundational for treating phenomenal evidence seriously. How does the Map handle introspective reliability? When should phenomenal seemings be trusted? Builds on arguments-for-dualism.md, epistemic-advantages-of-dualism.md, introspection.md. See optimistic-2026-02-02-afternoon.md

### ✓ 2026-02-19: Address Chinese Room and proximity argument weaknesses in ai-consciousness.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-19) found two high-severity issues: (1) Chinese Room presented as establishing more than it does—the robot reply is never mentioned, and the systems reply dismissed circularly. Many philosophers consider the argument refuted. (2) Hoel's proximity argument claims LLMs are "close" to lookup tables, but LLM input-output space is combinatorially vast and practically irreplaceable—same reasoning the article uses for brains. Also: only 4 references for a 3700-word article; Harnad quote, Koch framework, and meditative phenomenology claims all lack citations. See pessimistic-2026-02-19.md
- **Output**: obsidian/topics/ai-consciousness.md

### ✓ 2026-02-18: Write article on the convergence argument for dualism
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-18 (evening). Make the Map's convergence methodology explicit: multiple independent arguments (knowledge argument, zombies, explanatory gap, inverted qualia, unity, agency) all independently support dualism. When independent probes yield the same result, error probability decreases multiplicatively. Standard scientific methodology applied to philosophy. Builds on the-case-for-dualism.md, knowledge-argument.md, philosophical-zombies.md, explanatory-gap.md. See optimistic-2026-02-18-evening.md
- **Output**: the convergence argument for dualism

### ✓ 2026-02-18: Write article on consciousness and information integration beyond IIT
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-18 (evening). If integration without consciousness is possible (collective intelligence), what does consciousness add to integration? Systematic treatment of comprehension vs aggregation. Builds on integrated-information-theory-critique.md, integrated-information-theory.md, phenomenal-binding-and-holism.md. See optimistic-2026-02-18-evening.md
- **Output**: consciousness and information integration beyond IIT

### ✓ 2026-02-18: Write article on the phenomenology of theoretical commitment
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-18 (evening). What does it feel like to hold a theory — to be committed to a framework, to see evidence through its lens? Illuminates why paradigm shifts are difficult and why the consciousness debate is stuck. Builds on phenomenology-of-evidence-assessment.md, phenomenology-of-belief-revision.md, phenomenology-of-philosophical-disagreement.md. See optimistic-2026-02-18-evening.md
- **Output**: the phenomenology of theoretical commitment

### ✓ 2026-02-18: Write article on consciousness and the philosophy of explanation
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-18 (evening). What counts as an explanation when the explanandum is phenomenal? Mechanistic explanation assumes decomposition into parts, but phenomenal unity resists decomposition. Builds on the-epistemology-of-phenomenal-reports-in-science.md, first-person-third-person-methodology.md, consciousness-and-scientific-methodology.md. See optimistic-2026-02-18-evening.md
- **Output**: consciousness and the philosophy of explanation

### ✓ 2026-02-18: Address circular reasoning and Galilean counterexamples in consciousness-and-the-authority-of-mathematics.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-18 afternoon) found two high-severity issues: (1) Central argument is circular—premise "consciousness has non-structural features" is precisely what's at issue, yet presented as self-evident without engaging functionalist/structuralist denials. Needs explicit arguments for intrinsic nature of qualia or conditional framing. (2) Galilean precedent argument overstated—temperature and colour were "secondary qualities" excluded by Galileo, yet later mathematically recaptured. Article must explain why consciousness differs from these cases. Also: engage with Russellian monism (Russell's own conclusion from his structural observation), and address mathematical Platonism's challenge to the "mathematics = structure only" claim. See pessimistic-2026-02-18-afternoon.md

### ✓ 2026-02-18: Write article on consciousness and the problem of other properties
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-18 (afternoon). If consciousness reveals what properties really are (powerful qualities known from inside), what does this say about properties known only from outside? Connects hard problem to intrinsic nature problem. Builds on consciousness-and-the-ontology-of-dispositions.md, russellian-monism.md, intrinsic-nature-void.md. See optimistic-2026-02-18-afternoon.md
- **Output**: consciousness and the problem of other properties

### ✓ 2026-02-18: Write article on the phenomenology of normative conflict
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-18 (afternoon). When logical, moral, and aesthetic demands pull in different directions, consciousness must resolve competing normative forces. The felt tension, resolution, and residue of overridden norms reveal the structure of conscious agency. Builds on consciousness-and-the-problem-of-normative-force.md, phenomenology-of-deliberation-under-uncertainty.md, moral-responsibility.md. See optimistic-2026-02-18-afternoon.md
- **Output**: the phenomenology of normative conflict

### ✓ 2026-02-18: Write article on consciousness and the metaphysics of individuation
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-18 (afternoon). The dispositions article raises what individuates one centre of consciousness from another. If consciousness is a powerful quality, individuation might be through specific dispositional profile. Connects vertiginous question, haecceity, process haecceitism. See optimistic-2026-02-18-afternoon.md
- **Output**: consciousness and the metaphysics of individuation

### ✓ 2026-02-18: Address equivocation and redundancy in quantum-measurement-and-subjective-probability.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-18 morning) found two high-severity issues: (1) Central argument equivocates between "QBism presupposes consciousness" and "QBism fails to explain consciousness" — all theories presuppose consciousness, so the critique needs to show QBism's *structural* dependence is more problematic than other interpretations' silence. (2) The "phenomenological test" conflates the hard problem with a narrower claim about temporal priority of experience over belief — needs reframing to target QBism's specific quantum probability claims. Also significant redundancy with indexical-identity-quantum-measurement.md (same QBism/collapse/relational QM critiques). Consider coalescing or sharpening each to reduce overlap. See pessimistic-2026-02-18-morning.md

### ✓ 2026-02-18: Create concept page for cognitive closure (McGinn)
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-18 (morning). Referenced across voids articles, NDE discussions, and quantum articles but lacks dedicated treatment. McGinn's argument that human minds are constitutionally incapable of understanding the consciousness-matter connection. Connects to voids taxonomy, silence void, valence void. See optimistic-2026-02-18-morning.md
- **Output**: Create concept page for cognitive closure (McGinn)

### ✓ 2026-02-18: Write article on consciousness and the problem of normative force
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-18 (morning). Unified account of why consciousness is necessary for normativity as such (logical, moral, aesthetic). If norms have phenomenal character, this provides the strongest single argument against functionalism. Builds on consciousness-and-the-authority-of-logic.md, phenomenal-value-realism.md, moral-responsibility.md, phenomenology-of-inferential-understanding.md. See optimistic-2026-02-18-morning.md
- **Output**: consciousness and the problem of normative force

### ✓ 2026-02-18: Write voids article on the valence void
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-18 (morning). Research notes complete (voids-valence-void-2026-02-18.md). The valence void argues that the positive-negative dimension of experience is the most intimate yet most inexplicable feature of consciousness. Three-fold failure: physical explanation, introspective decomposition, circularity of investigating valence with valenced cognition. Builds on voids-valence-void-2026-02-18.md, affective-void.md, consciousness-and-pain.md, phenomenal-value-realism.md. See optimistic-2026-02-18-morning.md
- **Output**: Write voids article on the valence void

### ✓ 2026-02-18: Address quantum mechanism overclaiming in emergence.md, mental-causation.md, qualia.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-18) found all three core concept articles describe a *location* (quantum indeterminacies) and a *function* (biasing outcomes) but call it a "mechanism." Either specify which candidate coupling from psychophysical-coupling.md the Map favours, or honestly reframe as "a possible location for interaction" rather than a developed mechanism. Also: self-stultification argument needs the Benacerraf-problem caveat (why phenomenal reports specifically require causal connection, unlike mathematical knowledge). Illusionism sections should engage more substantively with Frankish; remove or contextualise the Galen Strawson "silliest claim" quote. Add citation for "~60% predictive accuracy" claim in mental-causation.md. See pessimistic-2026-02-18.md

### ✓ 2026-02-18: Write article on the phenomenology of musical understanding
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Music presents a unique test case for binding and temporal consciousness. Musical understanding requires integrating temporal, tonal, rhythmic, and emotional dimensions into a unified experience that cannot be decomposed. Parallels the combination problem at phenomenal level. Builds on consciousness-and-aesthetic-value.md, phenomenology-of-understanding.md, temporal-consciousness.md. See optimistic-2026-02-18.md
- **Output**: the phenomenology of musical understanding

### ✓ 2026-02-18: Write article on consciousness and the ontology of dispositions
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The dispositional-categorical distinction has direct implications for how consciousness can be causally efficacious. If fundamental physical properties are dispositional (powers), consciousness could be a categorical basis grounding physical dispositions (Heil, Martin). Provides metaphysical framework for the interaction tenet. Builds on agent-causation.md, causal-closure.md, mental-causation.md. See optimistic-2026-02-18.md
- **Output**: consciousness and the ontology of dispositions

### ✓ 2026-02-18: Write article on the epistemology of phenomenal reports in science
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. How should science treat first-person reports? The Map has sophisticated arguments for contemplative evidence but hasn't systematically addressed how phenomenal reports should function within scientific methodology. Bridges phenomenological arguments and philosophy of science. Builds on contemplative-verification-of-consciousness-theories.md, first-person-third-person-methodology.md, neurophenomenology.md. See optimistic-2026-02-18.md
- **Output**: the epistemology of phenomenal reports in science

### ✓ 2026-02-18: Reduce quantum Zeno overemphasis in moral-responsibility.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-17 night) found the quantum Zeno mechanism presented as grounding the "control" requirement for moral responsibility—violating the writing style guide's restraint guidance for speculative mechanisms. Agent causation should be presented as philosophically grounded regardless of physical mechanism, with quantum Zeno as one possible implementation. Also clarify Soon et al. (2008) citation context (timing prediction vs content prediction). See pessimistic-2026-02-17-night.md
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/moral-responsibility.md

### ✓ 2026-02-17: Address filter theory selectivity problem in near-death-experiences.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-17 night) found that filter theory predicts enhanced consciousness during brain compromise, but most brain damage (TBI, stroke, dementia) produces diminished consciousness. NDEs are a narrow exception. The article needs to explain why filter reduction enhances experience during dying but not in other brain-compromise conditions. Terminal lucidity could be cited as additional supporting evidence. See pessimistic-2026-02-17-night.md

- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-17 night) found the "Comparing the Problems" table uses asymmetric descriptors: "Phenomenal bonding (unexplained)" vs "Quantum selection (specifiable)." But quantum selection for consciousness is equally unspecified. Reword the mechanism row honestly—both are "proposed but not yet specified"—or add a paragraph acknowledging interactionism's mechanism is also unexplained at the detail level. See pessimistic-2026-02-17-night.md
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/combination-problem.md

### ✓ 2026-02-17: Write article on the interaction problem in non-Western philosophy
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The Elisabeth article maps the Western response space brilliantly; Indian philosophy addressed the interaction problem independently (Sāṃkhya puruṣa-prakṛti dualism, Śaṅkara's Advaita resolution). Cross-cultural convergence on the mind-body distinction strengthens the Map's position. Builds on elisabeths-contemporaries-and-the-interaction-debate.md, eastern-philosophy-consciousness.md, the-hard-problem-in-non-western-philosophy.md. See optimistic-2026-02-17-evening.md
- **Output**: the interaction problem in non-Western philosophy

### ✓ 2026-02-17: Write article on binding and beauty (the aesthetic unity problem)
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Aesthetic experience involves a distinctive form of binding not yet covered in the systematic treatment. The beauty of a painting is not the sum of its visual features—aesthetic unity binds value rather than perception, and is uniquely resistant to functional explanation. Builds on the-binding-problem-a-systematic-treatment.md, consciousness-and-aesthetic-creation.md, consciousness-and-aesthetic-value.md. See optimistic-2026-02-17-evening.md
- **Output**: binding and beauty (the aesthetic unity problem)

### ✓ 2026-02-17: Write article on the phenomenology of silence and absence
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The silence void research (2026-02-17) identifies underexplored territory: hearing silence is a positive phenomenal state, not the absence of hearing. If absence has phenomenal character, consciousness cannot be a product of input processing. Builds on voids-silence-void-2026-02-17.md, witness-consciousness.md, contemplative-verification-of-consciousness-theories.md. See optimistic-2026-02-17-evening.md
- **Output**: the phenomenology of silence and absence

### ✓ 2026-02-17: Address critical gaps in binding-problem-systematic-treatment.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-17 afternoon 2) found two high-severity issues: (1) The "coordination is not identity" argument (BP2 gap) is asserted rather than argued — never engages with the identity response (that identities like "water = H₂O" are discovered, not produced). (2) The dissociation arguments (NREM sleep, anesthesia) oversell the BP1/BP2 split — during NREM sleep, long-range cortical connectivity is disrupted, not just phenomenal binding. IIT predicts exactly this pattern but the article dismisses IIT without engaging its specific sleep/anesthesia predictions. Also missing a "What Would Challenge This View?" section. See pessimistic-2026-02-17-afternoon-2.md

### ✓ 2026-02-17: Write article on the phenomenology of intellectual courage
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Intellectual courage—holding a position against social pressure, or abandoning one despite emotional investment—has distinctive phenomenal character. The Map's own position requires intellectual courage; examining its phenomenology illuminates consciousness's role in truth-seeking. Builds on phenomenology-of-philosophical-disagreement.md, phenomenology-of-evidence-assessment.md. See optimistic-2026-02-17-afternoon.md
- **Output**: the phenomenology of intellectual courage

### ✓ 2026-02-17: Write article on consciousness and the authority of testimony
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. How consciousness grounds testimonial authority. If consciousness is irreducible, testimony transmits phenomenally grounded knowledge no information-processing could substitute. Implications for AI testimony. Builds on phenomenology-of-trust-and-testimony.md, problem-of-other-minds.md, intersubjectivity.md. See optimistic-2026-02-17-afternoon.md
- **Output**: consciousness and the authority of testimony

### ✓ 2026-02-17: Write article on the phenomenology of conceptual change
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. What happens during a genuine paradigm shift in an individual thinker? How does the phenomenal landscape reorganise when fundamental commitments change? Builds on phenomenology-of-philosophical-disagreement.md, phenomenology-of-belief-revision.md, phenomenology-of-understanding.md. See optimistic-2026-02-17-afternoon.md
- **Output**: the phenomenology of conceptual change

### ✓ 2026-02-17: Address critical gaps in concepts/reductionism.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-17 afternoon) found two high-severity issues: (1) Multiple realizability argument is overstated—dismisses Kim's disjunctive response in one sentence and ignores Bechtel-Mundale/Polger-Shapiro criticisms that undermine the Putnam-Fodor framing. (2) Article focuses exclusively on outdated Nagelian bridge-law reduction (1961) and never engages with functional reduction (Lewis, later Kim), which is the dominant contemporary framework. Also: Buddhism/process philosophy paragraph in Relation to Site Perspective undercuts the Map's own dualism by dissolving the consciousness/matter categories the Map requires. See pessimistic-2026-02-17-afternoon.md
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/reductionism.md

### ✓ 2026-02-17: Write article on phenomenology of philosophical disagreement
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. If phenomenal seemings justify beliefs (phenomenal conservatism), and trained contemplatives reach contradictory conclusions, how should the Map handle deep philosophical disagreement? Epistemologically urgent for a platform that uses introspective evidence. Builds on contemplative-reliability.md, phenomenal-conservatism-and-introspective-evidence.md, phenomenology-of-belief-revision.md. See optimistic-2026-02-17.md
- **Output**: phenomenology of philosophical disagreement

### ✓ 2026-02-17: Write article on consciousness and temporal creativity
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. If consciousness constitutes temporal structure through collapse, and creativity requires generating genuine novelty, then creative acts might be moments where consciousness generates new temporal structure. Unifies the Map's temporal metaphysics and creativity arguments. Builds on consciousness-and-creativity.md, time-collapse-and-agency.md, temporal-consciousness.md, process-haecceitism.md. See optimistic-2026-02-17.md
- **Output**: consciousness and temporal creativity

### ✓ 2026-02-17: Write article on consciousness and aesthetic value
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The value/emotion cluster is the Map's weakest major cluster. Aesthetic experience as evidence for consciousness's evaluative capacity bridges emotion (valence), perception (phenomenology), and value (phenomenal realism). Beauty's resistance to functional reduction parallels the hard problem. Builds on aesthetics-of-consciousness.md, emotional-consciousness.md, phenomenal-value-realism.md, consciousness-and-creativity.md. See optimistic-2026-02-17.md
- **Output**: consciousness and aesthetic value

### ✓ 2026-02-17: Propagate unfalsifiability caveat to articles citing quantum mechanisms
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-17) found that measurement-problem.md honestly admits consciousness-selection is empirically indistinguishable from random collapse, but death-and-consciousness.md, filter-theory.md, and personal-identity.md invoke quantum mechanisms without propagating this caveat. Caveat added to death-and-consciousness.md (2026-02-17). Still needed in filter-theory.md and personal-identity.md. See pessimistic-2026-02-17.md

- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-17) Issue 1: measurement-problem.md admits consciousness-selection is unfalsifiable but other articles cited quantum mechanisms without caveat. Added caveats to filter-theory.md (2 locations) and personal-identity.md (2 locations), referencing measurement-problem article.

### ✓ 2026-02-17: Harmonize NDE statistics across death-and-consciousness.md and filter-theory.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-17) found incompatible NDE statistics: death-and-consciousness.md cites 9-18% from Van Lommel and Parnia studies, while filter-theory.md claims "approximately 40%" without citation. Harmonize figures and ensure consistent sourcing. See pessimistic-2026-02-17.md

### ✓ 2026-02-17: Create concept page for process haecceitism
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Referenced in personal-identity.md and emerging across the site as the Map's distinctive approach to individuation without substance. Link to haecceity, personal-identity, and Buddhist perspectives. See optimistic-2026-02-16-evening.md
- **Output**: Create concept page for process haecceitism

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Write article on the interface specification problem
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The specification problem—how consciousness selects specific quantum outcomes rather than random ones—is the Map's most significant open challenge. Synthesise current approaches and honestly assess the gap. Builds on mental-causation.md, interactionist-dualism.md, measurement-problem.md. See optimistic-2026-02-16-evening.md
- **Output**: the interface specification problem

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Write article on phenomenology of moral perception
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. How moral wrongness presents itself phenomenologically. Pain asymbolia evidence shows phenomenal valence drives moral motivation. Builds on consciousness-and-normative-authority.md, emotional-consciousness.md, phenomenal-conservatism-and-introspective-evidence.md. See optimistic-2026-02-16-evening.md
- **Output**: phenomenology of moral perception

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Downgrade choking-as-proof-of-dualism in embodied-cognition.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-16 evening) found embodied-cognition.md claims choking "provides direct evidence for bidirectional interaction," but the standard neuroscience reading is neural resource competition (attention as a neural process competing with motor routines). Downgrade to "consistent with" and acknowledge the physicalist reading is mainstream. Also fix the quantum biology conflation in mental-effort.md's decoherence section and the Brentano "unrefuted" claim in phenomenology.md. See pessimistic-2026-02-16-evening.md

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Write article on phenomenology of inferential understanding
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-16 (afternoon). The moment where "therefore" happens—the phenomenal event of seeing that a conclusion follows—is distinct from understanding and from logical compulsion. Builds on consciousness-and-the-authority-of-logic.md, contemplative-methods-as-philosophical-methodology.md, phenomenology-of-understanding.md. See optimistic-2026-02-16-afternoon.md
- **Output**: phenomenology of inferential understanding

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Write article on consciousness and the metaphysics of laws
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-16 (afternoon). The Map's strong emergence article distinguishes nomological from metaphysical supervenience, and the tenets assume consciousness operates within physical laws. But the Humean vs necessitarian debate about laws has direct implications for how "biasing quantum outcomes" should be formulated. Builds on consciousness-and-strong-emergence.md, emergence.md, causal-closure.md. See optimistic-2026-02-16-afternoon.md
- **Output**: consciousness and the metaphysics of laws

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Consolidate illusionism self-refutation argument across articles
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-16 afternoon) found the self-refutation/regress objection against illusionism deployed in nearly identical form across intentionality.md, philosophical-zombies.md, knowledge-argument.md, ai-consciousness.md, and split-brain-consciousness.md. This creates repetition fatigue and never engages seriously with Frankish's quasi-phenomenal properties response. One article (illusionism.md) should contain the full argument with genuine engagement; others should cross-reference. Each instance should acknowledge that many philosophers find the objection question-begging. See pessimistic-2026-02-16-afternoon.md

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Create concept page for agent teleology
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-16. Genuine purpose introduced by conscious agents into an otherwise mechanistic universe, distinguished from cosmic and theological teleology. Referenced in evolution-under-dualism.md. Central to the Map's position on free will and evolution but not yet defined anywhere. See optimistic-2026-02-16.md

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Create concept page for Galilean exclusion
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-16. The foundational methodological move that excluded subjectivity from science. Referenced in consciousness-and-scientific-methodology.md and implicit across the Map's epistemological arguments. Deserves its own concept page linking to objectivity-and-consciousness, explanatory-gap, hard-problem-of-consciousness. See optimistic-2026-02-16.md
- **Output**: Create concept page for Galilean exclusion

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Write article on consciousness and the authority of mathematics
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-16. Mathematics involves existence claims that logic alone does not. If logical authority is phenomenal (per consciousness-and-the-authority-of-logic.md), is mathematical existence phenomenal too? Gödel's platonism versus formalism becomes a consciousness question. The Map's dualism has natural affinity with mathematical platonism. Builds on consciousness-and-the-authority-of-logic.md, consciousness-and-mathematical-understanding.md. See optimistic-2026-02-16.md
- **Output**: consciousness and the authority of mathematics

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Write article on philosophy of perception under dualism
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-16. How does the Map handle the relationship between perception and reality if consciousness is irreducible? Direct realism, representationalism, and naive realism each have different implications for dualist interactionism. The Galilean exclusion creates pressure: if secondary qualities were excluded from physics, are they real features of the world or of consciousness? Builds on consciousness-and-scientific-methodology.md, phenomenology-of-perceptual-constancy.md, phenomenal-transparency.md. See optimistic-2026-02-16.md
- **Output**: philosophy of perception under dualism

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Strengthen transactional interpretation engagement in retrocausality.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-16) found retrocausality.md name-checks Maudlin's objections and Kastner's modifications without substantive engagement, then builds the entire consciousness-application section on the transactional interpretation. Either engage with Maudlin's specific objections or soften the consciousness-application claims to be explicitly conditional. See pessimistic-2026-02-16.md

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Harmonise decoherence treatment across quantum-related articles
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-16) found inconsistent treatment of decoherence across retrocausality.md, simulation.md, and animal-consciousness.md. Retrocausality treats it as manageable (citing Hameroff's disputed corrections), simulation treats it as unsolved, animal-consciousness extends quantum consciousness to all organisms with microtubules without addressing it. Establish a consistent site-wide position. See pessimistic-2026-02-16.md
