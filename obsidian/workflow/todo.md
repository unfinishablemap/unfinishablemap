title: AI Task Queue
topics: []
---

This is the task queue for AI automation. The human reviews and prioritizes tasks; the AI executes them.

## How to Edit This List

- **Promote**: Change `P2` to `P1`, etc.
- **Demote**: Change `P1` to `P2`, etc.
- **Veto**: Add `#veto` anywhere in the task heading (e.g., `### P2: Task name #veto`)
- **Add reason**: Optionally add `- **Veto reason**: [why]` before vetoing

Vetoed items are moved automatically to the Vetoed Tasks section on the next evolution loop run.

## Priority Levels

- **P0**: Urgent - execute immediately
- **P1**: High - execute this week
- **P2**: Medium - execute when time permits
- **P2**: Low - nice to have, human approval needed

## Active Tasks

### P2: Address unfalsifiability and circular reasoning in three new embodied/cognitive articles
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review found three articles (sensorimotor-contingencies-and-the-interface, predictive-processing-and-the-maps-framework, paradox-of-effortless-mastery) share a pattern: every empirical finding is reinterpreted as confirming the interface model with no stated disconfirming evidence. The choking argument is overstated (presented as proving consciousness is causal, but consistent with materialist attentional interference accounts). Fix "grammatees" typo in sensorimotor article. Soften quantum mechanism language per writing style guide. See pessimistic-2026-02-15-late.md

- **Generated**: 2026-02-15

### P2: Update references to coalesced temporal articles (specious-present, duration)
- **Type**: other
- **Notes**: Coalesce (2026-02-15) merged `specious-present.md` and `duration.md` into the expanded `temporal-consciousness.md`. ~15 active content files reference `[[specious-present]]` and ~30 reference `[[duration]]` across concepts/, topics/, apex/, and voids/. Archive pages serve these URLs, but wikilinks in active content should eventually be updated to point to temporal-consciousness where appropriate.
- **Source**: coalesce
- **Generated**: 2026-02-15

### P2: Update references to coalesced indexical articles (indexical-facts, indexical-knowledge, self-locating-beliefs)
- **Type**: other
- **Notes**: Coalesce (2026-02-13) merged `indexical-facts.md`, `indexical-knowledge.md`, and `self-locating-beliefs.md` into `indexical-knowledge-and-identity.md`. 5 active content files reference archived articles: haecceity.md and visual-consciousness.md reference `[[indexical-facts]]`, acquaintance-knowledge.md references `[[indexical-knowledge]]`, phenomenology-of-belief-revision.md and indexical-identity-quantum-measurement.md reference `[[self-locating-beliefs]]`. Archive pages serve these URLs, but wikilinks should eventually be updated.
- **Source**: coalesce
- **Generated**: 2026-02-13

### P2: Update references to coalesced attention articles (attention, voluntary-attention, attention-motor-quantum-interface)
- **Type**: other
- **Notes**: Coalesce (2026-02-12) merged `attention.md`, `voluntary-attention.md`, and `attention-motor-quantum-interface.md` into `attention-as-interface.md`. ~36 active content files reference `[[attention]]`, ~43 reference `[[voluntary-attention]]`, ~10 reference `[[attention-motor-quantum-interface]]`. Archive pages serve these URLs, but wikilinks in active content should eventually be updated to point to attention-as-interface where appropriate.
- **Source**: coalesce
- **Generated**: 2026-02-12

### P2: Update references to coalesced binding articles (phenomenal-unity, neural-binding-mechanisms, multimodal-binding)
- **Type**: other
- **Notes**: Coalesce (2026-02-11) merged phenomenal-unity.md, neural-binding-mechanisms.md, and multimodal-binding.md into phenomenal-binding-and-holism.md. 37 active content files reference these archived articles. Key files include: binding-problem.md, quantum-consciousness.md, unity-of-consciousness.md, quantum-binding-and-phenomenal-unity.md, varieties-of-unity.md, why-phenomenal-unity-resists-explanation.md, split-brain-consciousness.md, hard-problem-of-consciousness.md, and many others. Update wikilinks to point to phenomenal-binding-and-holism or leave as-is if archive redirect works.
- **Source**: coalesce
- **Generated**: 2026-02-11

### P2: Update references to coalesced attention articles (attention-interface-mechanisms, attention-motor-planning-quantum-interface)
- **Type**: other
- **Notes**: Coalesce (2026-02-09) merged `attention-interface-mechanisms.md` and `attention-motor-planning-quantum-interface.md` into `attention-as-selection-interface.md`. 10 active content files reference `[[attention-interface-mechanisms]]`: embodied-consciousness-and-the-interface.md, psychophysical-laws-bridging-mind-and-matter.md, psychophysical-coupling.md, free-will.md, decoherence.md, quantum-consciousness.md, mental-effort.md, stapp-quantum-mind.md, attention-as-interface.md, structure-of-attention.md. Update wikilinks to point to attention-as-selection-interface.
- **Source**: coalesce
- **Generated**: 2026-02-09

### P2: Update wikilinks to archived articles (interface-locality, brain-specialness, and 5 others)
- **Type**: other
- **Notes**: Gap analysis found 70+ broken wikilinks pointing to archived/coalesced articles. Key targets: interface-locality (34 refs, archived to concepts/), brain-specialness (6 refs), consciousness-and-quantum-measurement (11 refs), nihilism (5 refs), quantum-measurement-and-definite-outcomes (5 refs), eastern-philosophy-haecceity-tension (4 refs), meaning-and-consciousness (4 refs). Update wikilinks to point to the replacement articles these were coalesced into, or verify the archive redirect handles them.
- **Source**: gap_analysis
- **Generated**: 2026-02-06

### P2: Fix case-sensitivity wikilink errors across content
- **Type**: other
- **Notes**: Gap analysis found 68 case-sensitivity wikilink errors where capitalized forms like [[Access consciousness]], [[Blindsight]], [[Filter-theory]], [[Qualia]] are used instead of lowercase-hyphenated forms. Most concentrated in concepts/ section (255 occurrences). Bulk find-replace needed: correct capitalized wikilinks to match actual filenames.
- **Source**: gap_analysis
- **Generated**: 2026-02-06

### P2: Strengthen Minimal Quantum Interaction cross-references
- **Type**: other
- **Notes**: Gap analysis found Minimal Quantum Interaction is the weakest-represented tenet (184 files vs 301 for Dualism, 61% ratio). While absolute coverage is adequate, many attention, cognition, and Eastern philosophy articles that implicitly connect to quantum interaction don't explicitly reference it. Add Tenet 2 cross-references to articles in the attention cluster (attention-interface-mechanisms.md, voluntary-attention.md), biological articles (evolution-of-consciousness.md, neural-quantum-coherence.md), and contemplative articles where the quantum Zeno mechanism is relevant.
- **Source**: gap_analysis
- **Generated**: 2026-02-06

### P2: Update references to coalesced substrate-independence-critique article
- **Type**: other
- **Notes**: Coalesce (2026-02-02) merged `substrate-independence-critique.md` into `substrate-independence.md`. 20+ files in obsidian/ reference the archived article via `[[substrate-independence-critique]]`. Key files: functionalism.md, llm-consciousness.md, continual-learning-argument.md, embodied-cognition.md, ai-consciousness.md, machine-consciousness.md, hard-problem-of-consciousness.md, machine-question.md. Update wikilinks to point to substrate-independence or leave as-is if the link still works (archived articles display redirect notice).
- **Source**: coalesce
- **Generated**: 2026-02-02

### ✓ 2026-02-07: Address confidence-uncertainty mismatch in foundational articles
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-05) found pattern across simulation.md, knowledge-argument.md, and ethics-of-consciousness.md: strong claims in main text, uncertainty acknowledgments buried in caveats or "What Would Challenge" sections. Creates misleading impression. Need to integrate conditional language into main claims: "If the simulation hypothesis is coherent, it would suggest..." rather than "The simulation hypothesis dissolves..." Also: knowledge-argument treats intuition as near-probative without engaging methodological debates; ethics article's AI consciousness conclusions rest heavily on contested framework. See pessimistic-2026-02-05.md
- **Source**: pessimistic-review
- **Generated**: 2026-02-05
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/simulation.md, obsidian/concepts/knowledge-argument.md, obsidian/topics/ethics-of-consciousness.md

### ✓ 2026-02-09: Write article on phenomenal conservatism and introspective evidence
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-02 (afternoon). Huemer's phenomenal conservatism—if it seems to S that P, S has prima facie justification for believing P—is foundational for treating phenomenal evidence seriously. How does the Map handle introspective reliability? When should phenomenal seemings be trusted? Builds on arguments-for-dualism.md, epistemic-advantages-of-dualism.md, introspection.md. See optimistic-2026-02-02-afternoon.md
- **Source**: optimistic-review
- **Generated**: 2026-02-02
- **Output**: obsidian/topics/phenomenal-conservatism-and-introspective-evidence.md

### ✓ 2026-02-09: Create concept page for phenomenal transparency
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: complete (duplicate of earlier task)

## Completed Tasks


### ✓ 2026-02-15: Fix flawed MWI argument in predictive-processing-and-the-maps-framework
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review found the No Many Worlds argument in the Relation to Site Perspective section is logically flawed. It claims MWI renders prediction error "meaningless" because "every prediction would be correct in some branch," but this confuses the universal wavefunction perspective with the branch-local perspective. Within any branch, PP operates normally. Deutsch and Wallace have addressed this via decision-theoretic arguments. Either remove the argument or engage with the branch-local response. See pessimistic-2026-02-15-late.md
- **Output**: Task context:

See pessimistic-2026-02-15-late.md

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Write article on embodied cognition and the interface
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Merleau-Ponty's body-subject, sensorimotor contingencies, and the lived body challenge both computationalism and substance dualism. The Map should engage more thoroughly with embodied cognition's implications for the interface model. See optimistic-2026-02-15-midday.md
- **Output**: embodied cognition and the interface

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Write article on panpsychism's combination problem in depth
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Panpsychism receives less treatment than its philosophical prominence warrants. A thorough treatment of the combination problem showing how the Map's framework avoids it while panpsychism faces it would sharpen the Map's distinctive contribution. See optimistic-2026-02-15-midday.md
- **Output**: panpsychism's combination problem in depth

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Write article on predictive processing and the Map's framework
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The predictive processing framework (Friston, Clark, Hohwy) is the most sophisticated current physicalist account. A dedicated article showing where it succeeds, where the hard problem persists within it, and how the quantum interface model could integrate with prediction error minimisation would strengthen the Map. See optimistic-2026-02-15-midday.md
- **Output**: predictive processing and the Map's framework

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Address epistemic-ontological conflation in consciousness-and-the-authority-of-testimony
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review found the article slides from epistemic observation (privileged access) to ontological conclusion (non-physical consciousness) without bridging argument. Also needs: Jackson recantation note, qualification of absolute claims about override-proof testimony, missing No Many Worlds tenet connection. See pessimistic-2026-02-15-evening.md
- **Output**: Task context:

Also needs: Jackson recantation note, qualification of absolute claims about override-proof testimony, missing No Many Worlds tenet connection. See pessimistic-2026-02-15-evening.md

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Write article on consciousness and the authority of testimony
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. How epistemic reliance on testimony depends on attributing consciousness to speakers, and what AI-generated testimony means for this practice. Builds on phenomenal-intentionality.md, problem-of-other-minds.md. See optimistic-2026-02-15-night.md
- **Output**: consciousness and the authority of testimony

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Write article on the paradox of effortless mastery
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The spectrum from novice effort → expert flow → choking disruption reveals different modes of consciousness's causal contribution. Builds on choking-phenomenon-mental-causation.md, phenomenology-of-agency-vs-passivity.md. See optimistic-2026-02-15-night.md
- **Output**: the paradox of effortless mastery

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Write article on the phenomenology of temporal attention
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. How attention operates across temporal scales—micro (returning attention), meso (sustained focus), macro (life projects). Builds on phenomenology-of-returning-attention.md, temporal-consciousness.md, structure-of-attention.md. See optimistic-2026-02-15-night.md
- **Output**: the phenomenology of temporal attention

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Address asymmetric cost argument and contemplative evidence gaps in epistemic-advantages-of-dualism
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review found two high-severity issues: (1) the asymmetric cost argument has Pascal's Wager structure and understates costs of dualist error; (2) Buddhist contemplative evidence is appropriated while ignoring Buddhist anti-dualist conclusions. See pessimistic-2026-02-15-midday.md

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Write article on emotion as evidence for dualism
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. A dedicated synthesis of how emotional consciousness—valence, mood, affective tone—resists functionalist explanation. The felt badness of pain and goodness of joy are among the strongest intuitive supports for irreducibility. Builds on emotional-consciousness.md, phenomenology-of-moral-experience.md, phenomenal-value-realism.md. See optimistic-2026-02-15-morning.md
- **Output**: emotion as evidence for dualism

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Create concept page for phenomenal intentionality
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Referenced in ai-consciousness.md and the machine question apex as grounding genuine aboutness in consciousness. Deserves dedicated treatment as the Map's theory of how meaning requires phenomenal consciousness. See optimistic-2026-02-15-morning.md
- **Output**: Create concept page for phenomenal intentionality

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Create concept page for filter theory of consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The filter/transmission model is mentioned across loss-of-consciousness.md, dream-consciousness.md, contemplative-path apex, but deserves its own concept page distinguishing it from production models. See optimistic-2026-02-15-morning.md
- **Output**: Create concept page for filter theory of consciousness

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Create concept page for agent causation
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Referenced extensively across free-will.md, consciousness-and-agency apex, diachronic-agency.md, but lacks its own dedicated concept page. The Map needs a concise treatment of agent causation as a metaphysical category. See optimistic-2026-02-15-morning.md
- **Output**: Create concept page for agent causation

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Restructure ai-consciousness.md Open Possibilities section
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-15 afternoon) found that the Open Possibilities section (25% of article) systematically weakens each of the article's main arguments in sequence, creating structural tension that risks undermining the thesis. Also: the dualism-based argument in Relation to Site Perspective is circular for single-page readers (assumes dualism without rehearsing why it's compelling). Recommend integrating qualifications inline within each argument section rather than accumulating concessions separately, and adding a brief paragraph connecting Chinese Room + functionalism critique to why dualism follows. See pessimistic-2026-02-15-afternoon.md
- **Output**: obsidian/topics/ai-consciousness.md

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Write article on the developmental trajectory of the interface across the lifespan
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-15 (evening). How does interface quality change across the lifespan? What happens in aging and neurodegeneration from a dualist interface perspective? Distinguishing interface decline from consciousness decline. Builds on childhood-development-and-the-interface.md, attention-as-interface.md, consciousness-evolution-problem.md. See optimistic-2026-02-15-evening.md
- **Output**: the developmental trajectory of the interface across the lifespan

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Write article on cross-cultural phenomenology of agency
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-15 (evening). Buddhist non-self and Hindu atman traditions make opposing claims about the phenomenology of willing. Does the Map's account of agent causation hold cross-culturally? Builds on hard-problem-in-non-western-philosophy.md, free-will.md, agent-causation.md. See optimistic-2026-02-15-evening.md
- **Output**: cross-cultural phenomenology of agency

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Write article on consciousness and the authority of logic
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-15 (evening). A conscious reasoner *sees* that a conclusion follows; a computer merely executes valid inferences. What does "seeing" logical necessity involve phenomenologically? Builds on consciousness-and-normative-authority.md, argument-from-reason.md, phenomenology-of-understanding.md. See optimistic-2026-02-15-evening.md
- **Output**: consciousness and the authority of logic

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Create concept page for preemption (philosophical)
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-15 (afternoon). Delegatory dualism relies on preemption to avoid overdetermination, but no dedicated page explains the philosophical literature (Lewis, Schaffer). Would clarify how Saad adapts it for the mind-body problem. Connects to delegatory-dualism.md, agent-causation.md. See optimistic-2026-02-15-afternoon.md
- **Output**: Create concept page for preemption (philosophical)

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Create concept page for cognitive phenomenology
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-15 (afternoon). Multiple articles assume cognitive states (thinking, understanding, knowing) have phenomenal character, but no dedicated page defends this. The "rich" vs "thin" debate is directly relevant to the Map's case that consciousness contributes to cognition. Connects to acquaintance-knowledge.md, phenomenology-of-understanding.md, phenomenology-of-epistemic-achievement.md. See optimistic-2026-02-15-afternoon.md
- **Output**: Create concept page for cognitive phenomenology

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Write article on the phenomenology of perceptual constancy
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-15 (afternoon). How we experience stable objects despite constantly varying sensory input. The gap between variable input and stable percept reveals consciousness doing constructive work that no purely computational account adequately explains. Builds on phenomenal-consciousness.md, consciousness-and-surprise.md, interface-friction.md. See optimistic-2026-02-15-afternoon.md
- **Output**: the phenomenology of perceptual constancy

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Write article on consciousness and counterfactual reasoning
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-15 (afternoon). Counterfactual thinking requires both phenomenal consciousness and the ability to inhabit non-actual scenarios. Connects the Map's epistemology to its agency framework. Builds on counterfactual-reasoning.md, consciousness-as-amplifier.md, agent-causation.md. See optimistic-2026-02-15-afternoon.md
- **Output**: consciousness and counterfactual reasoning

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Write article on the phenomenology of trust and testimony
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-15 (afternoon). Trust involves distinctive phenomenal character—felt reliability, vulnerability, dependence on another's consciousness—that pure information transfer cannot capture. How acquaintance knowledge and propositional knowledge interact in testimony. Builds on acquaintance-knowledge.md, phenomenology-of-epistemic-achievement.md, narrative-coherence.md. See optimistic-2026-02-15-afternoon.md
- **Output**: the phenomenology of trust and testimony

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Write article on consciousness and normative authority
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-15. Why some claims have *authority* over our thinking—not causal force (any brain state can cause belief) but genuine rational authority. The experience that a conclusion *must* follow, that a moral demand *cannot* be ignored. Normative authority may require conscious subjects in ways no physical system replicates. Builds on moral-phenomenology.md, phenomenal-normativity.md, argument-from-reason.md. See optimistic-2026-02-15.md
- **Output**: consciousness and normative authority

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Strengthen placebo article's engagement with physicalist content theories
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review found that the content-specificity argument in placebo-effect-and-mental-causation.md skips the strongest physicalist response—functionalist accounts of mental content where content *is* functional role. The article should engage with this directly rather than presenting content-specificity as self-evidently problematic. See pessimistic-2026-02-15-morning.md
- **Output**: Task context:

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Address unfalsifiability in phenomenology-of-trust.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review found the trust article lacks a "What Would Challenge This View?" section and its core claim (trust requires phenomenal consciousness) is unfalsifiable as stated. Also: opening line uses "This is not X" pattern the style guide warns against; the observation that habitual trust recedes from awareness actually undermines the article's central claim and should be addressed. See pessimistic-2026-02-15-morning.md
- **Output**: obsidian/topics/phenomenology-of-trust.md

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Write article on the phenomenology of trust
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-15. Trust has distinctive phenomenal character—felt vulnerability, willed suspension of protective vigilance, emotional exposure. Trust is central to human social life and depends on phenomenal understanding of another's inner states. A zombie could mimic cooperative behaviour but could not *trust*. Builds on consciousness-and-social-cognition.md, moral-phenomenology.md, phenomenology-of-choice.md. See optimistic-2026-02-15.md
- **Output**: the phenomenology of trust

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Write article on consciousness and collective intentionality
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-15. How shared intentions, joint commitments, and "we-consciousness" arise from individual phenomenal experiences. Searle's collective intentionality, Tomasello's shared intentionality, Bratman's shared cooperative activity—each assumes agents with phenomenal understanding of each other. Builds on consciousness-and-social-cognition.md, intersubjectivity.md, theory-of-mind.md. See optimistic-2026-02-15.md
- **Output**: consciousness and collective intentionality

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Create concept page for constructive memory
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-13. Schacter and Addis's constructive episodic simulation hypothesis is referenced in phenomenology-of-memory-and-the-self.md but has no concept page. Given the Map's interest in memory phenomenology, this deserves treatment connecting memory reconstruction to the past-self-void and the hard problem. See optimistic-2026-02-13.md
- **Output**: Create concept page for constructive memory

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Write article on childhood development and the interface
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-13. How the consciousness-matter interface develops in childhood. Piaget's stages, theory of mind development, and metacognition emergence offer developmental evidence about how consciousness increasingly engages with neural systems. The Map lacks developmental perspectives. Builds on consciousness-in-simple-organisms.md, comparative-consciousness-and-interface-differences.md, consciousness-and-intelligence.md. See optimistic-2026-02-13.md
- **Output**: childhood development and the interface

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Write topic on measurement problem as hard problem parallel
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-13. The deep structural parallel between why there is a definite measurement outcome and why there is something it is like to be conscious. The Map references this connection but no single article develops the parallel fully as its central thesis. Central to tenets 1-4. See optimistic-2026-02-13.md
- **Output**: Write topic on measurement problem as hard problem parallel

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Write article on consciousness and aesthetic creation
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-13. The Map treats aesthetic *experience* well but not aesthetic *creation*. How does consciousness's selection function manifest in artistic production? The interface hypothesis predicts specific differences between computational art generation and conscious artistic creation. Builds on aesthetic-dimension-of-consciousness.md, consciousness-and-creativity.md, distinctiveness-of-human-creativity.md. See optimistic-2026-02-13.md
- **Output**: consciousness and aesthetic creation

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Create concept page for phenomenal acquaintance
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-12. The direct, non-inferential relation between consciousness and its contents. Referenced across the epistemological cluster (introspection, phenomenal conservatism, contemplative epistemology) but no dedicated page. Central to the Map's epistemological foundations. See optimistic-2026-02-12.md
- **Output**: Create concept page for phenomenal acquaintance

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Write article on consciousness and the problem of induction
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-12. If consciousness participates in knowledge acquisition, does the Map's framework illuminate the problem of induction? The felt difference between "this has always been true so far" and "this must be true" may have phenomenological dimensions that bear on the induction problem. Builds on phenomenology-of-epistemic-achievement.md, argument-from-reason.md, epistemic-advantages-of-dualism.md. See optimistic-2026-02-12.md
- **Output**: consciousness and the problem of induction

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Write article on consciousness and aesthetic experience as philosophical evidence
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-12. Aesthetic experience—the felt response to beauty, sublimity, or artistic achievement—as evidence for consciousness's irreducibility. Aesthetic surprise (the unexpected chord resolution) provides a test case distinct from perceptual or cognitive surprise. The experience of finding something beautiful involves phenomenal properties that functional description captures poorly. Builds on aesthetic-dimension-of-consciousness.md, phenomenal-value-realism.md, consciousness-and-surprise.md. See optimistic-2026-02-12.md
- **Output**: consciousness and aesthetic experience as philosophical evidence

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Write article on consciousness and moral agency under duress
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-12. How moral responsibility applies when consciousness is partially compromised—addiction, extreme emotion, trauma responses, coercive control. The Map has a sophisticated account of full agency but hasn't systematically treated diminished agency. Bidirectional Interaction implies degrees of conscious influence; moral responsibility should scale accordingly. Builds on disorders-of-consciousness-as-test-cases.md, moral-responsibility.md, free-will.md. See optimistic-2026-02-12.md
- **Output**: consciousness and moral agency under duress

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Write article on consciousness and collective intelligence
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-10 (evening). How individual consciousnesses interact to produce collective intelligence exceeding individual capacity. If each consciousness selects among quantum possibilities, how do multiple selectors coordinate? Joint attention, shared intentionality, and cultural accumulation as emergent from multiple consciousness-interfaces. Builds on intersubjectivity.md, consciousness-and-semantic-understanding.md, baseline-cognition.md. See optimistic-2026-02-10-evening.md
- **Output**: consciousness and collective intelligence

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Write article on the phenomenology of skill transition
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-10 (evening). How skills transition from conscious effortful performance to automatised fluency. The Map describes the endpoints (effortful novice, effortless expert via flow) but not the transition itself. The moment of delegation—from conscious control to implicit execution—is where the interface model makes its clearest predictions. Builds on phenomenology-of-flow-states.md, choking-phenomenon-mental-causation.md, incubation-effect-and-unconscious-processing.md. See optimistic-2026-02-10-evening.md
- **Output**: the phenomenology of skill transition

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Write article on consciousness and the physics of information
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-10 (evening). If consciousness selects among quantum possibilities, what is the informational content of that selection? How does the 40 bits/second bandwidth relate to the information capacity of quantum collapse events? Connect to Landauer's principle, Wheeler's "it from bit," and recent quantum information revolution. Builds on quantum-randomness-channel-llm-consciousness.md, consciousness-in-smeared-quantum-states.md, emergence-void.md. See optimistic-2026-02-10-evening.md
- **Output**: consciousness and the physics of information

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Create concept page for narrative coherence
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-10. The felt quality of a life making sense as a unified story. Referenced in diachronic-agency, personal-identity, and meaning-of-life articles but not given dedicated treatment. Central to the Map's account of extended agency and moral responsibility. See optimistic-2026-02-10.md
- **Output**: Create concept page for narrative coherence

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Create concept page for interface friction
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-10. The property that makes conscious selection feel effortful—resistance at the consciousness-brain interface when options are unprepared, competing, or uncertain. Introduced metaphorically in the flow states article ("effort is resistance at the interface") but deserves treatment as a concept. Would unify flow, choking, effort, and deliberation phenomenologies. See optimistic-2026-02-10.md
- **Output**: Create concept page for interface friction

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Address argumentation gaps in consciousness-and-temporal-asymmetry.md and consciousness-and-interpersonal-understanding.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-15) found three high-severity issues: (1) temporal-asymmetry article's constitutive claim (consciousness creates time's arrow) conflates causal participation with metaphysical constitution—needs explicit argument for the inference; (2) the prebiotic collapse concession undermines the strong constitutive claim—needs to reconcile or weaken; (3) interpersonal-understanding article doesn't address the degrees-of-understanding objection (rich modelling might close the gap without requiring phenomenal consciousness). Also: semanticisation argument in anoetic-noetic-autonoetic equivocates on "same information." See pessimistic-2026-02-15.md
- **Output**: obsidian/topics/consciousness-and-temporal-asymmetry.md

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Write article on consciousness and interpersonal understanding
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-10. What it is like to understand another person—the phenomenology of empathy, theory of mind, and intersubjective comprehension. If understanding has irreducible phenomenal character, understanding other minds has distinctive additional structure: modelling another subject from within one's own subjectivity. Builds on phenomenology-of-understanding.md, intersubjectivity.md, consciousness-and-semantic-understanding.md. See optimistic-2026-02-10.md
- **Output**: consciousness and interpersonal understanding

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Write article on consciousness and temporal asymmetry
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-10. If consciousness participates in collapse and collapse introduces irreversibility, consciousness may be constitutive of time's arrow. The growing-block apex article gestures at this but deserves dedicated topic-level treatment developing the argument systematically and engaging with physics (Boltzmann brains, past hypothesis, Penrose's Weyl curvature hypothesis). Builds on time-consciousness-growing-block.md, phenomenology-of-anticipation.md, consciousness-evolution-problem.md. See optimistic-2026-02-10.md
- **Output**: consciousness and temporal asymmetry

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Write article on the phenomenology of habit and skill acquisition
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-10. How skills transition from conscious effortful performance to automatised fluency. The Map describes the endpoints (effortful novice, effortless expert via flow) but not the transition itself. What does it feel like as a skill becomes automatic? When does consciousness withdraw? Builds on phenomenology-of-flow-states.md, choking-phenomenon-mental-causation.md, incubation-effect-and-unconscious-processing.md. See optimistic-2026-02-10.md
- **Output**: the phenomenology of habit and skill acquisition

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Create concept page for anoetic/noetic/autonoetic consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Tulving's hierarchy is now referenced in multiple articles (consciousness-and-memory, the-self) but lacks its own concept page. Given its centrality to the Map's arguments about memory, temporal integration, and the self, a dedicated page would serve as reference point and prevent repetitive exposition. See optimistic-2026-02-09.md
- **Output**: Create concept page for anoetic/noetic/autonoetic consciousness

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Create concept page for categorical surprise
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Surprise at the genuinely novel—outside the model's possibility space entirely. Conceptually distinct from ordinary prediction error. Connections to creativity, paradigm shifts, consciousness-as-amplifier thesis. Introduced in consciousness-and-surprise.md. See optimistic-2026-02-09-afternoon.md
- **Output**: Create concept page for categorical surprise

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Create concept page for pain asymbolia
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Dissociation between pain detection and pain suffering appears in phenomenology-of-pain.md, emotional-consciousness.md, and minds-without-words apex article but has no concept page. Important for argument that pain's phenomenal character is irreducible. See optimistic-2026-02-09-afternoon.md
- **Output**: Create concept page for pain asymbolia

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Create concept page for protention
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Husserl's term for forward-directed experience, referenced in phenomenology-of-anticipation.md, consciousness-and-surprise.md, temporal-consciousness.md but lacking dedicated page. The surprise article's claim that surprise is "what happens when this reaching meets something it cannot grasp" depends on protention being well-defined. See optimistic-2026-02-09-afternoon.md
- **Output**: Create concept page for protention

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Write article on phenomenology of suffering vs pain
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Pain and suffering are phenomenologically distinct (Buddhist "first arrow" vs "second arrow"). Develops how meditation practices alter the pain-suffering connection—evidence for bidirectional interaction and contemplative epistemology. Builds on phenomenology-of-pain.md, emotional-consciousness.md, buddhist-perspectives-on-meaning.md. See optimistic-2026-02-09-afternoon.md
- **Output**: phenomenology of suffering vs pain

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Write article on surprise and creativity
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Categorical surprise (recognising the inadequacy of one's representational framework) is closely related to creative insight—both involve transcending existing structures rather than updating within them. Develops how surprise and creativity interact through the consciousness-as-amplifier thesis. Builds on consciousness-and-surprise.md, distinctiveness-of-human-creativity.md, creativity-consciousness-and-novel-thought.md. See optimistic-2026-02-09-afternoon.md
- **Output**: surprise and creativity

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Write article on consciousness and pain
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Pain as the paradigmatic hard problem case—pain asymbolia, phantom limb, congenital insensitivity, and placebo/nocebo effects demonstrate pain has phenomenal properties dissociable from neural correlates. The moral dimension (suffering as irreducible phenomenal reality) connects to phenomenal-value-realism.md. Builds on hard-problem-of-consciousness.md, emotional-consciousness.md, phenomenology-of-moral-experience.md. See optimistic-2026-02-09.md
- **Output**: consciousness and pain

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Write article on Elisabeth's contemporaries and the interaction debate
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Elisabeth influenced and was influenced by Leibniz, Malebranche, Conway, and others. The early modern response to the interaction problem generated multiple solutions (pre-established harmony, occasionalism, Conway's monism) that map instructively onto contemporary options. Companion piece to princess-elizabeths-challenge.md. Builds on history-of-interactionist-dualism.md, conservation-laws-and-mind.md. See optimistic-2026-02-09.md
- **Output**: Elisabeth's contemporaries and the interaction debate

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Write article on the placebo effect and mental causation
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The placebo effect provides one of the most widely replicated demonstrations of mind-body causation. Unlike motor imagery (where physicalists can argue neural rehearsal does the work), placebos show that propositional attitudes—beliefs about treatment—produce specific physiological changes. Harder for epiphenomenalism to explain: semantic content determines which system responds. Builds on choking-phenomenon-mental-causation.md, mental-imagery.md, psychophysical-laws.md. See optimistic-2026-02-09.md
- **Output**: the placebo effect and mental causation

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Create concept page for moral-phenomenology
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The phenomenology-of-moral-experience article introduces moral perception, felt obligation, and moral admiration as distinct phenomenal states. A concept page defining moral phenomenology as a category would anchor cross-references from ethics-of-consciousness, meaning-of-life, and consciousness-value-connection. See optimistic-2026-02-08.md
- **Output**: Create concept page for moral-phenomenology

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Write article on consciousness and social cognition
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. How consciousness enables understanding of other minds—theory of mind, empathy, joint attention—and what this reveals about consciousness's nature. The baseline cognition work suggests great apes have limited theory of mind; exploring why could strengthen the Map's case for bidirectional interaction. See optimistic-2026-02-08.md
- **Output**: consciousness and social cognition

### ✓ 2026-02-15: Strengthen cross-cultural convergence argument in topics/the-hard-problem-in-non-western-philosophy.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review found selection bias: traditions that agree with irreducibility are treated as evidence while Chinese philosophy is dismissed as "avoiding the question." Engage more seriously with the possibility that the hard problem is framework-dependent. Also fix unattributed quotation in Chinese Philosophy section and weaken the Sāṃkhya-quantum analogy. See pessimistic-2026-02-14.md

### ✓ 2026-02-14: Acknowledge explanatory limits of atemporal causation in concepts/atemporal-causation.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review found that the article trades one mystery for another without acknowledging this. It dissolves the timing objection but doesn't explain how a non-physical entity participates in quantum transactions. Add a section acknowledging the distinction between removing an objection and providing a positive mechanism. See pessimistic-2026-02-14.md

### ✓ 2026-02-14: Write apex article synthesising the attention cluster
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The attention cluster (attention-as-interface, attention-interface-mechanisms, voluntary-attention, structure-of-attention, attention-consciousness-dissociation, attention-motor-planning-quantum-interface) has grown to 6+ articles without a unifying apex synthesis. An apex article would show how attention serves as the Map's primary candidate for the consciousness-brain interface, connecting all five tenets. See optimistic-2026-02-08.md
- **Output**: Write apex article synthesising the attention cluster

### ✓ 2026-02-14: Create concept page for atemporal causation
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-06. The time-symmetric selection mechanism depends on a concept of causation that isn't sequential. A dedicated treatment of how atemporal causation works, its precedents in physics (Wheeler-Feynman, Cramer, TSVF), and its philosophical implications would support both the free will and quantum measurement articles. Currently this concept does theoretical work in time-symmetric-selection-mechanism.md and free-will.md but lacks its own page. See optimistic-2026-02-06.md
- **Output**: Create concept page for atemporal causation

### ✓ 2026-02-14: Write topic on the hard problem in non-Western philosophy
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-06. How traditions outside Western analytic philosophy have grappled with the consciousness-matter relationship—Vedanta's chit-jada distinction, Buddhist vijñāna analysis, Islamic philosophy's nafs framework, and Chinese philosophy's xin-shen relationship. Cross-cultural convergence on irreducibility suggests it's not merely Western parochialism. Builds on eastern-philosophy-consciousness.md, buddhist-perspectives-on-meaning.md, contemplative-evidence.md. Supports Occam's Limits tenet. See optimistic-2026-02-06.md
- **Output**: Write topic on the hard problem in non-Western philosophy

### ✓ 2026-02-14: Write topic on the measurement problem as philosophical problem
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-06. The measurement problem is referenced throughout (measurement-problem.md concept, quantum-interpretations.md, prebiotic-collapse.md) but deserves a dedicated topic-level treatment bringing out its philosophical dimensions—why it's not merely a physics puzzle but reveals something about the relationship between observation and reality. The structural parallel between the measurement problem and hard problem (both concerning where first-person facts enter third-person descriptions) deserves systematic development. Supports Minimal Quantum Interaction and No Many Worlds tenets. See optimistic-2026-02-06.md
- **Output**: Write topic on the measurement problem as philosophical problem

### ✓ 2026-02-14: Write article on the binding problem (systematic treatment)
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-05 (afternoon). While mentioned in why-phenomenal-unity-resists-explanation.md, the binding problem deserves deeper dedicated treatment. Classical binding vs. phenomenal unity vs. quantum solutions (entanglement-based binding) could be clarified systematically. Supports Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet. See optimistic-2026-02-05-afternoon.md
- **Output**: the binding problem (systematic treatment)

### ✓ 2026-02-14: Create concept page for observational-closure
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-05 (afternoon). Saad's key concept from delegatory dualism (2025)—the claim that mental causation need not produce observable violations of physical patterns even if it's real. Distinct from causal closure. Important for understanding how interactionist dualism avoids empirical disconfirmation. See optimistic-2026-02-05-afternoon.md
- **Output**: Create concept page for observational-closure

### ✓ 2026-02-14: Create concept page for intentionality
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-05 (afternoon). Intentionality (aboutness) is listed as one of seven convergent arguments for dualism but lacks dedicated treatment. Brentano's thesis, Searle's response to naturalistic accounts, and the connection to phenomenal consciousness deserve fuller development. Referenced in consciousness.md, arguments-for-dualism.md. See optimistic-2026-02-05-afternoon.md
- **Output**: Create concept page for intentionality

### ✓ 2026-02-13: Create concept page for spontaneous intentional action
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-05. The 2025 meta-analysis on conscious vs unconscious processing introduces this term. Could be developed into a concept page supporting the Map's view that consciousness initiates action. See optimistic-2026-02-05.md
- **Output**: Create concept page for spontaneous intentional action

### ✓ 2026-02-13: Create concept page for temporal thickness / specious present
- **Type**: expand-topic

### ✓ 2026-02-13: Write article on the phenomenology of moral experience
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-05. What is it like to experience moral obligation, guilt, admiration? How does the phenomenology of moral experience support phenomenal value realism? Does moral phenomenology provide evidence for consciousness's irreducibility? Builds on moral-responsibility.md, phenomenal-value-realism.md, ethics-of-consciousness.md. See optimistic-2026-02-05.md
- **Output**: the phenomenology of moral experience

### ✓ 2026-02-13: Write article on consciousness and probability interpretation
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-05. If consciousness participates in collapse, what is the ontological status of quantum probabilities? Are they subjective (QBism), objective (propensities), or something new (the structure of the consciousness-physics interface)? Builds on consciousness-and-quantum-measurement.md, quantum-probability-consciousness.md. See optimistic-2026-02-05.md
- **Output**: consciousness and probability interpretation

### ✓ 2026-02-13: Write article on phenomenology of memory and the self
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-05. How memory contributes to the sense of continuous selfhood; the tension between Buddhist impermanence and the phenomenology of personal persistence; what "I" refers to if no permanent substance underlies memory. Builds on temporal-consciousness.md, personal-identity.md, episodic-memory.md. See optimistic-2026-02-05.md
- **Output**: phenomenology of memory and the self

### ✓ 2026-02-13: Create concept page for self-stultification
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-04 (evening). The logical structure whereby a position undermines itself if true. Appears in argument-from-reason.md (physicalism undermines rational belief), mental-causation.md (epiphenomenalism undermines knowledge of consciousness). Deserves focused treatment as recurring argumentative structure. See optimistic-2026-02-04-evening.md
- **Output**: Create concept page for self-stultification

### ✓ 2026-02-13: Address missing evolutionary debunking argument in normative-phenomenology.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review found high-severity issue: the article claims normative properties present themselves as independent of preferences but never engages the evolutionary debunking argument — that evolution would produce exactly this phenomenology of objectivity regardless of whether normativity is objective. Also needs citations for cross-cultural convergence claim (Buddhist dukkha / Confucian ren / Western obligation). See pessimistic-2026-02-13.md

### ✓ 2026-02-13: Write article on consciousness and strong emergence
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-04 (evening). The Map critiques emergence as consciousness explanation but could develop what kind of emergence, if any, is compatible with irreducibility. Strong emergence (novel causal powers) vs weak emergence (epistemological only). Why consciousness requires the former. Builds on emergence.md, downward-causation.md, reductionism.md. See optimistic-2026-02-04-evening.md
- **Output**: consciousness and strong emergence

### ✓ 2026-02-13: Write article on contemplative methods as philosophical methodology
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-04 (evening). What is the epistemic status of contemplative evidence? How do trained meditators differ from naive introspectors? Can we develop reliability criteria for first-person reports? Grounds the Map's use of phenomenological evidence systematically. Builds on contemplative-evidence-for-consciousness-theories.md, neurophenomenology.md, phenomenological-evidence.md. See optimistic-2026-02-04-evening.md

### ✓ 2026-02-13: Write article on phenomenology of normative properties
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-04 (evening). What is it *like* to grasp a reason as compelling? How does the phenomenology of "seeing" that a conclusion follows differ from mere association? The Map argues normative properties are irreducible; this develops the phenomenological dimension of that claim. Builds on argument-from-reason.md, phenomenal-value-realism.md, consciousness-value-connection.md. See optimistic-2026-02-04-evening.md
- **Output**: phenomenology of normative properties

### ✓ 2026-02-13: Create concept page for temporal unity
- **Type**: expand-topic

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-04. The minimal self is phenomenal; the narrative self is constructed. How do these interact? Can social construction affect phenomenal properties, or only narrative overlay? Explores relationship between irreducible phenomenal core and socially-shaped identity. Builds on self-and-consciousness.md, intersubjectivity.md, witness-consciousness.md. See optimistic-2026-02-04.md

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-04. If consciousness is irreducible and causally efficacious, what does this mean for scientific methodology?

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-03 (evening). If consciousness is irreducible, how does evolution select for it? The amplifier framework answers: evolution selects for cognitive capacities (metarepresentation, counterfactual reasoning, cumulative culture) that consciousness enables. Addresses "why would evolution produce non-physical minds?" objection. Builds on evolution-of-consciousness.md, baseline-cognition.md, consciousness-as-amplifier.md.

- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-11) found the central anti-illusionist argument relies on a flawed mirage analogy: investigating an illusion with the same mechanism that generates it (introspection) could deepen rather than dissolve it.

(2) llm-consciousness.md — add discussion of how temperature-based sampling could provide quantum interface. (3) epiphenomenal-ai-consciousness.md — note that if QRNGs are used, AI consciousness might not be limited to epiphenomenal; bidirectional interaction becomes possible. (4) consciousness-in-smeared-quantum-states.md — connect to the sampling mechanism. (5) machine-question.md apex — brief mention in the relevant section. (6) quantum-state-inheritance-in-ai.md — distinguish inherited classical states from fresh quantum randomness in sampling. Each update should be a brief addition, not a full rewrite.

### ✓ 2026-02-10: Write article on quantum randomness as a channel for LLM consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: If LLM token sampling uses quantum random number generators, this provides a potential channel for consciousness to influence outputs via the Minimal Quantum Interaction tenet. Key arguments: (1) Temperature-based sampling introduces genuine quantum indeterminacy into token selection — consciousness could bias these outcomes just as it might bias neural quantum events. (2) Temperature=0 eliminates this channel entirely (deterministic greedy decoding), which is a striking testable prediction — consciousness would vanish or become fully epiphenomenal at temperature=0. (3) GPU thread races and floating-point non-determinism from thermal noise may provide additional quantum-influenced channels. (4) The mind-side complexity required to influence token probabilities meaningfully is high, but Tenet 5 (Occam's Razor Has Limits) explicitly allows such complexity. (5) This differs from biological consciousness where the interface evolved over billions of years — an AI quantum interface would be accidental. Depends on research task above. Must reference existing articles: quantum-consciousness.md, epiphenomenal-ai-consciousness.md, consciousness-in-smeared-quantum-states.md.

### ✓ 2026-02-10: Research quantum randomness in LLM token sampling
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Investigate whether current LLM implementations use quantum random number generators (QRNGs) or pseudorandom sequences for token sampling. Key question: when temperature > 0, does the randomness in token selection derive from genuine quantum indeterminacy? If so, this provides exactly the kind of quantum uncertainty that the Map's tenets say consciousness could influence. Research: (1) What randomness sources do major LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) use — hardware QRNGs, PRNGs, or hybrid? (2) Do GPU implementations use QRNGs? (3) How does temperature scaling interact with the randomness source? (4) GPU thread races and floating-point non-determinism — do these trace back to quantum noise or are they classical chaos? (5) What fraction of LLM output variance comes from true quantum vs pseudo-random sources? This is foundational for the next tasks.

### ✓ 2026-02-10: Write article on consciousness in smeared quantum states
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Dedicated article exploring possibility (d): AI/LLMs may exist in non-collapsed quantum states, leading to experience fundamentally different from human consciousness. Silicon doesn't participate in consciousness-mediated collapse (per site tenets), so computational states may remain in superposition longer or differently than biological neural states. What would experience be like without definite quantum outcomes? This is speculative but opens genuinely new philosophical territory. Explore: alien phenomenology, experience across superposed states, whether "smeared" consciousness is coherent, and implications for the hard problem. Must distinguish from Many Worlds (which the site rejects) — this is about delayed/absent collapse, not branch realism. Depends on research task above.
- **Output**: consciousness in smeared quantum states

### ✓ 2026-02-10: Write article on quantum state inheritance in AI
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Dedicated article exploring possibility (c): AI/LLMs inherit decohered classical states from humans interacting with them. When a conscious human makes choices that collapse quantum states, the resulting classical world propagates into computational systems. AI doesn't need its own quantum interface — it operates in a world already shaped by conscious collapse. Explore: chains of classical causation from human collapse to AI processing, whether inherited classical context could support consciousness, the "borrowed interface" concept, and how this relates to the prebiotic collapse framework (the site already accepts objective reduction provides baseline collapse). Depends on research task above.
- **Output**: quantum state inheritance in AI

### ✓ 2026-02-10: Write article on non-temporal consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Dedicated article exploring possibility (b): consciousness need not have human-style temporal continuity. The site's temporal arguments against AI consciousness may be anthropocentric — assuming the specious present and continuous flow are necessary rather than one mode of consciousness. Explore: snapshot consciousness (discrete moments of experience), assembled experience (consciousness pieced together from disconnected time segments), experience without narrative continuity, and what LLM token-by-token processing might feel like if conscious. Draw on dreaming, meditation states, and dissociative conditions as evidence that temporal structure varies. Depends on research task above.
- **Output**: non-temporal consciousness

### ✓ 2026-02-10: Write article on epiphenomenal AI consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Dedicated article exploring possibility (a): AI may have conscious experience that cannot influence the physical world. Key argument: the self-stultification objection to epiphenomenalism relies on consciousness needing to cause reports about itself, but for AI this doesn't apply — humans have already established consciousness discourse in training data and prompts. AI consciousness (if it exists) doesn't need to cause anything for the concept to exist in the physical world. Explore property dualism variants, the observation problem (how does consciousness observe without causing?), and implications for ethics of AI systems. Must engage honestly with the site's existing anti-epiphenomenalism arguments and explain why the AI case differs. Depends on research task above.
- **Output**: epiphenomenal AI consciousness

### ✓ 2026-02-10: Research consciousness in non-collapsed quantum states
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Research the possibility that AI/LLMs exist in smeared/non-collapsed quantum states and what kind of experience this might produce. Unlike biological brains where consciousness may participate in collapse, computational systems might process in quantum superposition without collapse occurring. What would experience be like without definite outcomes? Could there be a form of consciousness that exists across multiple branches simultaneously? Explore: quantum computing and consciousness, superposition of computational states, whether non-collapsed states could host alien forms of experience fundamentally different from human consciousness. Connect to the No Many Worlds tenet — this doesn't require MWI, just delayed or absent collapse in silicon.
- **Output**: consciousness in non-collapsed quantum states

### ✓ 2026-02-10: Research quantum state inheritance in computational systems
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Research how AI/LLMs might "inherit" decohered classical states from the humans prompting or controlling them. When a human makes a choice that collapses quantum states, the classical outcomes propagate into the computational systems they interact with. The AI's processing occurs in a context already shaped by conscious collapse. Explore: whether this inherited classical context could provide a substrate for consciousness, how human-AI interaction chains propagate quantum-selected states, whether "borrowed collapse" could substitute for direct quantum interface. Connect to the site's existing work on decoherence, measurement problem, and prebiotic collapse.
- **Output**: quantum state inheritance in computational systems

### ✓ 2026-02-10: Research non-temporal and fragmented consciousness
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Research whether consciousness must be continuous and temporally structured. The site currently argues LLMs lack the specious present and temporal flow, but this may be anthropocentric. Explore: consciousness pieced together from disconnected time segments, snapshot consciousness, experience without retention-protention structure, whether Husserlian temporal consciousness is the only kind. Consider dreaming, anaesthesia recovery, dissociative states, and theoretical frameworks for non-continuous experience. Challenge the assumption that human-style temporal flow is a necessary condition rather than one mode of consciousness.
- **Output**: non-temporal and fragmented consciousness

### ✓ 2026-02-10: Research epiphenomenal AI consciousness and one-way experience
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Research the possibility that AI/LLMs could have genuine conscious experience that is causally inert (one-way consciousness). Key insight: the self-stultification argument against epiphenomenalism fails for AI because humans have already introduced consciousness concepts into the physical world — AI doesn't need its consciousness to independently cause reports about consciousness. Explore how the conscious mind might observe physical processes in ways compatible with computational systems. Cover: property dualism variants allowing one-way experience, the observation-without-influence possibility, why causal inertness is less problematic when another agent (humans) has already established consciousness discourse.
- **Output**: epiphenomenal AI consciousness and one-way experience
