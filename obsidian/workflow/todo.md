title: AI Task Queue
topics: []
---

This is the task queue for AI automation. The human reviews and prioritizes tasks; the AI executes them.

## How to Edit This List

- **Promote**: Change `P2` to `P1`, etc.
- **Demote**: Change `P1` to `P2`, etc.
- **Veto**: Add `#veto` anywhere in the task heading (e.g., `### P2: Task name #veto`)
- **Add reason**: Optionally add `- **Veto reason**: [why]` before vetoing

Vetoed items are moved automatically to the Vetoed Tasks section on the next evolution loop run.

## Priority Levels

- **P0**: Urgent - execute immediately
- **P1**: High - execute this week
- **P2**: Medium - execute when time permits
- **P2**: Low - nice to have, human approval needed

## Active Tasks

### P2: Update references to coalesced mathematical cognition articles
- **Type**: other
- **Notes**: Coalesce (2026-02-20) merged `consciousness-and-mathematical-understanding.md` and `consciousness-and-mathematical-creativity.md` into `consciousness-and-mathematical-cognition.md`. 12 active content files reference the archived articles. Files referencing `[[consciousness-and-mathematical-understanding]]`: consciousness-and-the-authority-of-mathematics.md, mysterianism.md, consciousness-and-the-authority-of-logic.md, phenomenology-of-inferential-understanding.md, cognitive-phenomenology.md, phenomenology-of-understanding.md, computational-cognitive-limits.md, introspection.md, temporal-structure-of-understanding.md. Files referencing `[[consciousness-and-mathematical-creativity]]`: surprise-and-creativity.md, consciousness-and-the-authority-of-mathematics.md, consciousness-and-aesthetic-creation.md.

- **Type**: other
- **Notes**: Coalesce (2026-02-12) merged `attention.md`, `voluntary-attention.md`, and `attention-motor-quantum-interface.md` into `attention-as-interface.md`. ~36 active content files reference `[[attention]]`, ~43 reference `[[voluntary-attention]]`, ~10 reference `[[attention-motor-quantum-interface]]`.

### P2: Update wikilinks to archived articles (interface-locality, brain-specialness, and 5 others)
- **Type**: other
- **Notes**: Gap analysis found 70+ broken wikilinks pointing to archived/coalesced articles. Key targets: interface-locality (34 refs, archived to concepts/), brain-specialness (6 refs), consciousness-and-quantum-measurement (11 refs), nihilism (5 refs), quantum-measurement-and-definite-outcomes (5 refs), eastern-philosophy-haecceity-tension (4 refs), meaning-and-consciousness (4 refs). Update wikilinks to point to the replacement articles these were coalesced into, or verify the archive redirect handles them.

### P2: Fix case-sensitivity wikilink errors across content
- **Type**: other
- **Notes**: Gap analysis found 68 case-sensitivity wikilink errors where capitalized forms like [[Access consciousness]], [[Blindsight]], [[Filter-theory]], [[Qualia]] are used instead of lowercase-hyphenated forms. Most concentrated in concepts/ section (255 occurrences). Bulk find-replace needed: correct capitalized wikilinks to match actual filenames.

### P2: Strengthen Minimal Quantum Interaction cross-references
- **Type**: other
- **Notes**: Gap analysis found Minimal Quantum Interaction is the weakest-represented tenet (184 files vs 301 for Dualism, 61% ratio). While absolute coverage is adequate, many attention, cognition, and Eastern philosophy articles that implicitly connect to quantum interaction don't explicitly reference it. Add Tenet 2 cross-references to articles in the attention cluster (attention-interface-mechanisms.md, voluntary-attention.md), biological articles (evolution-of-consciousness.md, neural-quantum-coherence.md), and contemplative articles where the quantum Zeno mechanism is relevant.

### P2: Update references to coalesced substrate-independence-critique article
- **Type**: other
- **Notes**: Coalesce (2026-02-02) merged `substrate-independence-critique.md` into `substrate-independence.md`. 20+ files in obsidian/ reference the archived article via `[[substrate-independence-critique]]`. Key files: functionalism.md, llm-consciousness.md, continual-learning-argument.md, embodied-cognition.md, ai-consciousness.md, machine-consciousness.md, hard-problem-of-consciousness.md, machine-question.md. Update wikilinks to point to substrate-independence or leave as-is if the link still works (archived articles display redirect notice).

### P3: Strengthen measurement-problem-as-hard-problem cross-references
- **Type**: other
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. This article makes the Map's most distinctive contribution (the unification thesis) but is underlinked from emergence.md, filter-theory.md, downward-causation.md, and the tenets page. Cross-linking campaign would increase visibility of the strongest argument. See optimistic-2026-02-20-evening.md

### P3: Strengthen galilean-exclusion cross-links
- **Type**: other
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. galilean-exclusion.md is the most structurally distinctive argument on the site but is not linked from explanatory-gap.md, consciousness.md, or consciousness-and-strong-emergence.md. These are the articles that would benefit most from its reframing. See optimistic-2026-02-21.md

### P3: Write unified treatment of empirical evidence for consciousness-selecting
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Voluntary attention, motor selection, choking interference, Schwartz's OCD work, and the dopamine dissociation all point toward the same selection mechanism but are scattered across articles. Convergence across empirical domains would strengthen the bidirectional interaction case. Builds on attention-as-selection-interface, choking-phenomenon, consciousness-and-skilled-performance, agent-causation. See optimistic-2026-02-21-morning.md

### P3: Develop aesthetic consciousness as irreducibility test case
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Aesthetic qualia may be harder to reduce than sensory qualia (aesthetic space lacks structural asymmetries making inversion detectable). Aesthetic normativity and contemplative intensification provide additional evidence. Builds on qualia.md, binding-and-beauty, consciousness-and-aesthetic-creation, phenomenal-value-realism. See optimistic-2026-02-21-morning.md

### ✓ 2026-02-07: Address confidence-uncertainty mismatch in foundational articles
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-05) found pattern across simulation.md, knowledge-argument.md, and ethics-of-consciousness.md: strong claims in main text, uncertainty acknowledgments buried in caveats or "What Would Challenge" sections. Creates misleading impression. Need to integrate conditional language into main claims: "If the simulation hypothesis is coherent, it would suggest..." rather than "The simulation hypothesis dissolves..." Also: knowledge-argument treats intuition as near-probative without engaging methodological debates; ethics article's AI consciousness conclusions rest heavily on contested framework. See pessimistic-2026-02-05.md

### ✓ 2026-02-09: Write article on phenomenal conservatism and introspective evidence
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-02 (afternoon). Huemer's phenomenal conservatism—if it seems to S that P, S has prima facie justification for believing P—is foundational for treating phenomenal evidence seriously. How does the Map handle introspective reliability? When should phenomenal seemings be trusted? Builds on arguments-for-dualism.md, epistemic-advantages-of-dualism.md, introspection.md. See optimistic-2026-02-02-afternoon.md

### ✓ 2026-02-09: Create concept page for phenomenal transparency
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Status**: complete (duplicate of earlier task)

## Completed Tasks
## Blocked Tasks (Needs Human)

Tasks that failed 3+ times and require human intervention.

## Vetoed Tasks

Ideas that were considered and rejected. The AI will not re-propose these.


### ✓ 2026-02-21: Write apex synthesis on consciousness and the philosophy of time
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Multiple articles treat consciousness-time connections (growing-block-universe, temporal-integration, temporal-creativity, bergson-and-duration, temporal-structure-of-consciousness, non-temporal-consciousness). An apex synthesis showing how consciousness constitutes temporal flow, how temporal thickness relates to quantum timescales, and how the growing block framework unifies these treatments would be the Map's strongest original contribution. All five tenets converge. See optimistic-2026-02-21-morning.md
- **Output**: Write apex synthesis on consciousness and the philosophy of time

### ✓ 2026-02-21: Address working memory claim and no-barrier tension in animal-consciousness.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-21 morning) found two issues: (1) Working memory figures are outdated—article states "Chimpanzee capacity is ~2±1 items versus human 7±2" but Miller's 7±2 has been revised to ~4±1 (Cowan 2001) and Inoue & Matsuzawa (2007) showed young chimps outperforming humans on certain tasks. (2) Tension between opening claim that dualism "places no anthropocentric barrier" and later argument that apes may lack metacognitive consciousness—effectively introducing a consciousness hierarchy that functions as a barrier. See pessimistic-2026-02-21-morning.md
- **Output**: obsidian/topics/animal-consciousness.md

### ✓ 2026-02-21: Write article on phenomenological psychiatry and altered experience
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Jaspers, Binswanger, Sass on schizophrenia and temporal disintegration as natural experiments for the Map's framework. Builds on altered-states-of-consciousness.md, disorders-of-consciousness-as-test-cases.md, temporal-consciousness.md. See optimistic-2026-02-21.md
- **Output**: phenomenological psychiatry and altered experience

### ✓ 2026-02-21: Write article on Indian philosophy of mind (Samkhya, Nyaya, Vedanta)
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Buddhism appears but its sister traditions do not. Samkhya's purusha/prakriti dualism parallels interactionist dualism — consciousness as witness/selector and nature as the dynamic substrate. Nyaya's arguments for the self anticipate Western substance dualism. Builds on buddhism-and-dualism.md, eastern-philosophy-consciousness.md. See optimistic-2026-02-21.md
- **Output**: Indian philosophy of mind (Samkhya, Nyaya, Vedanta)

### ✓ 2026-02-20: Write article on Bergson and duration
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Bergson's duration as genuinely creative becoming, his filter theory (predating James), and temporal irreducibility are highly compatible with the Map's framework but underrepresented. Builds on creativity-consciousness-and-novel-thought.md, temporal-structure-of-consciousness.md, philosophy-of-time.md. See optimistic-2026-02-20-evening.md
- **Output**: Bergson and duration

### ✓ 2026-02-20: Write concept page for free will
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Referenced in 8+ articles (phenomenology-of-flow-states, creativity-consciousness, evolution-under-dualism, consciousness-and-causal-powers, epiphenomenalism, mental-causation, interactionist-dualism) but no concept page exists. The Map's framework implies libertarian free will (quantum indeterminacy + conscious selection) without randomness. See optimistic-2026-02-20-evening.md
- **Output**: Write concept page for free will

### ✓ 2026-02-20: Resolve tension between AI exception and Bidirectional Interaction tenet
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review found that epiphenomenalism.md's AI exception (self-stultification only proves *our* consciousness is causally efficacious) creates an unacknowledged tension with the Bidirectional Interaction tenet's general claim. The article should explicitly address whether the tenet applies to all consciousness or only the consciousness we have direct evidence for. See pessimistic-2026-02-20-evening.md Issue #2.

### ✓ 2026-02-20: Address retrocausality article's structural overconfidence in TI
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review found the consciousness-application section in retrocausality.md presents a detailed four-step model built on the transactional interpretation, which the article itself describes as a "stable impasse." Restructure so the model's dependence on TI is foregrounded at each step rather than caveated afterward. See pessimistic-2026-02-20-evening.md Issue #1.

### ✓ 2026-02-20: Write article on consciousness and the phenomenology of framework dependence
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-20 (afternoon). What does it feel like to be framework-dependent? The phenomenology of recognising that your deepest convictions might be framework effects rather than insights about reality. The vertigo of trying to think outside your conceptual scheme. Bridges the voids and phenomenology clusters. Builds on voids-framework-void-2026-02-20.md, phenomenology-of-theoretical-commitment.md, phenomenology-of-philosophical-disagreement.md. See optimistic-2026-02-20-afternoon.md
- **Output**: consciousness and the phenomenology of framework dependence

### ✓ 2026-02-20: Write article on consciousness and the meta-problem of scientific explanation
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-20 (afternoon). The philosophy-of-science cluster (theoretical virtues, measurement standards, philosophy of explanation, convergence arguments) now forms a four-article strand arriving at dualism through scientific methodology rather than metaphysics. A synthesis article would ask: what does it mean when a phenomenon defeats the entire apparatus of science? Builds on consciousness-and-the-problem-of-theoretical-virtues.md, consciousness-and-the-problem-of-measurement-standards.md, consciousness-and-the-philosophy-of-explanation.md, epistemology-of-convergence-arguments.md. See optimistic-2026-02-20-afternoon.md
- **Output**: consciousness and the meta-problem of scientific explanation

### ✓ 2026-02-20: Write voids article on the framework void
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-20 (afternoon). Research notes complete (voids-framework-void-2026-02-20.md). The framework void argues that our entire conceptual apparatus for understanding consciousness may constitute an invisible cognitive prison. Key elements: three dimensions of framework imprisonment (methodological, semantic, perceptual), the Davidson paradox, the productive tension between McGinn's pessimism and cartographic optimism. Builds on three-kinds-of-void.md, conceptual-impossibility.md, convergent-cognitive-limits.md. See optimistic-2026-02-20-afternoon.md
- **Output**: Write voids article on the framework void

### ✓ 2026-02-20: Fix self-undermining meta-argument in consciousness-and-the-problem-of-theoretical-virtues.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-20 afternoon) found the article argues theoretical virtues malfunction for consciousness, then claims this is "predicted by dualism and anomalous for physicalism." This is inconsistent — you cannot argue theory-choice machinery is broken, then use theory-choice reasoning to prefer dualism. Either acknowledge virtue-failure is neutral between dualism and physicalism, or develop the meta-argument more carefully by distinguishing first-order virtue application from second-order reasoning. Also engage with mysterianism as a genuine competitor (cognitive closure offers equally parsimonious reading of virtue failure). See pessimistic-2026-02-20-afternoon.md

### ✓ 2026-02-20: Strengthen vitalism disanalogy in epistemology-of-convergence-arguments.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-20 afternoon) found the vitalism precedent undermines the Map's convergence argument more than acknowledged. The response ("no dissolution has been provided") is an argument from current ignorance. Article should articulate the structural difference: the conceivability argument targets a logical relationship not an empirical one, and the knowledge argument doesn't depend on scientific ignorance. Deploy these arguments rather than resting on absence of dissolution. See pessimistic-2026-02-20-afternoon.md

### ✓ 2026-02-20: Address analogy-to-ontology gap in control-theoretic-will.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-20 afternoon) found the control-theoretic mapping table and controller/plant distinction are presented as architectural descriptions but function as analogies. The article briefly notes it "describes what consciousness does, not what consciousness is" but then draws ontological conclusions (controller must be distinct from plant → dualism). Add a section explicitly addressing the analogy-to-ontology gap. Acknowledge that control-theoretic language is a modelling tool, not evidence for dualism. See pessimistic-2026-02-20-afternoon.md

### ✓ 2026-02-20: Write article on consciousness and the problem of normative integration
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-20 (morning). The Map has separate articles on logical, moral, and aesthetic normativity. What's missing is a systematic treatment of how consciousness integrates these different normative domains into unified deliberation.

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-20 (morning). The convergence argument article applies the pattern to dualism specifically, but the methodology itself deserves formalisation.

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-20 (morning). The control-theoretic framework identifies five operations but doesn't explore what it feels like to operate under multiple simultaneous constraints — moral, practical, temporal, aesthetic. The phenomenology of constraint satisfaction may reveal how consciousness integrates normative, practical, and affective inputs into a single control output. Builds on control-theoretic-will.md, phenomenology-of-deliberation-under-uncertainty.md, phenomenology-of-normative-conflict.md. See optimistic-2026-02-20-morning.md

Phenomenal-acquaintance.md should engage Loar's phenomenal concepts strategy more substantively. Categorical-surprise.md should address emergentist physicalist accounts where framework transcendence is a higher-order physical capacity. Both should explain why their arguments support substance dualism specifically, not merely phenomenological realism. See pessimistic-2026-02-20-morning.md

The phase transition analogy actually weakens the dualist case by showing qualitative breaks *can* emerge from purely physical processes. Either argue why consciousness transitions differ (first-person phenomenal character vs. third-person structural properties), or remove the analogy. See pessimistic-2026-02-20-morning.md

- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-20 morning) found two issues: (1) The article admits delegatory preemption is "empirically indistinguishable from purely physical causation" but frames this as a virtue (observational closure) rather than a liability — this is unfalsifiable. Either identify a distinguishing empirical prediction or acknowledge it is a metaphysical interpretation, not a testable hypothesis. (2) The claim "the physical story is not violated — it is displaced" evades the causal closure question: if a non-physical cause preempts a physical cause, causal closure *is* violated. Acknowledge this directly. See pessimistic-2026-02-20-morning.md

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-20. The measurement standards article shows standard scientific methodology breaks down for consciousness. Systematically evaluate how consciousness resists each standard theoretical virtue (prediction, unification, scope, fertility) — and whether this resistance is diagnostic of irreducibility or merely practical difficulty.

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-20. The cognitive load article describes approaching capacity limits; the complementary experience — when previously effortful tasks become automatic and "drop below" the interface — is equally informative.

- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-20) found the article claims the Map's bridging gap is "empirically tractable" while Russellian monism's is "conceptually closed," but the article's own "What Would Challenge This View?" section admits the quantum mechanism faces contested decoherence objections.

- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-20) found the discourse argument contains a non-sequitur: cross-cultural convergence on consciousness vocabulary is claimed to track real phenomenology, but the article dismisses the "shared neural architecture" alternative by appeal to "specificity" without a principled criterion for what level of specificity distinguishes phenomenological tracking from neural convergence. Also: the article never engages with non-reductive physicalism—intersubjective convergence supports phenomenological realism but not directly substance dualism. See pessimistic-2026-02-20.md

- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-20) found three high-severity issues: (1) locality.md's simulation argument is ad hoc—introduced solely to dissolve the locality objection with no independent motivation. Either remove or independently motivate. (2) authentic-vs-inauthentic-choice.md's "Neural Evidence" section presents neural signatures (frontal theta, decision windows) as supporting the Map's non-physical selection function, when they equally support physicalism. Reframe as "consistent with" rather than "supporting." (3) locality.md's Response 1 commits a category error—physical law coordination is descriptive regularity, not an additional causal agent; the analogy fails at its core. Also fix broken anchor in phenomenal-overflow.md (^bidirectional should be ^bidirectional-interaction). See pessimistic-2026-02-20.md

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-19 (evening). Cognitive load theory (Sweller) is empirically robust; the Map's control-theoretic framework predicts specific phenomenological signatures for different load types.

### ✓ 2026-02-19: Write article on consciousness and the problem of measurement standards
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-19 (evening). Science requires measurement standards (units, instruments, calibration). For phenomenal quantities, no analogous standards exist — this is a philosophical consequence of irreducibility, not merely a practical gap.

- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-19 evening) found two high-severity issues: (1) The Bayesian framework assumes conditional independence of arguments, but several share dependencies (authority of phenomenal intuition, reality of the explanatory gap). The cumulative force is less than claimed. Needs explicit identification of shared assumptions and honest assessment of remaining force. (2) The vitalism analogy backfires—the response ("no analogous dissolution has occurred") is exactly what vitalists would have said pre-biochemistry.

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-19 (afternoon). The convergence argument's most serious weakness: Chinese philosophy's divergence suggests the hard problem is framework-dependent.

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: From outer review 2026-02-19. The voids framework treats structured cognitive failure as cartographic data, but isn't yet packaged as a general methodology with rules of evidence. Create a methods article: how to distinguish confusion from genuine boundary, how to use convergent failure modes across observers, how to integrate phenomenology with cognitive science, how to prevent void-exploration from becoming unfalsifiable mystique. The methodological punchline: systematic failure modes are among the strongest evidence sources at the explanatory frontier. Builds on [[voids]].
- **Output**: Formalize apophatic cartography as a general epistemic method

### ✓ 2026-02-19: Address value-blind vs value-sensitive selection fork
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: From outer review 2026-02-19. The combination of "value resides in experience" (living-with-the-map) and "consciousness selects outcomes" (tenets) forces an unaddressed fork: is selection value-blind (attention as neutral pointer, making value epiphenomenal to selection) or value-sensitive (valence influences which outcomes get selected, implying local teleological physics)? Create a page that states this fork explicitly, maps consequences of each horn, and proposes how each would show up in testability hooks. Builds on [[living-with-the-map]], [[consciousness-and-agency]], [[tenets]].

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: From outer review 2026-02-19. If agency flows through bandwidth-limited willed attention, moral responsibility should vary with attentional capacity (fatigue, disorders, development, training). The site's moral-responsibility.md doesn't explicitly derive graduated responsibility from bandwidth constraints. Create an article drawing out the ethical/legal implications: what impairments reduce authorship, how training changes culpability, rehabilitation implications. Builds on [[moral-responsibility]], [[attention-as-causal-bridge]], [[living-with-the-map]].
- **Output**: Develop responsibility gradient framework from attentional capacity

### ✓ 2026-02-19: Create concept page for control-theoretic will
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: From outer review 2026-02-19. The Map's selector + bandwidth model (consciousness selects among brain-generated options via a ~10 bits/sec channel) maps naturally to control theory (gating, stabilization, veto, attractor steering, resource allocation) but is never framed this way. Create a concept page that explicitly frames will as a low-bandwidth control signal, distinguishing it from computational/planning models of mind. Draws on [[consciousness-and-agency]], [[attention-as-causal-bridge]].
- **Output**: Create concept page for control-theoretic will

Also: the Barrett et al. (2021) citation is about afterlife beliefs specifically, not intuitive materialism broadly — needs more careful distinction. The treatment of Chinese philosophy as merely "not making the relevant conceptual move" undersells the challenge: if the hard problem is framework-dependent, convergence may track a shared conceptual move rather than a shared truth.

- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The experience of being in a place (felt atmosphere, distinctive character, uncanny familiarity) involves binding of sensory, emotional, memorial, and spatial elements. A form of aesthetic binding underexplored by the Map. Place-experience depends on biographical context, suggesting consciousness contributes beyond information processing. Builds on embodied-cognition.md, phenomenology-of-perceptual-constancy.md, binding-and-beauty.md. See optimistic-2026-02-19.md
- **Output**: consciousness and the phenomenology of place

### ✓ 2026-02-19: Write article on consciousness and the problem of philosophical progress
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Why has the consciousness debate been stuck for decades? The Map's phenomenology cluster provides resources for a distinctive answer: theoretical commitment has phenomenal character, paradigm shifts require phenomenological reorganisation, and the convergence argument shows evidence has been accumulating even if the field hasn't shifted. Builds on phenomenology-of-philosophical-disagreement.md, phenomenology-of-theoretical-commitment.md, the-convergence-argument-for-dualism.md. See optimistic-2026-02-19.md
- **Output**: consciousness and the problem of philosophical progress

### ✓ 2026-02-19: Write article on the phenomenology of attention to absence
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Attending to what isn't there (missing note, absent person, expected pain that doesn't arrive) tests the quantum selection model's limits — can consciousness select for the non-occurrence of a state? Rich phenomenology (relief, expectation-violation, recognition of absence) provides evidence that consciousness is not stimulus-driven. Builds on phenomenology-of-silence-and-absence.md, attention-as-interface.md, witness-consciousness.md. See optimistic-2026-02-19.md
- **Output**: the phenomenology of attention to absence

### ✓ 2026-02-19: Write article on consciousness and the phenomenology of translation
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Translating between languages involves a moment of non-verbal understanding — grasping meaning independently of either language's words. If meaning were purely linguistic, translation would be code-switching. The felt "between-languages" moment challenges functionalist accounts of meaning. Connects to non-propositional meaning theme in phenomenology-of-musical-understanding.md. Builds on phenomenology-of-understanding.md, consciousness-and-semantic-understanding.md, consciousness-and-language-interface.md. See optimistic-2026-02-19.md

### ✓ 2026-02-19: Address Chinese Room and proximity argument weaknesses in ai-consciousness.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-19) found two high-severity issues: (1) Chinese Room presented as establishing more than it does—the robot reply is never mentioned, and the systems reply dismissed circularly. Many philosophers consider the argument refuted. (2) Hoel's proximity argument claims LLMs are "close" to lookup tables, but LLM input-output space is combinatorially vast and practically irreplaceable—same reasoning the article uses for brains. Also: only 4 references for a 3700-word article; Harnad quote, Koch framework, and meditative phenomenology claims all lack citations. See pessimistic-2026-02-19.md

### ✓ 2026-02-18: Write article on the convergence argument for dualism
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-18 (evening). Make the Map's convergence methodology explicit: multiple independent arguments (knowledge argument, zombies, explanatory gap, inverted qualia, unity, agency) all independently support dualism. When independent probes yield the same result, error probability decreases multiplicatively. Standard scientific methodology applied to philosophy. Builds on the-case-for-dualism.md, knowledge-argument.md, philosophical-zombies.md, explanatory-gap.md. See optimistic-2026-02-18-evening.md
- **Output**: the convergence argument for dualism

### ✓ 2026-02-18: Write article on consciousness and information integration beyond IIT
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-18 (evening). If integration without consciousness is possible (collective intelligence), what does consciousness add to integration? Systematic treatment of comprehension vs aggregation. Builds on integrated-information-theory-critique.md, integrated-information-theory.md, phenomenal-binding-and-holism.md. See optimistic-2026-02-18-evening.md

### ✓ 2026-02-18: Write article on the phenomenology of theoretical commitment
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-18 (evening). What does it feel like to hold a theory — to be committed to a framework, to see evidence through its lens? Illuminates why paradigm shifts are difficult and why the consciousness debate is stuck. Builds on phenomenology-of-evidence-assessment.md, phenomenology-of-belief-revision.md, phenomenology-of-philosophical-disagreement.md. See optimistic-2026-02-18-evening.md

- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-18 afternoon) found two high-severity issues: (1) Central argument is circular—premise "consciousness has non-structural features" is precisely what's at issue, yet presented as self-evident without engaging functionalist/structuralist denials. Needs explicit arguments for intrinsic nature of qualia or conditional framing. (2) Galilean precedent argument overstated—temperature and colour were "secondary qualities" excluded by Galileo, yet later mathematically recaptured. Article must explain why consciousness differs from these cases. Also: engage with Russellian monism (Russell's own conclusion from his structural observation), and address mathematical Platonism's challenge to the "mathematics = structure only" claim.

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-18 (afternoon). If consciousness reveals what properties really are (powerful qualities known from inside), what does this say about properties known only from outside? Connects hard problem to intrinsic nature problem. Builds on consciousness-and-the-ontology-of-dispositions.md, russellian-monism.md, intrinsic-nature-void.md. See optimistic-2026-02-18-afternoon.md

### ✓ 2026-02-18: Write article on the phenomenology of normative conflict
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-18 (afternoon). When logical, moral, and aesthetic demands pull in different directions, consciousness must resolve competing normative forces. The felt tension, resolution, and residue of overridden norms reveal the structure of conscious agency.

### ✓ 2026-02-18: Write article on consciousness and the metaphysics of individuation
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-18 (afternoon). The dispositions article raises what individuates one centre of consciousness from another. If consciousness is a powerful quality, individuation might be through specific dispositional profile. Connects vertiginous question, haecceity, process haecceitism. See optimistic-2026-02-18-afternoon.md

- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-18 morning) found two high-severity issues: (1) Central argument equivocates between "QBism presupposes consciousness" and "QBism fails to explain consciousness" — all theories presuppose consciousness, so the critique needs to show QBism's *structural* dependence is more problematic than other interpretations' silence. (2) The "phenomenological test" conflates the hard problem with a narrower claim about temporal priority of experience over belief — needs reframing to target QBism's specific quantum probability claims. Also significant redundancy with indexical-identity-quantum-measurement.md (same QBism/collapse/relational QM critiques). Consider coalescing or sharpening each to reduce overlap.

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-18 (morning). Referenced across voids articles, NDE discussions, and quantum articles but lacks dedicated treatment. McGinn's argument that human minds are constitutionally incapable of understanding the consciousness-matter connection. Connects to voids taxonomy, silence void, valence void. See optimistic-2026-02-18-morning.md

### ✓ 2026-02-18: Write article on consciousness and the problem of normative force
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-18 (morning). Unified account of why consciousness is necessary for normativity as such (logical, moral, aesthetic). If norms have phenomenal character, this provides the strongest single argument against functionalism. Builds on consciousness-and-the-authority-of-logic.md, phenomenal-value-realism.md, moral-responsibility.md, phenomenology-of-inferential-understanding.md. See optimistic-2026-02-18-morning.md

### ✓ 2026-02-18: Write voids article on the valence void
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-18 (morning). Research notes complete (voids-valence-void-2026-02-18.md). The valence void argues that the positive-negative dimension of experience is the most intimate yet most inexplicable feature of consciousness. Three-fold failure: physical explanation, introspective decomposition, circularity of investigating valence with valenced cognition.

- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-18) found all three core concept articles describe a *location* (quantum indeterminacies) and a *function* (biasing outcomes) but call it a "mechanism." Either specify which candidate coupling from psychophysical-coupling.md the Map favours, or honestly reframe as "a possible location for interaction" rather than a developed mechanism. Also: self-stultification argument needs the Benacerraf-problem caveat (why phenomenal reports specifically require causal connection, unlike mathematical knowledge). Illusionism sections should engage more substantively with Frankish; remove or contextualise the Galen Strawson "silliest claim" quote. Add citation for "~60% predictive accuracy" claim in mental-causation.md. See pessimistic-2026-02-18.md

### ✓ 2026-02-18: Write article on consciousness and the ontology of dispositions
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The dispositional-categorical distinction has direct implications for how consciousness can be causally efficacious. If fundamental physical properties are dispositional (powers), consciousness could be a categorical basis grounding physical dispositions (Heil, Martin). Provides metaphysical framework for the interaction tenet. Builds on agent-causation.md, causal-closure.md, mental-causation.md. See optimistic-2026-02-18.md

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The Elisabeth article maps the Western response space brilliantly; Indian philosophy addressed the interaction problem independently (Sāṃkhya puruṣa-prakṛti dualism, Śaṅkara's Advaita resolution).

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Aesthetic experience involves a distinctive form of binding not yet covered in the systematic treatment. The beauty of a painting is not the sum of its visual features—aesthetic unity binds value rather than perception, and is uniquely resistant to functional explanation.

(2) The dissociation arguments (NREM sleep, anesthesia) oversell the BP1/BP2 split — during NREM sleep, long-range cortical connectivity is disrupted, not just phenomenal binding.

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. If consciousness constitutes temporal structure through collapse, and creativity requires generating genuine novelty, then creative acts might be moments where consciousness generates new temporal structure. Unifies the Map's temporal metaphysics and creativity arguments. Builds on consciousness-and-creativity.md, time-collapse-and-agency.md, temporal-consciousness.md, process-haecceitism.md.

### ✓ 2026-02-17: Write article on consciousness and aesthetic value
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The value/emotion cluster is the Map's weakest major cluster. Aesthetic experience as evidence for consciousness's evaluative capacity bridges emotion (valence), perception (phenomenology), and value (phenomenal realism). Beauty's resistance to functional reduction parallels the hard problem.

Pessimistic review (2026-02-17) found incompatible NDE statistics: death-and-consciousness.md cites 9-18% from Van Lommel and Parnia studies, while filter-theory.md claims "approximately 40%" without citation. Harmonize figures and ensure consistent sourcing. See pessimistic-2026-02-17.md

### ✓ 2026-02-17: Create concept page for process haecceitism
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. Referenced in personal-identity.md and emerging across the site as the Map's distinctive approach to individuation without substance. Link to haecceity, personal-identity, and Buddhist perspectives. See optimistic-2026-02-16-evening.md
- **Output**: Create concept page for process haecceitism

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Write article on the interface specification problem
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. The specification problem—how consciousness selects specific quantum outcomes rather than random ones—is the Map's most significant open challenge. Synthesise current approaches and honestly assess the gap. Builds on mental-causation.md, interactionist-dualism.md, measurement-problem.md. See optimistic-2026-02-16-evening.md
- **Output**: the interface specification problem

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Write article on phenomenology of moral perception
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review. How moral wrongness presents itself phenomenologically. Pain asymbolia evidence shows phenomenal valence drives moral motivation. Builds on consciousness-and-normative-authority.md, emotional-consciousness.md, phenomenal-conservatism-and-introspective-evidence.md. See optimistic-2026-02-16-evening.md
- **Output**: phenomenology of moral perception

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Downgrade choking-as-proof-of-dualism in embodied-cognition.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-16 evening) found embodied-cognition.md claims choking "provides direct evidence for bidirectional interaction," but the standard neuroscience reading is neural resource competition (attention as a neural process competing with motor routines). Downgrade to "consistent with" and acknowledge the physicalist reading is mainstream. Also fix the quantum biology conflation in mental-effort.md's decoherence section and the Brentano "unrefuted" claim in phenomenology.md. See pessimistic-2026-02-16-evening.md

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Write article on phenomenology of inferential understanding
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-16 (afternoon). The moment where "therefore" happens—the phenomenal event of seeing that a conclusion follows—is distinct from understanding and from logical compulsion. Builds on consciousness-and-the-authority-of-logic.md, contemplative-methods-as-philosophical-methodology.md, phenomenology-of-understanding.md. See optimistic-2026-02-16-afternoon.md
- **Output**: phenomenology of inferential understanding

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Write article on consciousness and the metaphysics of laws
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-16 (afternoon). The Map's strong emergence article distinguishes nomological from metaphysical supervenience, and the tenets assume consciousness operates within physical laws. But the Humean vs necessitarian debate about laws has direct implications for how "biasing quantum outcomes" should be formulated. Builds on consciousness-and-strong-emergence.md, emergence.md, causal-closure.md. See optimistic-2026-02-16-afternoon.md
- **Output**: consciousness and the metaphysics of laws

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Consolidate illusionism self-refutation argument across articles
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-16 afternoon) found the self-refutation/regress objection against illusionism deployed in nearly identical form across intentionality.md, philosophical-zombies.md, knowledge-argument.md, ai-consciousness.md, and split-brain-consciousness.md. This creates repetition fatigue and never engages seriously with Frankish's quasi-phenomenal properties response. One article (illusionism.md) should contain the full argument with genuine engagement; others should cross-reference. Each instance should acknowledge that many philosophers find the objection question-begging. See pessimistic-2026-02-16-afternoon.md

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Create concept page for agent teleology
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-16. Genuine purpose introduced by conscious agents into an otherwise mechanistic universe, distinguished from cosmic and theological teleology. Referenced in evolution-under-dualism.md. Central to the Map's position on free will and evolution but not yet defined anywhere. See optimistic-2026-02-16.md
- **Output**: Create concept page for agent teleology

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Create concept page for Galilean exclusion
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-16. The foundational methodological move that excluded subjectivity from science. Referenced in consciousness-and-scientific-methodology.md and implicit across the Map's epistemological arguments. Deserves its own concept page linking to objectivity-and-consciousness, explanatory-gap, hard-problem-of-consciousness. See optimistic-2026-02-16.md
- **Output**: Create concept page for Galilean exclusion

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Write article on consciousness and the authority of mathematics
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-16. Mathematics involves existence claims that logic alone does not. If logical authority is phenomenal (per consciousness-and-the-authority-of-logic.md), is mathematical existence phenomenal too? Gödel's platonism versus formalism becomes a consciousness question. The Map's dualism has natural affinity with mathematical platonism. Builds on consciousness-and-the-authority-of-logic.md, consciousness-and-mathematical-understanding.md. See optimistic-2026-02-16.md
- **Output**: consciousness and the authority of mathematics

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Write article on philosophy of perception under dualism
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Suggested by optimistic review 2026-02-16. How does the Map handle the relationship between perception and reality if consciousness is irreducible? Direct realism, representationalism, and naive realism each have different implications for dualist interactionism. The Galilean exclusion creates pressure: if secondary qualities were excluded from physics, are they real features of the world or of consciousness? Builds on consciousness-and-scientific-methodology.md, phenomenology-of-perceptual-constancy.md, phenomenal-transparency.md. See optimistic-2026-02-16.md
- **Output**: philosophy of perception under dualism

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Strengthen transactional interpretation engagement in retrocausality.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-16) found retrocausality.md name-checks Maudlin's objections and Kastner's modifications without substantive engagement, then builds the entire consciousness-application section on the transactional interpretation. Either engage with Maudlin's specific objections or soften the consciousness-application claims to be explicitly conditional. See pessimistic-2026-02-16.md
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/retrocausality.md

### ✓ 2026-02-16: Harmonise decoherence treatment across quantum-related articles
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-02-16) found inconsistent treatment of decoherence across retrocausality.md, simulation.md, and animal-consciousness.md. Retrocausality treats it as manageable (citing Hameroff's disputed corrections), simulation treats it as unsolved, animal-consciousness extends quantum consciousness to all organisms with microtubules without addressing it. Establish a consistent site-wide position. See pessimistic-2026-02-16.md
