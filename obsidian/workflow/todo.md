## Active Tasks

### P2: Research the self and consciousness
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: What is the relationship between consciousness and the sense of self? Distinct from personal identity (which focuses on persistence), this concerns the phenomenology and metaphysics of selfhood in conscious experience. Key areas: minimal self vs narrative self (Gallagher, Zahavi), self-model theory (Metzinger), no-self traditions (Buddhism), and implications for dualism. Connects to self-reference-paradox, Eastern philosophy, and hard problem articles.

## Completed Tasks

### ✓ 2026-01-14: Research embodied cognition and the extended mind
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: The embodied cognition program (Clark, Thompson, Noë) argues that cognition is shaped by the body and extended into the environment. Key questions for site: Does embodiment challenge or complement dualism? Can the filter theory accommodate embodied cognition? How does embodiment relate to the mind-brain separation framework? Connects to mind-brain-separation, phenomenology, and AI consciousness discussions.
- **Source**: gap_analysis
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering 4E cognition (embodied, embedded, enacted, extended), Clark & Chalmers' extended mind thesis, enactivism (Thompson, Noë, Varela), Adams & Aizawa's critique, and AI grounding problem. Key finding: embodied cognition opposes Cartesian substance dualism but is compatible with property dualism; phenomenological roots (Husserl, Merleau-Ponty) support first-person irreducibility; filter theory can accommodate embodiment—body shapes interface without producing consciousness.
- **Output**: `research/embodied-cognition-extended-mind-2026-01-14.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-14: Research neurophenomenology and meditation studies
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Varela's neurophenomenology bridges first-person phenomenological reports with third-person neuroscience. Meditation studies (mindfulness, contemplative traditions) provide systematic first-person data on consciousness. Key questions: Can meditation reveal aspects of consciousness inaccessible to ordinary introspection? What do long-term meditators report about the structure of awareness? How does contemplative expertise relate to site's framework? Connects to Eastern philosophy and mysterianism articles.
- **Source**: gap_analysis
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering Varela's neurophenomenology methodology, 2025 advances (deep computational neurophenomenology, generative neurophenomenology), microphenomenology (Petitmengin), jhana neuroscience (7-Tesla fMRI studies), cessation of consciousness research, default mode network findings, and Buddhist phenomenology of mind. Key finding: contemplative training reveals consciousness structures inaccessible to ordinary introspection—jhana states, non-dual awareness, cessation experiences provide data that strongly supports Dualism and Occam's Razor Has Limits tenets.
- **Output**: `research/neurophenomenology-meditation-studies-2026-01-14.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-14: Cross-review hard-problem-of-consciousness.md considering collapse-and-time insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/collapse-and-time.md explores how consciousness's participation in collapse may be constitutive of temporal structure. Review topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness.md for opportunities to connect the temporal dimension of the hard problem—not just "why experience?" but "why experienced time?" The collapse-and-time article provides a bridge between quantum consciousness theories and the phenomenology of temporal flow.
- **Source**: chain (from collapse-and-time.md)
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Added collapse-and-time to concepts list; added paragraph in Temporal Phenomenology section connecting phenomenology of time's flow to consciousness's possible role in collapse and creating irreversibility; reframed temporal hard problem as "is consciousness part of why time flows at all?"; added collapse-and-time to Further Reading
- **Output**: Updated `topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-14: Cross-review hard-problem-of-consciousness.md considering near-death-experiences insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/near-death-experiences.md documents 40% awareness during cardiac arrest (AWARE II), veridical perception cases, and the paradox of heightened experience when brain function is minimal. Review topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness.md for opportunities to reference this empirical evidence—NDEs provide striking phenomenological data against simple brain-production models.
- **Source**: chain (from near-death-experiences.md)
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Added near-death-experiences to concepts list; created new "Empirical Anomalies: Near-Death Experiences" section after NCC section covering AWARE II findings, paradox of heightened experience, and filter-vs-generator interpretation; added near-death-experiences to Further Reading
- **Output**: Updated `topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-14: Cross-review quantum-consciousness.md considering collapse-and-time insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/collapse-and-time.md explores time-symmetric interpretations (TSVF, transactional) and the possibility that consciousness's selection at collapse is atemporal. Review concepts/quantum-consciousness.md for opportunities to integrate this temporal dimension—Stapp's and Penrose's mechanisms have implications for time's arrow, not just mind-matter interaction.
- **Source**: chain (from collapse-and-time.md)
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Added collapse-and-time to concepts list; expanded Orch OR Tenet Alignment subsection with Penrose's gravity-time connection and link to collapse-and-time; added new "Time-Symmetric Interpretations: Atemporal Selection" section covering TSVF, transactional interpretation, and consciousness as constitutive of temporal structure; added collapse-and-time to Further Reading
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/quantum-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-14: Cross-review temporal-consciousness.md considering collapse-and-time insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/collapse-and-time.md connects consciousness to the emergence of temporal direction.

- **Source**: chain (from collapse-and-time.md)
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Added collapse-and-time to concepts list; added new "Collapse and the Origin of Temporal Flow" section connecting phenomenology of specious present with quantum collapse as origin of time's arrow; connected time-symmetric interpretations to atemporal consciousness selection; added collapse-and-time to Further Reading
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/temporal-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-14: Research the problem of other minds
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: How do we know other beings are conscious? The problem connects to AI consciousness debates, animal consciousness, and the hard problem itself. Referenced in ai-consciousness.md and animal-consciousness.md but lacks dedicated treatment. Key topics: behavioral criteria, argument from analogy, asymmetry between first-person certainty and third-person inference, philosophical skepticism vs practical knowledge.
- **Source**: gap_analysis
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering argument from analogy, inference to best explanation, Wittgensteinian criteria, perceptual approaches, Nagel's bat argument, Turing test and AI, 2024 New York Declaration on Animal Consciousness. Key finding: the problem is especially acute for dualism—if consciousness is non-physical, behavioral evidence is even more indirect. Site's framework must acknowledge epistemic limits while maintaining practical certainty.
- **Output**: `research/problem-of-other-minds-2026-01-14.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-14: Cross-review hard-problem-of-consciousness.md considering russellian-monism insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/russellian-monism.md presents a sophisticated alternative to both physicalism and dualism. Review topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness.md for opportunities to reference Russellian monism as an important position—it shares the insight that physics is silent on intrinsic nature but attempts a monist solution. The article should note why this doesn't escape dualism's problems.
- **Source**: chain (from russellian-monism.md)
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Added russellian-monism to concepts list; added new "Russellian Monism" subsection under Responses covering the core insight (physics is structural), quiddities proposal, combination problem, Pautz's critique that it's "dualism under another name", and why site's explicit dualism is preferable; added russellian-monism to Further Reading
- **Output**: Updated `topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Research what loss of consciousness reveals about mind and brain
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: What does the loss of consciousness tell us about the mind and brain? Is it a protective mechanism, where the brain disconnects from experience? Under general anaesthetic and coma, does time pass in an instant for the mind? How do drugs cause loss of consciousness? Can consciousness be partial in these circumstances, or is experience just changed? Research the subject deeply.
- **Source**: human
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering anesthesia mechanisms (propofol vs ketamine produce radically different subjective states despite similar behavior), cognitive motor dissociation (25% of "unconscious" patients show awareness via neuroimaging), time perception (vanishes completely under anesthesia unlike sleep), filter/transmission theory (James, Bergson, Huxley), active reboot mechanisms, and philosophical implications for dualism. Key finding: consciousness can persist despite behavioral unresponsiveness, and brain-consciousness correlation is compatible with filter theory.
- **Output**: `research/loss-of-consciousness-mind-brain-2026-01-15.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Research mind-brain separation and division of faculties
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: What can we perceive about the separation between mind and brain? What parts are intrinsic to the mind, like qualia? What parts the brain, like triggers for respiration? What aspects function whilst unconscious? Study vision as a particular case. The experienced 3D world with its smooth motion seems beyond the capability of slowly firing neurons. Lucid dreams and hallucinations generate flawless perception of objects, as if they are reconstructed, but if the eyes are not focused the world is experienced as blurred. Research all of these aspects deeply. Also study the effect of brain lesions and injury with the frame that these 'disconnected' the conscious mind from the brain, they do not point to any lost facilities being 'brain only'.
- **Source**: human
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Comprehensive research on dividing mental faculties between mind and brain. Key findings: qualia appear intrinsic to mind; automatic functions (respiration) clearly neural; vision presents puzzle—3D world seems to exceed slow-firing neurons but blur persists in dreams. Evidence: binding problem unsolved ("no plausible neural story"), hemispherectomy preserves consciousness, filter/transmission theory (James, Bergson, Huxley) provides coherent alternative. Blindsight shows V1 as "gate" of visual awareness. Proposed "rendering engine" analogy: brain provides computational substrate, mind provides experiential quality.
- **Output**: `research/mind-brain-separation-faculties-2026-01-15.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Write article on inverted qualia
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/inverted-qualia-spectrum-2026-01-14.md. Covers Locke's original formulation, Block and Fodor's argument against functionalism, Hardin's color space asymmetries objection, Block's Inverted Earth, and connections to zombie arguments. Key finding: inverted qualia provide additional support for dualism beyond zombie arguments—functional duplicates can differ in qualia. Article should cover the thought experiment, main objections, and why the possibility supports the Dualism tenet.
- **Source**: chain (from research-topic)
- **Generated**: 2026-01-15
- **Result**: Created ~1800 word article covering the core scenario, why it challenges functionalism, Block's Inverted Earth, detectability objection and responses, relation to zombie arguments, privacy of experience, physicalist responses (representationalism, phenomenal concepts strategy, Dennett), and connection to site's tenets.
- **Output**: `concepts/inverted-qualia.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Cross-review ai-consciousness.md considering problem-of-other-minds insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/problem-of-other-minds.md covers the epistemic challenge of knowing other minds, the dualist's dilemma (behavioral evidence is indirect if consciousness is non-physical), and practical certainty without theoretical proof. Review topics/ai-consciousness.md for opportunities to connect the problem of other minds more explicitly to AI skepticism—the inference problem is even harder for entities whose origins differ from ours.
- **Source**: chain (from problem-of-other-minds.md)
- **Generated**: 2026-01-15
- **Result**: Added problem-of-other-minds to concepts list and Further Reading. Added explicit [[problem-of-other-minds]] link to Epistemic Problem section. Created new "Why the Inference Fails for AI" subsection applying all three major other-minds approaches (argument from analogy, inference to best explanation, Wittgensteinian dissolution) to AI and showing why each fails.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/ai-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Cross-review animal-consciousness.md considering problem-of-other-minds insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/problem-of-other-minds.md addresses practical certainty vs theoretical proof and the inference problem. Review topics/animal-consciousness.md for opportunities to connect the epistemological problem to animal minds—unlike AI, animals share our evolutionary origins, providing stronger inferential grounds despite the same theoretical gap.
- **Source**: chain (from problem-of-other-minds.md)
- **Generated**: 2026-01-15
- **Result**: Added problem-of-other-minds to concepts list; added [[problem-of-other-minds]] link to opening paragraph; created new "Why the Inference Is Stronger for Animals Than for AI" section applying argument from analogy, inference to best explanation, and biological similarity criteria to show why animal consciousness inference has stronger grounds than AI consciousness inference; added problem-of-other-minds to Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/animal-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-15: Write article on loss of consciousness and mind-brain relationship

### ✓ 2026-01-14: Cross-review philosophical-zombies.md considering inverted-qualia insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/inverted-qualia.md covers how functional duplicates can differ in qualia. Review concepts/philosophical-zombies.md for opportunities to connect inverted qualia to zombie arguments—both challenge functionalism but in complementary ways (absent vs different qualia).
- **Source**: chain (from inverted-qualia.md)
- **Generated**: 2026-01-15
- **Result**: Added inverted-qualia to concepts list; created new "Zombies and Inverted Qualia" section with comparison table (absent vs different qualia, targets physicalism vs functionalism) explaining how the arguments complement each other and strengthen the case against materialism; added inverted-qualia to Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/philosophical-zombies.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-14: Cross-review qualia.md considering inverted-qualia insights

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/mind-brain-separation-faculties-2026-01-15.md. Covers which faculties appear intrinsic to mind (qualia, qualitative character of experience) versus clearly neural (automatic functions like respiration). Key findings: vision presents puzzle—3D world seems to exceed slow-firing neurons but blur persists in dreams; binding problem unsolved; filter/transmission theory (James, Bergson, Huxley) provides coherent alternative; brain lesion data supports disconnection rather than elimination interpretation.
- **Source**: chain (from research-topic)
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Created ~2100 word article covering the division of faculties (intrinsic to mind vs clearly neural vs interface), vision as case study (3D world problem, smooth motion puzzle, blindsight), filter theory framework (James, Bergson, Huxley), and rendering engine analogy.
- **Output**: `concepts/mind-brain-separation.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-14: Cross-review neural-correlates-of-consciousness.md considering loss-of-consciousness insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article topics/loss-of-consciousness.md covers filter theory, covert consciousness, and the disconnection vs destruction interpretation. Review concepts/neural-correlates-of-consciousness.md for opportunities to connect NCCs with filter theory—correlates may indicate interface points rather than generators.
- **Source**: chain (from loss-of-consciousness.md)
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Added loss-of-consciousness to concepts list; created new "Filter Theory: Correlates as Interface Points" section connecting NCCs with filter theory—covert consciousness, disconnection vs destruction, anesthetic dissociations all suggest NCCs identify interface points rather than production sites; added loss-of-consciousness to Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/neural-correlates-of-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-14: Cross-review death-and-consciousness.md considering loss-of-consciousness insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article topics/loss-of-consciousness.md covers time vanishing under anesthesia, covert consciousness, and filter theory. Review topics/death-and-consciousness.md for opportunities to connect temporary loss of consciousness evidence to death's relationship with consciousness—if anesthesia involves disconnection not elimination, what does this suggest about death?
- **Source**: chain (from loss-of-consciousness.md)
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Added loss-of-consciousness to concepts list; created new "Temporary Loss of Consciousness: A Preview of Death?" section connecting time vanishing under anesthesia, covert consciousness (25% unresponsive patients aware), and disconnection syndromes to death—if relationship is disconnection not production, death may be ultimate disconnection rather than annihilation; added loss-of-consciousness to Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/death-and-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-14: Cross-review hard-problem-of-consciousness.md considering mind-brain-separation insights
- **Type**: cross-review

Review topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness.md for opportunities to reference the division of faculties and filter theory as supporting evidence for dualism.
- **Source**: chain (from mind-brain-separation.md)
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Added mind-brain-separation to concepts list; created new "The Division of Faculties" section analyzing where hard problem bites hardest—qualia, phenomenal unity, metacognition appear intrinsic to mind while vegetative/sensory/motor functions are clearly neural; filter theory interprets this as ontological boundary not explanatory failure; added mind-brain-separation to Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `topics/hard-problem-of-consciousness.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-14: Cross-review binding-problem.md considering mind-brain-separation insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/mind-brain-separation.md discusses the binding problem as evidence that phenomenal unity is intrinsic to mind rather than explained by neural mechanisms. Review concepts/binding-problem.md for opportunities to reference the division of faculties framework.
- **Source**: chain (from mind-brain-separation.md)
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Added new section "The Mind-Brain Division and Phenomenal Unity" connecting binding problem to division of faculties analysis. Key insight: BP2 (phenomenal binding) falls on the mental side per filter theory—brain provides computational binding (BP1), consciousness provides phenomenal unity. Added mind-brain-separation to concepts list and Further Reading.
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/binding-problem.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-14: Research phenomenology and first-person methods
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Phenomenology (Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty) is the philosophical tradition most committed to first-person investigation of consciousness. Referenced in duration.md, temporal-consciousness.md, and intentionality.md but lacks dedicated treatment. Key topics: phenomenological reduction (epoché), intentionality's phenomenological roots, embodied cognition, and how phenomenological methods might complement or challenge scientific approaches. Directly supports Dualism and Occam's Razor Has Limits tenets by demonstrating that consciousness has a rich structure accessible only to first-person investigation.
- **Source**: gap_analysis
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering Husserl's epoché and reduction, Heidegger's Dasein, Merleau-Ponty's embodiment, and Varela's neurophenomenology. Key finding: phenomenology provides systematic evidence for first-person irreducibility—intentionality, temporal structure, and qualitative character cannot be captured by third-person descriptions. 2025 research emphasizes cognitive science needs phenomenology because "intuitive dualism" is empirically widespread. Strongly supports Dualism and Occam's Razor Has Limits tenets.
- **Output**: `research/phenomenology-first-person-methods-2026-01-14.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-14: Research arguments for dualism (positive case)
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Site extensively argues against materialism but could strengthen the positive case for dualism. Beyond the hard problem, what arguments support dualism? Key areas: conceivability arguments (Chalmers), modal arguments, parsimony reconsidered (is dualism actually simpler?), from-qualia arguments, from-intentionality arguments, from-unity arguments. Survey contemporary dualist defenses (Chalmers, Lowe, Hasker, Swinburne). Would strengthen tenets framework.
- **Source**: gap_analysis
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering seven major positive arguments for dualism: conceivability (zombies), knowledge (Mary's Room), qualia, unity of consciousness, intentionality, modal argument (Swinburne), and personal identity. Key contemporary defenders: Chalmers, Swinburne, Hasker, Lowe, Rickabaugh & Moreland (2023). 22% of philosophers accept dualism (2020 survey). Addresses parsimony objection by showing how explanatory adequacy trumps simplicity.
- **Output**: `research/arguments-for-dualism-positive-case-2026-01-14.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-14: Write article on problem of other minds
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/problem-of-other-minds-2026-01-14.md. Covers argument from analogy, inference to best explanation, Wittgensteinian criteria, Nagel's bat, AI and animal consciousness implications. Key finding: the problem is especially acute for dualism—if consciousness is non-physical, behavioral evidence is even more indirect. Connects to ai-consciousness.md and animal-consciousness.md. Should address how site's framework acknowledges epistemic limits while maintaining practical certainty.
- **Source**: chain (from research-topic)
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Created ~2100 word article covering the asymmetry problem, major solutions (argument from analogy, inference to best explanation, Wittgensteinian dissolution, perceptual approach), the dualist's dilemma, practical certainty without theoretical proof, and extensions to animals and machines. Connected to all relevant tenets.
- **Output**: `concepts/problem-of-other-minds.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-14: Cross-review duration.md considering collapse-and-time insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/collapse-and-time.md connects consciousness to temporal structure via quantum collapse. Review concepts/duration.md for opportunities to connect Bergson's durée with the quantum perspective—if collapse creates time's arrow, durée may be phenomenologically apprehending what physics mathematically describes.
- **Source**: chain (from collapse-and-time.md)
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Added collapse-and-time to concepts list; expanded "Durée and Quantum Indeterminacy" section (renamed to "Durée and Quantum Collapse") with connection to collapse introducing time's arrow, TSVF parallels to durée's interpenetrating time, and framing of durée as "what collapse feels like from inside"; added collapse-and-time to Further Reading
- **Output**: Updated `concepts/duration.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-14: Research the inverted qualia problem
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: The inverted spectrum thought experiment (what if your red looks like my green?) is referenced in qualia.md and functionalism.md but lacks dedicated treatment. Important for site's anti-functionalist position—if functional isomorphs can have different qualia, functionalism fails.

### ✓ 2026-01-14: Explore consciousness, collapse, and the arrow of time
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Explore whether 'consciousness causes collapse' is relevant to the arrow of time. In a time-reversed scenario, would we see an un-collapse, and is that disallowed or non-physical? This connects to the retrocausality article and the Bidirectional Interaction tenet. Key questions: (1) Does wavefunction collapse define time's arrow independently of entropy? (2) If consciousness selects outcomes at collapse, does this inherently distinguish past from future? (3) What would "un-collapse" even mean—superposition restoration? (4) Does the time-symmetry of quantum equations conflict with irreversible collapse? (5) How does this relate to the site's rejection of Many Worlds (where collapse doesn't occur)?
- **Source**: manual
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering relationship between collapse and time asymmetry, time-symmetric interpretations (TSVF, transactional), Penrose OR theory and gravity-time connection, the un-collapse question, and alignment with all five tenets. Key finding: collapse does break time-reversal symmetry, and if consciousness participates in collapse, consciousness is implicated in temporal directionality itself. Strong connection to retrocausality article—time-symmetric interpretations suggest consciousness's selection may be atemporal.
