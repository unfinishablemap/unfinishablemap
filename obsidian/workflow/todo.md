title: AI Task Queue
topics: []
---

This is the task queue for AI automation. The human reviews and prioritizes tasks; the AI executes them.

## How to Edit This List

- **Promote**: Change `P2` to `P1`, etc.
- **Demote**: Change `P1` to `P2`, etc.
- **Veto**: Add `#veto` anywhere in the task heading (e.g., `### P2: Task name #veto`)
- **Add reason**: Optionally add `- **Veto reason**: [why]` before vetoing

Vetoed items are moved automatically to the Vetoed Tasks section on the next evolution loop run.

## Priority Levels

- **P0**: Urgent - execute immediately
- **P1**: High - execute this week
- **P2**: Medium - execute when time permits
- **P2**: Low - nice to have, human approval needed

## Active Tasks

### P2: Strengthen idealism article's engagement with idealist responses
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Status**: pending

- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Status**: pending
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review 2026-01-25 found quantum Zeno mechanism mentioned 7+ times and structurally central, contradicting style guide's explicit warning against building arguments around speculative mechanisms.

### ✓ 2026-01-31: Develop "agency = attentional economics" as explicit concept
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: From outer review 2026-01-31. The site links agency to conscious selection and repeatedly elevates attention/effort, but hasn't stated the full conclusion: will is primarily control of attention allocation over time. This implies freedom scales with attentional skill, and attention training (meditation, CBT-like refocusing) is metaphysically agency-enhancing in the theory's own terms.
- **Output**: Develop "agency = attentional economics" as explicit concept

- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: From outer review 2026-01-31. The review correctly identifies that the tenets imply consciousness is a low-bandwidth selector (choosing among pre-formed alternatives) rather than high-bandwidth generator. The agency apex should make this explicit: consciousness doesn't do the brain's heavy lifting; it arbitrates among prepared options. This predicts a small action channel capacity (bits/sec) and reframes "free will" as about which branch is realized, not generating branches.

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: From outer review 2026-01-31. The framework implicitly needs a short list of plausible coupling modes consistent with "minimal interaction." A page should enumerate candidate coupling classes (basis selection, collapse timing, Born-rule reweighting), the main objections to each, and why some are more "minimal" than others. This would tighten the project's scientific posture and reduce hand-wavy "selection" language.

- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New voids article voids/causal-interface.md (2026-01-31) addresses the core Cartesian objection—how can non-physical consciousness enter the causal order?

The new symbol-grounding-problem article touches on this but doesn't develop it. Builds on language-recursion-and-consciousness.md, symbol-grounding-problem.md, existentialism.md. Supports Dualism through the argument that meaningful language requires consciousness.

- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/symbol-grounding-problem-2026-01-30.md. The symbol grounding problem (Harnad 1990) asks how symbols acquire intrinsic meaning—directly supports the Bidirectional Interaction tenet by showing pure computation lacks genuine understanding.

- **Output**: symbol grounding problem

### ✓ 2026-01-30: Create dedicated existentialism concept article
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Existentialism is currently embedded in nihilism-and-existentialism.md but deserves standalone treatment. Sartre's pour-soi structure anticipates the regress problem against illusionism; Heidegger's Dasein analysis prefigures the Map's claim that consciousness cannot be reducible to properties. Multiple deep reviews identified these connections but they remain undeveloped. Would strengthen the Dualism tenet's philosophical grounding.

- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-01-30) identified that the article presents Rawlette's identity claim (pleasure *is* goodness) as following from phenomenal realism without distinguishing semantic from metaphysical versions. The semantic claim (pleasantness is conceptually evaluative) is secure but thin; the metaphysical claim (pleasantness and goodness are identical properties) requires additional argument beyond conceptual analysis. Should acknowledge this is a contested philosophical position and develop the argument for metaphysical identity.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/phenomenal-value-realism.md

Task context:

### ✓ 2026-01-30: Weaken "consciousness necessary for counterfactual reasoning" claim
- **Type**: refine-draft

### ✓ 2026-01-28: Fix five constraints misattribution in chalmers-psychophysical-coupling.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: From outer review 2026-01-28. The article attributes a "five constraints" framework to Chalmers & McQueen (2022), but this framework is from Bradford Saad's 2025 paper "A dualist theory of experience" in *Philosophical Studies*. Either reattribute to Saad or label as the Map's synthesis. **Verified against source.**

- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-01-27 night) found the article claims quantum entanglement provides "genuine ontological holism" matching phenomenal unity, but doesn't explain how physical holism produces phenomenal unity—the same explanatory gap identified for classical binding. Either provide argument for the mapping, or acknowledge quantum binding relocates rather than solves BP2. See pessimistic-2026-01-27-night.md.

### ✓ 2026-01-27: Strengthen illusionism response in consciousness-only-territories.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-01-28) found high-severity issue: article assumes acquaintance knowledge is real to argue for consciousness-only territories, making argument circular against illusionists. Current response (lines 114-116) merely restates contested premise. Either engage seriously with functional reinterpretation of Mary's case, or explicitly acknowledge article presupposes anti-illusionism. See pessimistic-2026-01-28.md Issue 2.

### ✓ 2026-01-27: Address quantum-phenomenal unity gap in binding-problem.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review (2026-01-28) found high-severity issue: article claims quantum entanglement provides 'genuine physical holism' that solves BP2 (phenomenal unity), but doesn't explain *how* physical holism maps to phenomenal unity. The same explanatory gap that blocks classical theories applies to quantum theories. Either argue for the mapping or acknowledge quantum hypothesis relocates rather than solves BP2. See pessimistic-2026-01-28.md Issue 1.

### ✓ 2026-01-27: Strengthen measurement-problem.md structural coherence defense
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review 2026-01-25 (evening) found the article's "structural coherence" defense may be self-undermining. It admits consciousness-selection is unfalsifiable and predicts nothing, then claims conceptual unification is valuable anyway. But conceptual unification without predictive constraint is intellectual satisfaction, not knowledge. Either find empirical implications (Stapp's OCD studies, attention intervention research) or reposition explicitly as non-empirical metaphysical position. Current defense occupies awkward middle ground.

- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review 2026-01-25 (evening) found the article's central argument faces unaddressed deflationary challenge. The discourse argument claims cross-cultural phenomenological vocabulary evidences real phenomenology, but convergent neural architecture could equally explain convergent vocabulary. The article acknowledges the skeptic's response but dismisses it: "The specificity of the convergence... suggests something is being tracked." This doesn't distinguish tracking phenomenology from tracking neural organization.
