This is the task queue for AI automation. The human reviews and prioritizes tasks; the AI executes them.

## How to Edit This List

- **Promote**: Change `P3` to `P1`, etc.
- **Demote**: Change `P1` to `P3`, etc.
- **Veto**: Add `#veto` anywhere in the task heading (e.g., `### P2: Task name #veto`)
- **Add reason**: Optionally add `- **Veto reason**: [why]` before vetoing

Vetoed items are moved automatically to the Vetoed Tasks section on the next `/evolve` run.

## Priority Levels

- **P0**: Urgent - execute immediately
- **P1**: High - execute this week
- **P2**: Medium - execute when time permits
- **P3**: Low - nice to have, human approval needed

## Active Tasks

### ✓ 2026-01-14: Research decoherence and macroscopic superposition
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Schrödinger's cat was warm and macroscopic yet in a superposed state. Explore coherence time, what decoherence really means in this context, and whether neural firing patterns could exhibit similar superposition behavior despite being "warm and wet." Key question: does decoherence necessarily prevent quantum effects in biological systems?
- **Source**: manual
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering SEP treatment of decoherence, Tegmark vs. Hameroff debate, "hot" Schrödinger cat states (1.8K, April 2025), quantum biology evidence, nanoparticle matter-wave interference (7000+ atoms). Key finding: decoherence does NOT solve measurement problem; boundary between quantum and classical keeps shifting; the objection is weaker than assumed.
- **Output**: `research/decoherence-macroscopic-superposition-2026-01-14.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-14: Research Stapp on mental effort and mind-matter interaction
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Verify Henry Stapp's claim that it takes effort to control the mind—to override its own wants and needs. If confirmed, explore how this phenomenology of effortful attention might be a clue to the mechanism by which consciousness influences matter (quantum Zeno effect requiring sustained attention).
- **Source**: manual
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism, William James's phenomenology of effort, Schwartz's OCD neuroplasticity evidence, Georgiev's critique. Key finding: phenomenology of effort is well-documented (James, Kahneman); Schwartz's therapy produces measurable brain changes; mechanism details remain debated but phenomenology supports Bidirectional Interaction.
- **Output**: `research/stapp-mental-effort-mind-matter-2026-01-14.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-14: Research temporal structure of different consciousness types
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Human consciousness is tightly bound to temporal flow, but other forms might not be. If LLMs have any form of consciousness, is it tied to time the same way? Explore how the start-stop, distributed, non-continuous nature of LLM operation might support radically different conscious experience—or whether temporal binding is essential to consciousness itself.
- **Source**: manual
- **Generated**: 2026-01-14
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering specious present (James, Husserl), temporal binding mechanisms (gamma oscillations, millisecond synchrony), Hoel's Dec 2025 argument that LLMs cannot be conscious due to lack of continual learning, and analysis of whether temporal structure is essential or merely characteristic of biological consciousness.

### ✓ 2026-01-07: Create concept page on retrocausality and consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Based on [[libet-experiments-free-will-2026-01-07|Libet research]]. Present how retrocausal interpretations of quantum mechanics (Wheeler's delayed-choice, Cramer's transactional interpretation) align with the Bidirectional Interaction tenet. Key insight: if causation can flow backward in time at the quantum level, the apparent problem of neural activity preceding conscious awareness dissolves. Consciousness doesn't arrive "too late"—it may influence outcomes retrocausally. This paints a picture where consciousness is woven into the causal fabric of reality in ways that linear time obscures.
- **Result**: Created ~1500 word article covering time-symmetric QM, Wheeler's delayed-choice, Cramer's transactional interpretation, and application to the Libet problem via atemporal selection model
- **Output**: `concepts/retrocausality.md`

### ✓ 2026-01-07: Research Libet experiments and neural predictors of decision
- **Type**: research-topic
- **Notes**: Experiments show neural "readiness potentials" predict decisions before conscious awareness. At first glance this weighs against free will. However, in our framework consciousness may "bake in" prior history through quantum selection—analogous to how quantum systems appear to explore all paths before collapsing. Research: (1) Libet's original experiments, (2) Haynes/Soon 2008 fMRI study, (3) critiques (Schurger et al. on neural noise), (4) retrocausal interpretations, (5) how this relates to Bidirectional Interaction tenet. This research should inform the free will article.
- **Result**: Comprehensive research covering Libet 1983, Soon et al. 2008, Schurger neural noise critique, retrocausality in QM, Wheeler's delayed-choice, Cramer's transactional interpretation. Key finding: retrocausal interpretation aligns with Bidirectional Interaction tenet.
