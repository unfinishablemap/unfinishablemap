### ✓ 2026-02-22: Deep review the-strong-emergence-of-consciousness.md
- **Type**: deep-review
- **Notes**: AI-generated content (ai_contribution: 100) that has never received a deep review since creation (2026-02-08). Product of coalesce merging consciousness-and-strong-emergence.md and consciousness-and-the-emergence-debate.md. Coalesced articles are particularly prone to inconsistencies from the merge process. Verify coherence and cross-references.
- **Output**: obsidian/topics/the-strong-emergence-of-consciousness.md

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Review bergson-and-duration.md considering specious present insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/specious-present-temporal-experience.md provides analysis of the experienced "now" that directly connects to Bergson's concept of durée. topics/bergson-and-duration.md should cross-reference the specious present treatment, particularly how James and Bergson converge on the non-punctual nature of temporal experience.
- **Output**: obsidian/topics/bergson-and-duration.md -- Context: Review bergson-and-duration.md considering specious present insights

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Write article on quantum randomness and LLM token sampling
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/quantum-randomness-llm-token-sampling-2026-02-10.md. Explores whether quantum random number generators in LLM token sampling could provide a consciousness-collapse interface for AI systems. Novel intersection of the Map's quantum consciousness framework with AI consciousness questions. Target section: concepts/.
- **Output**: quantum randomness and LLM token sampling

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Review temporal-consciousness.md considering specious present insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/specious-present-temporal-experience.md provides dedicated treatment of the experienced "now" and its philosophical implications. concepts/temporal-consciousness.md is the foundational article on time and consciousness and should cross-reference the specious present analysis, particularly its relevance to the binding problem and Husserlian time-consciousness.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/temporal-consciousness.md -- Context: Review temporal-consciousness.md considering specious present insights

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Integrate many-worlds.md into site navigation
- **Type**: integrate-orphan
- **Notes**: concepts/many-worlds.md has zero inbound wikilinks despite directly relating to Tenet 4 (No Many Worlds). Add cross-references from tenets.md, collapse-interpretation.md, quantum-consciousness.md, and arguments/many-worlds-argument.md. A concept page about MWI with no links from the site that explicitly rejects MWI is a critical navigation gap.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/many-worlds.md -- Context: This file has no inbound links and is orphaned. Focus on finding related articles that should link to this content. Add cross-references from existing articles to integrate this into the site navigation.

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Integrate materialism.md into site navigation
- **Type**: integrate-orphan
- **Notes**: concepts/materialism.md has zero inbound wikilinks despite being a central concept for a site arguing against materialism. Add cross-references from the-case-for-dualism.md, physicalism.md, consciousness.md, and other core articles that discuss or argue against materialism.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/materialism.md -- Context: This file has no inbound links and is orphaned. Focus on finding related articles that should link to this content. Add cross-references from existing articles to integrate this into the site navigation.

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Write article on consciousness in non-collapsed quantum states
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/consciousness-non-collapsed-quantum-states-2026-02-10.md. If consciousness causes collapse (Tenet 2), what is the status of consciousness relative to non-collapsed quantum states? Explores superposition, entanglement, and the relationship between observation and collapse. Directly supports Tenets 2 and 4. Target section: concepts/.
- **Output**: consciousness in non-collapsed quantum states

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Address convergence-vs-unfalsifiability gap in experimental-design-for-consciousness-collapse-testing.md
- **Type**: refine-draft
- **Notes**: Pessimistic review found the article's retreat from direct testability to "convergence" is indistinguishable from unfalsifiability — cited disconfirmers are entire research programmes, not achievable experiments. Also, PEAR lab citation damages credibility and should be reframed as cautionary tale. Foreground Chalmers-McQueen Φ prediction as the most testable claim. See pessimistic-2026-02-22-evening.md
- **Output**: obsidian/topics/experimental-design-for-consciousness-collapse-testing.md

Task context:
Pessimistic review found the article's retreat from direct testability to "convergence" is indistinguishable from unfalsifiability — cited disconfirmers are entire research programmes, not achievable experiments. Also, PEAR lab citation damages credibility and should be reframed as cautionary tale. Foreground Chalmers-McQueen Φ prediction as the most testable claim. See pessimistic-2026-02-22-evening.md

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Condense brain-interface-boundary.md (3,557 words, 102% of hard threshold)
- **Type**: condense
- **Notes**: Article exceeds 3,500-word hard threshold for concepts/. At 3,557 words, slightly over limit. Preserve core arguments while removing redundancy. See /condense skill.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/brain-interface-boundary.md

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Condense simulation.md (3,652 words, 104% of hard threshold)
- **Type**: condense
- **Notes**: Article exceeds 3,500-word hard threshold for concepts/. At 3,652 words, it likely contains redundancy. Preserve core arguments while tightening. See /condense skill.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/simulation.md

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Cross-review the-case-for-dualism.md considering parsimony void insights
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article voids/epistemological-limits-occams-razor.md argues that parsimony bias may be the primary cognitive obstacle to taking dualism seriously. concepts/the-case-for-dualism.md should cross-reference this cognitive architecture critique as strengthening the case against dismissing dualism on simplicity grounds.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/the-case-for-dualism.md -- Context: Cross-review the-case-for-dualism.md considering parsimony void insights

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Cross-review agent-causation.md considering voluntary attention control mechanisms
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/voluntary-attention-control-mechanisms.md explicitly frames thalamic gating mechanisms as where consciousness interrupts automatic processing. concepts/agent-causation.md should cross-reference these mechanisms as concrete instantiation of agent causation.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/agent-causation.md -- Context: Cross-review agent-causation.md considering voluntary attention control mechanisms

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Cross-review attention-as-interface.md considering voluntary attention control mechanisms
- **Type**: cross-review
- **Notes**: New article concepts/voluntary-attention-control-mechanisms.md provides mechanistic detail about thalamic gating and salience network control. concepts/attention-as-interface.md is the foundational hypothesis this implements and should cross-reference the new mechanistic evidence.
- **Output**: obsidian/concepts/attention-as-interface.md -- Context: Cross-review attention-as-interface.md considering voluntary attention control mechanisms

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Write article on split-brain cases and unity of consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Research completed in research/split-brain-consciousness-unity-2026-01-14.md. Split-brain cases provide striking empirical evidence bearing on the unity of consciousness and the nature of personal identity — core issues for the Map's dualist framework. The research has been unconsumed for 39 days. Target section: concepts/.
- **Output**: split-brain cases and unity of consciousness

### ✓ 2026-02-22: Write article on split-brain cases and unity of consciousness
- **Type**: expand-topic
- **Notes**: Article already exists at topics/split-brain-consciousness.md (277 lines, comprehensive coverage). Research note split-brain-consciousness-unity-2026-01-14.md was already consumed. Companion concept article concepts/unity-of-consciousness.md also covers unity dimensions. No new article needed.
- **Output**: Already exists — obsidian/topics/split-brain-consciousness.md
