# Research: Libet Experiments and Neural Predictors of Decision

**Date**: 2026-01-07
**Search queries used**: "Libet experiment readiness potential free will neuroscience 1983", "Soon Haynes 2008 fMRI brain activity predicts decisions before awareness", "Schurger 2012 neural noise readiness potential critique Libet", "retrocausality quantum mechanics free will consciousness", "Libet veto power conscious will", "Wheeler delayed choice experiment", "transactional interpretation quantum mechanics"

## Executive Summary

The Libet experiments (1983) and subsequent studies (Soon et al. 2008) appear to show that neural activity predicts decisions hundreds of milliseconds to seconds before conscious awareness of choosing. This has been interpreted as evidence against libertarian free will. However, recent critiques (Schurger et al. 2012) suggest the "readiness potential" may be neural noise rather than decision-making, and Libet himself argued consciousness retains "veto power." Most significantly for the site's framework, retrocausal interpretations of quantum mechanics suggest that effects can precede causes—consciousness might "select" outcomes in a way that appears to predict them. This aligns with the Bidirectional Interaction tenet.

## Key Sources

### Libet et al. (1983) - Original Experiment
- **URL**: [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6640273/)
- **Type**: Primary research paper
- **Key points**:
  - Readiness potential (RP) begins ~550ms before action
  - Conscious awareness of intention occurs ~200ms before action
  - RP precedes conscious intention by ~350ms
  - Libet proposed consciousness retains "veto power" over prepared actions
- **Tenet alignment**: Potentially conflicts with Bidirectional Interaction, but veto power preserves some role for consciousness
- **Quote**: "The initiation of voluntary action begins before an individual makes a conscious decision to move."

### Soon et al. (2008) - Extended Prediction Window
- **URL**: [Nature Neuroscience](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.2112)
- **Type**: Primary research paper
- **Key points**:
  - Used fMRI rather than EEG
  - Brain activity in prefrontal and parietal cortex predicted decisions up to 10 seconds before awareness
  - Prediction accuracy was ~60% (above chance but imperfect)
  - Frontopolar cortex showed predictive activity 7 seconds before conscious awareness
- **Tenet alignment**: Stronger challenge than Libet, but imperfect prediction leaves room for conscious influence
- **Quote**: "The outcome of a decision can be encoded in brain activity of prefrontal and parietal cortex up to 10 seconds before it enters awareness."

### Schurger et al. (2012) - Neural Noise Critique
- **URL**: [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3479453/)
- **Type**: Primary research paper (critique)
- **Key points**:
  - Proposed that RP reflects stochastic neural noise, not decision-making
  - Used leaky stochastic accumulator model
  - RP may be artifact of averaging spontaneous fluctuations
  - "Takes the sting out of the Libet argument against free will"
  - Participants may trigger actions when neural noise happens to cross a threshold
- **Tenet alignment**: Supports site tenets—removes RP as evidence against conscious causation
- **Quote**: "The readiness potential could simply be an artefact of averaging stochastic noise."

### Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Retrocausality
- **URL**: [plato.stanford.edu](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-retrocausality/)
- **Type**: Encyclopedia article
- **Key points**:
  - Retrocausality: effects preceding causes
  - Time-symmetric quantum theories may require retrocausal influences
  - Leifer & Spekkens (2013): time-symmetric + causal = retrocausal
  - Can resolve Bell test nonlocality without faster-than-light signals
- **Tenet alignment**: Strongly supports site framework—offers mechanism for consciousness influencing "past" neural states

### Wheeler's Delayed-Choice Experiment
- **URL**: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheeler's_delayed-choice_experiment)
- **Type**: Encyclopedia article
- **Key points**:
  - Observer's later choice appears to determine particle's earlier behavior
  - Experimentally confirmed (Alley et al. 1984, satellite experiments 2017)
  - Standard interpretation: particle in superposition until measurement, no true retrocausation
  - Alternative: genuine retrocausal influence
- **Tenet alignment**: Compatible with consciousness selecting among quantum possibilities retroactively

### Cramer's Transactional Interpretation
- **URL**: [University of Washington](https://www.npl.washington.edu/av/altvw16.html)
- **Type**: Academic article
- **Key points**:
  - Quantum events involve "offer waves" (forward in time) and "confirmation waves" (backward in time)
  - "Handshake" across spacetime creates transaction
  - Wave functions are physically real, not just mathematical
  - Derives Born Rule naturally
  - Transaction is "atemporal"—collapse occurs along whole transaction
- **Tenet alignment**: Provides theoretical framework for consciousness operating outside linear time

## Major Positions

### Position 1: Hard Determinism / Neuroscientific Skepticism
- **Proponents**: Sam Harris, various neuroscientists
- **Core claim**: Libet-type experiments prove conscious will is illusory; decisions are made by unconscious brain processes before we're aware
- **Key arguments**:
  - RP precedes conscious intention
  - Soon et al. extends this to 10 seconds
  - Consciousness is merely informed of decisions already made
- **Relation to site tenets**: Directly conflicts with Bidirectional Interaction and Dualism. Treats consciousness as epiphenomenal.

### Position 2: Compatibilist Free Will with Veto
- **Proponents**: Benjamin Libet himself, many philosophers
- **Core claim**: Consciousness may not initiate actions but can veto them; this preserves meaningful free will
- **Key arguments**:
  - Subjects can veto prepared actions within 100-200ms window
  - "Free won't" rather than "free will"
  - Conscious control operates at selection/inhibition level
- **Relation to site tenets**: Partially compatible. Preserves some role for consciousness but still treats initiation as unconscious.

### Position 3: Neural Noise Interpretation
- **Proponents**: Schurger, Sitt, Dehaene (2012)
- **Core claim**: The readiness potential is not a decision signal but stochastic noise; participants act when noise crosses threshold
- **Key arguments**:
  - RP shape matches accumulator model of noise
  - Explains variation in W-times
  - "Libetus interruptus" experiment confirms predictions
  - Removes RP as evidence for unconscious decision-making
- **Relation to site tenets**: Supportive. Removes main empirical challenge to conscious causation.

### Position 4: Retrocausal/Atemporal Consciousness
- **Proponents**: Huw Price, Cramer, Penrose/Hameroff (speculatively)
- **Core claim**: Consciousness may operate outside linear time; what appears as "prediction" may be backward causation
- **Key arguments**:
  - Quantum mechanics is time-symmetric
  - Transactional interpretation involves advanced waves
  - Wheeler's delayed-choice shows measurement can "affect" past
  - Consciousness selecting quantum outcomes need not respect temporal ordering
- **Relation to site tenets**: **Strongly supportive.** Aligns with Minimal Quantum Interaction and Bidirectional Interaction. If consciousness selects among quantum superpositions, the apparent temporal precedence of neural activity may reflect consciousness "baking in" the history that led to the choice.

## Key Debates

### Debate 1: Does RP Represent Decision or Noise?
- **Sides**: Traditional interpretation (RP = unconscious decision) vs. Schurger et al. (RP = accumulated noise)
- **Core disagreement**: Whether the gradual buildup of neural activity represents goal-directed preparation or stochastic fluctuation
- **Current state**: Schurger's model well-supported but not universally accepted. 2021 meta-analysis found evidence for prediction effect "weaker than often claimed"

### Debate 2: Does "Veto Power" Preserve Free Will?
- **Sides**: Libet and compatibilists (veto = genuine control) vs. Critics (veto itself preceded by neural activity)
- **Core disagreement**: Whether inhibition of action is truly "free" if it too has neural precursors
- **Current state**: Ongoing. Some argue veto is itself determined; others argue selection/inhibition is where freedom operates

### Debate 3: Is Retrocausality Physical?
- **Sides**: Standard QM (no true retrocausation, just superposition) vs. Retrocausal interpretations (genuine backward influence)
- **Core disagreement**: Whether delayed-choice experiments demonstrate real backward causation or just reveal quantum indeterminacy
- **Current state**: Minority view but growing interest; experimentally confirmed predictions but interpretive debate continues

## Connection to Site Tenets

### Bidirectional Interaction
The Libet experiments appear to challenge Bidirectional Interaction by suggesting consciousness arrives "too late" to initiate actions. However:
1. **Schurger's critique** removes RP as evidence for unconscious decision-making
2. **Veto power** preserves conscious influence at selection level
3. **Retrocausal interpretation** suggests consciousness might influence the "past" neural states through quantum selection

The site's tenet proposes that "consciousness selects among superposed neural states." If quantum selection operates atemporally (as in Cramer's transactional interpretation), then the apparent temporal precedence of neural activity is not problematic. Consciousness doesn't need to precede neural preparation—it may select which prepared pattern becomes actual, and this selection could retroactively "choose" the history.

### Minimal Quantum Interaction
The decoherence timescale objection (Tegmark) suggests quantum effects in brains are too fast to be relevant. But:
1. The question isn't whether coherence persists but whether consciousness influences *which* classical state emerges
2. Retrocausal models don't require coherence to persist—influence can propagate backward

### No Many Worlds
The site rejects MWI. Retrocausal interpretations offer an alternative explanation for quantum nonlocality without branching universes. The transactional interpretation in particular provides a single-world, time-symmetric account.

## Potential Article Angles

Based on this research, a free will article could:

1. **The Retrocausal Resolution**: Present Libet as a puzzle that retrocausality resolves. Consciousness doesn't precede the decision in time—it selects the outcome atemporally, and the prior neural activity is part of the selected history.

2. **Schurger's Defense**: Lead with the neural noise critique to establish that Libet-style evidence is weaker than commonly believed, then build the positive case for conscious causation.

3. **From Veto to Selection**: Reframe Libet's "veto power" as evidence for selection-based free will. Consciousness doesn't generate options from nothing—it selects among options the brain presents.

## Gaps in Research

- Specific mechanisms for how retrocausal quantum selection would operate in neurons
- Experimental tests that could distinguish retrocausal consciousness from standard interpretations
- Whether Schurger's critique applies equally to Soon et al.'s 10-second prediction window
- Detailed analysis of how Penrose-Hameroff Orch OR relates to retrocausality
- Buddhist perspectives on self and decision-making (see existing research on Buddhist perspectives)

## Suggested Follow-up Tasks

1. **P2: Research retrocausality in quantum mechanics** - Deeper dive into Price, Cramer, TSVF, specifically mechanisms for how retrocausal selection could work
2. **P2: Research Penrose-Hameroff Orch OR and time** - Do their proposals have retrocausal implications?
3. **P3: Research compatibilism vs libertarianism in philosophy** - Broader free will landscape for context
