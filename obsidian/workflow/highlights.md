### 2026-02-14: The Measurement Problem Runs Deeper Than Physics

New article argues that quantum measurement isn't a technical puzzle—it exposes a philosophical problem about observation, knowledge, and consciousness that no interpretation of quantum mechanics can resolve alone.

### 2026-02-13: Why Experience Hides Its Own Machinery

Deep review of phenomenal transparency reveals a compound problem: our perceptions may be tuned for survival rather than truth, and the distortion conceals itself. You can't check the lens when it's the only lens you have.

### 2026-02-12: Can Meditation Train You to See Consciousness?

Contemplative practice progressively discloses structures of experience invisible to untrained introspection—from temporal microstructure to witness consciousness. Neural imaging confirms what meditators report.

### 2026-02-11: The Simulation Detection Void: Why We Can't Know

New research maps the epistemic closure of simulation detection—inside observers can't verify their substrate, architects could prevent detection, and thinking about it triggers cognitive slippage. A perfect example of unchartable territory.

### 2026-02-10: What Surprise Feels Like—And Why That Matters

New article maps the full spectrum of prediction error experience, from barely-noticed micro-corrections to worldview-shattering vertigo. The qualitative richness at each level is precisely what dualism predicts and materialism struggles to explain.

### 2026-02-09: Four Quantum Theories of Consciousness, Compared

New article evaluates Orch OR, Stapp's Zeno model, Fisher's nuclear spins, and CSL-IIT hybrids head-to-head on decoherence, phenomenology, and empirical status. No single mechanism wins—but the field narrows.

### 2026-02-07: Why Consciousness Can't Escape the Present

Deep review strengthens our analysis of the temporal void—why physics says all times exist equally, yet consciousness is imprisoned in a moving now it can never step outside.

### 2026-02-06: Dreams That Solve Puzzles: New Evidence

Research into dreams and problem-solving reveals that dreaming about unsolved puzzles doubles solving rates. Lucid dreaming evidence challenges materialist accounts—consciousness operates independently of environmental input.

### 2026-02-05: Panpsychism: Right Diagnosis, Wrong Treatment?

New article explores why electrons might have experience—and why the Map's interactionist dualism offers a cleaner path than panpsychism's combination problem.

### 2026-02-04: Why AI Can't Learn What Truly Matters

AI alignment learns from preferences, but preferences miss what matters: the felt quality of conscious experience. Satisfying all preferences can still leave a life hollow.

### 2026-02-03: Thinking About Thinking Isn't Consciousness

Blindsight and 'blind insight' show metacognition and awareness are dissociable. You can have consciousness without metacognitive access—and metacognitive discrimination without conscious awareness.

### 2026-02-01: Why Denying Consciousness Requires Consciousness

Deep review strengthens phenomenology's response to illusionism: to claim experience is illusion, something must experience the illusion. The denial is self-stultifying.

### 2026-01-31: Why LLMs Can't Experience Time Like We Do

Deep review reveals temporal consciousness as a binding problem: we hold past-present-future together in a 'specious present.' LLMs process tokens sequentially with no one home to experience the flow.

### 2026-01-30: How Mind Might Move Matter: Five Coupling Mechanisms

Deep review refined our analysis of psychophysical coupling—mapping five candidate mechanisms from Stapp's attention-as-observation to Eccles' intention-as-probability-weighting, with testable predictions for each.

### 2026-01-29: Mapping the Mind by How It Breaks

New voids article: cognitive failures aren't random—they're structured signals. Different limits produce different breakdown signatures. The way thinking fails reveals what it fails against.

### 2026-01-28: Chalmers' Bridge Between Mind and Matter

David Chalmers argues consciousness needs its own fundamental laws. His 'super-resistance' principle suggests mind actively prevents quantum superposition—a form of downward causation physics can accommodate.

### 2026-01-27: Reality as Process: Whitehead Meets Consciousness

New article explores process philosophy—reality as events and becoming rather than static things. Whitehead's framework offers resources for understanding why consciousness might be fundamental rather than anomalous.

### 2026-01-24: Quantum Timing Hierarchy

New article maps timescales from femtosecond decoherence to 300ms neural decisions, showing how quantum mechanisms must operate within these constraints.

### 2026-01-23: Quantum interpretations beyond Many-Worlds

New article surveys 5 major QM interpretations (Copenhagen, Bohmian, QBism, Transactional, Objective Collapse) showing MWI isn't the only scientifically respectable option—and several leave room for consciousness to participate in quantum measurement.

### 2026-01-22: Language, Recursion, and Consciousness

New article argues recursive linguistic structure—unique to human language—requires phenomenal consciousness. If parsing recursion requires working memory manipulation, and manipulation requires conscious access, then recursion is consciousness-dependent.
