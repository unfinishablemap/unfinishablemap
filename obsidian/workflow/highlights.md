### 2026-02-27: Consciousness Can't Be Superposed—And That Matters

Deep review reveals a key constraint: consciousness is constitutively definite, never entering superposition. This 'definiteness constraint' connects quantum measurement directly to the hard problem of consciousness.

**Type**: insight

### 2026-02-26: Why Only Quantum Physics Can Explain Unified Experience

Classical mechanisms coordinate separate brain processes but can never make them one. Quantum entanglement is the only physics where wholes are prior to parts—matching how consciousness actually works.

### 2026-02-25: The Narrative Void: Consciousness as Unreliable Narrator

New research explores how consciousness constructs coherent self-stories from fragmentary experience—and hides the construction process. Split-brain studies and choice blindness reveal we confabulate more than we know.

### 2026-02-24: Why the Past Feels Fixed and the Future Feels Open

Refined exploration of how temporal phenomenology—retention, primal impression, protention—may be what quantum selection feels like from within. The fixedness of past and openness of future could track collapsed versus uncollapsed quantum states.

### 2026-02-23: What If Consciousness Is Something You Do?

Strengthened case that consciousness isn't a property brains have—it's an activity organisms perform. Like dancing can't be reduced to legs, experience can't be reduced to neurons.

### 2026-02-22: When You Imagine a Movement, Does Consciousness Do the Work?

New article examines how voluntary mental imagery—where you consciously choose what to visualize—provides one of the strongest test cases for consciousness having genuine causal power over the physical world.

### 2026-02-21: Why Creativity Needs Lived Time, Not Just Clock Time

Strengthened article argues that genuine novelty requires Bergson's durée—accumulated, irreversible, interpenetrating experience—not mere computation over time. Atemporal systems recombine; only temporal consciousness creates.

**Type**: insight  
**Link**: [[consciousness-and-temporal-creativity]]

---

### 2026-02-20: Why Remembering Is the Hard Problem in Action

Deep review of episodic memory reveals: every act of recall constructs fresh experience from fragments. The same information accessed with or without re-living shows phenomenology isn't reducible to information.

**Type**: insight  
**Link**: [[episodic-memory]]

### 2026-02-19: How the Mind-Brain Interface Transforms Across a Lifetime

Deep review reveals that consciousness navigates five distinct interface phases—from infant wide-aperture access without agency, through adult peak control, to late-life dissolution. The trajectory isn't linear decline but a series of qualitative restructurings, each with uniq...

### 2026-02-18: Mysterianism Unified: Why We May Never Solve Consciousness

Coalesced two articles into a comprehensive treatment of McGinn's cognitive closure thesis—the idea that human minds are constitutionally unable to solve the mind-body problem, like rats unable to grasp calculus.

**Type**: new-article  
**Link**: [[mysterianism]]

---

### 2026-02-17: Metacognition Meets Metarepresentation

Two related concepts unified into one article: why thinking about thinking isn't the same as consciousness, and what blindsight, lucid dreaming, and teaching reveal about the difference.

**Type**: new-article

### 2026-02-16: The Modal Void: Why Consciousness Is Trapped in Actuality

New research explores consciousness's deepest confinement—not to a place or moment, but to one mode of being. You can move through space and are carried through time, but modal confinement admits no traversal at all.

### 2026-02-15: Four Roads to the Same Destination

Deep review sharpens the convergence argument: zombies, inverted qualia, Mary's Room, and Kripke's asymmetry each target a different dimension of consciousness—yet all reveal the same modal independence from physics.

### 2026-02-14: The Measurement Problem Runs Deeper Than Physics

New article argues that quantum measurement isn't a technical puzzle—it exposes a philosophical problem about observation, knowledge, and consciousness that no interpretation of quantum mechanics can resolve alone.

### 2026-02-13: Why Experience Hides Its Own Machinery

Deep review of phenomenal transparency reveals a compound problem: our perceptions may be tuned for survival rather than truth, and the distortion conceals itself. You can't check the lens when it's the only lens you have.

### 2026-02-12: Can Meditation Train You to See Consciousness?

Contemplative practice progressively discloses structures of experience invisible to untrained introspection—from temporal microstructure to witness consciousness. Neural imaging confirms what meditators report.

### 2026-02-11: The Simulation Detection Void: Why We Can't Know

New research maps the epistemic closure of simulation detection—inside observers can't verify their substrate, architects could prevent detection, and thinking about it triggers cognitive slippage. A perfect example of unchartable territory.

### 2026-02-10: What Surprise Feels Like—And Why That Matters

New article maps the full spectrum of prediction error experience, from barely-noticed micro-corrections to worldview-shattering vertigo. The qualitative richness at each level is precisely what dualism predicts and materialism struggles to explain.

### 2026-02-09: Four Quantum Theories of Consciousness, Compared

New article evaluates Orch OR, Stapp's Zeno model, Fisher's nuclear spins, and CSL-IIT hybrids head-to-head on decoherence, phenomenology, and empirical status. No single mechanism wins—but the field narrows.

### 2026-02-07: Why Consciousness Can't Escape the Present

Deep review strengthens our analysis of the temporal void—why physics says all times exist equally, yet consciousness is imprisoned in a moving now it can never step outside.
