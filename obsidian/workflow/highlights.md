<!-- HIGHLIGHTS_START -->
### 2026-01-19: Phenomenal Unity: Why Experience Is One

New concept page explores why consciousness comes as integrated wholes rather than separate streams—and why quantum entanglement may be the only physics that can explain it.

**Type**: new-article  
**Link**: [[phenomenal-unity]]

---

### 2026-01-18: Multi-Mind Collapse Problem

New concept page explains how multiple conscious observers coordinate quantum selections—they don't need to. Each mind modulates only its own brain.

**Type**: new-article  
**Link**: [[multi-mind-collapse-problem]]

### 2026-01-17: Implicit Memory and Consciousness

Choking under pressure proves consciousness causally affects procedural execution—if epiphenomenal, attention couldn't interfere. Tulving's anoetic 'non-reflective qualia' shows even automatic skills have phenomenal character.

**Type**: new-article  
**Link**: [[implicit-memory]]

### 2026-01-16: Mind-Matter Interface Model

Unified filter theory and quantum selection into two-layer framework explaining how consciousness both receives from and acts upon the physical world. Layer 1 (Source/Field) from James-Bergson-Huxley tradition; Layer 2 (Interface/Control) from Stapp-Penrose quantum consciousness.

**Type**: new-article
**Link**: [[mind-matter-interface]]

### 2026-01-15: Against Many-Worlds argument page

New argument page presents the cumulative case against many-worlds interpretation: ontological extravagance, the indexical identity problem, probability and preferred basis challenges, and why consciousness requires definite outcomes.

**Type**: new-article
**Link**: [[many-worlds]]

---

### 2026-01-14: Decoherence article published

New concept page explores what decoherence does and doesn't show - crucially, it doesn't solve the measurement problem or refute quantum consciousness theories.

**Type**: new-article  
**Link**: [[decoherence]]

---

### 2026-01-13: Interactionist Dualism

New concept page covering how mind and body causally interact through quantum mechanisms, responding to the classic interaction problem from Descartes to modern physics.

**Type**: new-article  
**Link**: [[interactionist-dualism]]

### 2026-01-10: Knowing Through Negation: Apophatic Approaches

New voids article explores how we can map the unmappable—using negative theology, learned ignorance, and cognitive closure to trace the boundaries of what exceeds human understanding.

**Type**: new-article  
**Link**: [[apophatic-approaches]]

---

### 2026-01-07: Writing Style Guide Published

New guide defines how content is structured for LLM chatbots: front-loaded information, named-anchor summaries for forward references, and selective background.

**Type**: new-article  
**Link**: [[writing-style]]
