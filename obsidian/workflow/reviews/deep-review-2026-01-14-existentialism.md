# Deep Review: Existentialism

**Date**: 2026-01-14
**File**: obsidian/concepts/existentialism.md
**Previous review**: Never

## Pessimistic Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues Found
None critical—the article was competent but incomplete in its tenet engagement.

### Medium Issues Found
1. **Missing No Many Worlds connection**: The article discussed freedom and choice but never connected to the No Many Worlds tenet, which is directly relevant—existentialist authentic choice presupposes that choices genuinely select outcomes rather than actualizing all branches.
   - **Resolution**: Added new "Authentic choice in one world" paragraph explaining how MWI rejection preserves existentialist freedom.

2. **Sartre's position overcharacterized as dualist**: Original text implied Sartre's pour-soi/en-soi distinction supports substance dualism.
   - **Resolution**: Clarified that Sartre did not endorse substance dualism while noting the phenomenological alignment.

3. **Missing Eastern philosophy comparison**: Both nihilism.md and meaning-of-life.md include Buddhist perspectives; existentialism.md was missing this comparison despite obvious relevance (no-self vs. self-creation).
   - **Resolution**: Added full "Comparison with Eastern Philosophy" section covering anattā, responses to groundlessness, and site's integration.

4. **Missing cross-links**: No connections to free-will.md or personal-identity.md despite obvious thematic overlap.
   - **Resolution**: Added frontmatter topics/concepts and paragraph connecting to personal identity and free will discussions.

### Counterarguments Considered
- **Buddhist challenge**: Existentialist self-creation may itself be a form of clinging—addressed in new Eastern philosophy section.
- **Sartre's materialism**: Acknowledged that Sartre's overall metaphysics remained materialist despite phenomenological distinctions.

## Optimistic Analysis Summary

### Strengths Preserved
- Clear, accessible explanations of core existentialist concepts (existence precedes essence, radical freedom, authenticity, absurdity, bad faith)
- Good historical coverage of key thinkers and works
- Honest acknowledgment of tensions between existentialism and site framework
- Strong references section

### Enhancements Made
1. **No Many Worlds connection**: New paragraph explaining how rejection of MWI preserves existentialist freedom
2. **Eastern philosophy section**: Full comparison with Buddhist no-self doctrine
3. **Personal identity connection**: Linked authentic existence to site's treatment of unrepeatable consciousness
4. **Free will connection**: Linked existentialist freedom to quantum indeterminacy mechanism
5. **Clarified Sartre's position**: More accurate characterization of his relationship to dualism
6. **Expanded Further Reading**: Added meaning-of-life, free-will, personal-identity, eastern-philosophy-consciousness

### Cross-links Added
- [[free-will]] (topics)
- [[meaning-of-life]] (topics)
- [[personal-identity]] (concepts)
- [[eastern-philosophy-consciousness]] (related articles, Further Reading)

## Changes Summary

The article grew from ~1200 words to ~1800 words. Key additions:
- "Authentic choice in one world" paragraph connecting to No Many Worlds tenet
- "Free will and Personal Identity" paragraph connecting to related site content
- Full "Comparison with Eastern Philosophy" section (~350 words)
- Clarified Sartre's actual metaphysical position
- Expanded Further Reading from 2 to 6 links
- Updated frontmatter with proper topics, concepts, and cross-references
