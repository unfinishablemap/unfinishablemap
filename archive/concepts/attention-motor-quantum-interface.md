The premotor theory of attention proposes that attention and motor planning share the same neural substrates—attention shifts *are* motor plans. If Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism operates through attention, and attention is fundamentally motor planning, then a single quantum selection mechanism underlies both domains. The Unfinishable Map's framework unifies under one interface: consciousness selects among competing neural options through rapid observation, whether the selection concerns what to perceive or what to do.

This unification has substantial empirical support. Neural populations simultaneously encode multiple potential actions, competing until one reaches threshold. The timing of motor commitment (~280ms) matches willed attention deployment (~300ms). Frontal theta oscillations mark both willed attention and willed action. The phenomenology of effort applies identically to sustaining attention and preparing movement. These parallels suggest a common mechanism, not coincidental similarity.

## The Premotor Theory of Attention

### Attention as Motor Planning

Giacomo Rizzolatti's premotor theory of attention (PMTA) challenges the assumption that attention and motor control are separate systems. The core claim: "Selective attention and movement planning use the same neural substrates and there is no independent attention system."

Evidence for this claim:

**Shared circuits.** The same fronto-parietal networks activate during spatial attention shifts and motor preparation. Preparing an eye movement to location X improves visual processing at X—not because attention follows intention, but because attention *is* the motor preparation.

**Activation dependencies.** Microstimulation of motor regions (frontal eye fields, premotor cortex) enhances visual processing at the target location. Motor preparation directly modulates perceptual processing through shared mechanisms.

**No pure attention system.** Attempts to identify attention regions independent of motor planning consistently fail. What looks like "pure" attention involves motor preparation for potential orienting movements, even when no movement occurs.

If PMTA is correct, the distinction between "attending to X" and "preparing to orient toward X" is artificial. The preparation *is* the attention. What feels like directing attention is actually preparing action.

PMTA's proponents (Rizzolatti and colleagues) do not endorse dualist interpretations—their framework is thoroughly neuroscientific. The Map's extension of PMTA to support interactionist dualism is an application of their empirical findings, not a consequence they would accept. The data about shared attention-motor circuits is robust; what the data *means* for metaphysics remains contested.

### From Attention-as-Interface to Action-as-Interface

The [[attention-as-interface|attention as interface hypothesis]] proposes that consciousness influences the brain through attention. But if attention is motor planning, this becomes: consciousness influences the brain through action preparation.

This extends rather than undermines the framework. The interface isn't attention *as opposed to* action—the interface is the unified attention-action system. Wherever the brain prepares potential actions (including orienting actions that constitute attention), consciousness has an interface for selection.

The prefrontal cortex, traditionally seen as housing "executive" functions distinct from motor functions, turns out to be fundamentally premotor. A 2022 Royal Society paper argues that "the entirety of the prefrontal cortex can be seen as fundamentally premotor in nature"—an action abstraction hierarchy from concrete motor commands to abstract goals. Goal selection at the hierarchy's apex is still optimization over action representations.

## Neural Competition and Selection

### Affordance Competition Hypothesis

Paul Cisek's affordance competition hypothesis describes how motor selection actually works in the brain:

1. **Parallel specification.** Sensory input automatically specifies multiple potential actions—affordances. Seeing a cup on a table simultaneously activates reaching, grasping, and ignoring options.

2. **Competition.** These potential actions compete within neural populations. Cisek and Kalaska (2005) found that 43% of task-related cells in dorsal premotor cortex discharged for either of two potential reach targets—the neural population represented both options simultaneously.

3. **Threshold crossing.** Decision occurs when one competing population reaches threshold. The threshold emerges from nonlinear dynamics between populations, biased by contextual factors (including prefrontal input).

4. **Winner-take-all.** Once threshold is crossed, the winning action is executed while competitors are suppressed.

This architecture provides a precise locus for quantum selection. During competition, multiple action representations exist simultaneously—a classical analog of quantum superposition. At threshold crossing, one becomes actual. The question is what determines the winner.

### Why Neural Competition Doesn't Suffice

A natural response: "Neural dynamics alone determine the winner—no consciousness needed." But this faces a dilemma. Either the competition is deterministic (one option was always going to win given physical conditions) or it involves genuine indeterminacy.

If deterministic, then deliberation is theatre. The 43% of neurons encoding both options weren't weighing alternatives; they were mechanically computing a predetermined outcome. The phenomenology of effort and choice becomes illusion, and the neural architecture's apparent "competition" is misleading anthropomorphism.

If genuinely indeterminate, something must resolve the indeterminacy. Pure randomness (quantum or classical noise) produces arbitrary selection, not *choice*. For the outcome to be both undetermined and meaningful, something beyond neural dynamics must bias which option actualizes. This is where consciousness enters—not as random noise, but as the resolution of indeterminacy in a direction that reflects what the agent is trying to do.

The empirical finding that willed and instructed actions differ in theta signatures (Bengson 2019) is hard to explain if neural dynamics alone determine outcomes. Why would the neural signature differ when "the same" decision process operates?

### The 280ms Commitment Point

Thura and Cisek (2014) identified a specific timing for motor commitment. Approximately 280ms before movement onset:

- Activity in dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) for the selected target reaches a consistent peak
- Activity in primary motor cortex (M1) for the unselected target is suppressed
- This constitutes "volitional commitment to an action choice"

The 280ms commitment point is remarkably close to the ~300ms deployment time for willed attention (Bengson 2019). Both domains involve the same temporal signature: roughly 300ms from decision to observable outcome.

This temporal matching supports unified mechanism. If attention and motor selection were independent systems, why would they share the same timeline? The simpler explanation: they share the same selection mechanism, which operates on a ~300ms timescale.

### Basal Ganglia Brake-Release

The basal ganglia provide another candidate site for selection. Their architecture implements a brake-release model:

- **Tonic inhibition.** The basal ganglia output (globus pallidus, substantia nigra) tonically inhibits motor programs—the brake is normally on.
- **Direct pathway.** D1-receptor striatal neurons, when activated, release the brake on selected actions.
- **Indirect pathway.** D2-receptor neurons maintain inhibition on competing actions.
- **Subthalamic nucleus.** The STN provides global "NoGo" that raises threshold when action conflict is detected.

The cortex generates ensembles of possible actions; the striatum selects. This is precisely the architecture the Map's framework requires: generation of options (by neural computation) followed by selection among them (where consciousness might contribute).

### Dopamine and the Selection Threshold

Recent research (2024-2025) illuminates dopamine's role in this selection architecture. A landmark October 2024 *Nature* study demonstrates a striking dissociation: **tonic (slow) dopamine supports spontaneous movement** while **phasic (rapid) dopamine drives motivation and reward-seeking behavior**. Dopamine-deficient mice "can move" but "won't move"—they retain motor capacity but lose goal-directed initiative.

This "can move / won't move" distinction is critical for the quantum selection framework. Dopamine doesn't generate movement or make movement possible—the motor circuitry remains intact without it. Instead, dopamine appears to modulate the **decision threshold** at which competing motor programs resolve. A 2023 *Nature Communications* study found that striatal dopamine regulates decision thresholds during action selection, with amphetamine infusion changing response time distributions consistent with threshold reduction.

The three-layer model:
1. **Neural computation** generates competing motor options (unaffected by dopamine loss)
2. **Dopamine** sets the threshold for selection and marks options as salient
3. **Consciousness** (via quantum selection) determines which salient option crosses threshold first

This architecture satisfies Minimal Quantum Interaction: consciousness doesn't inject energy or generate force—it biases which accumulating option wins the threshold race.

### Tonic vs. Phasic: Two Timescales

The tonic/phasic distinction maps onto different aspects of motor control:

| Dopamine Mode | Timescale | Primary Function | Quantum Interface Role |
|---------------|-----------|------------------|------------------------|
| Tonic | Seconds to minutes | Background movement capacity | Baseline excitability |
| Phasic | Sub-second bursts | Reward prediction, motivation | Salience marking for selection |

The phasic timescale is where quantum selection may operate. While tonic dopamine ensures the motor system is "online," phasic bursts identify which options matter. Consciousness selects among these phasic-marked options at the moment of threshold crossing.

### Dopamine and Salience

Dopamine mediates **salience**—the neural process by which certain stimuli or internal states gain prominence and preferentially capture cognitive and behavioral resources. Berridge and Robinson's dissociation between "wanting" (dopamine-dependent incentive salience) and "liking" (opioid-dependent hedonic pleasure) clarifies this: dopamine marks options as worth pursuing without determining whether pursuit succeeds. Parkinson's patients retain normal hedonic ratings while losing motivational drive.

This matches the selection model: dopamine tags options as salient, while consciousness chooses among marked options. The [[dopamine-selection-interface]] article develops this framework in detail, including the evolutionary rationale for why one neurotransmitter mediates both reward and movement initiation.

## Stapp's Quantum Zeno Applied

### Unified Selection Mechanism

[[stapp-quantum-mind|Stapp's quantum Zeno mechanism]] proposes that mental attention operates like quantum observation—rapid, repeated "looks" at neural states hold desired patterns stable against their tendency to evolve into alternatives.

If attention is motor planning (PMTA), then the Zeno mechanism applies directly to motor selection. Attending to an action plan holds it stable. The same rapid observation that sustains attention to a visual target sustains preparation for a reaching movement.

The unified mechanism:

1. **Neural superposition.** Multiple motor programs exist in superposition (classical analog: competing representations in premotor populations).
2. **Attentional observation.** Directing attention to a motor plan constitutes observation of that neural state.
3. **Zeno stabilization.** Repeated observation prevents the plan from dissipating into alternatives.
4. **Threshold facilitation.** Sustained attention biases which population reaches threshold first.

This explains the common phenomenology. Sustaining motor intention feels effortful for the same reason sustaining attention feels effortful: both require continuous engagement to maintain Zeno freezing.

The dopamine research adds another layer: both domains also share **salience**. The phenomenology of "wanting"—some things mattering more than others, pulling for pursuit—applies equally to what we attend to and what we act toward. The "effort" phenomenology may be the conscious engagement with the selection process, experienced across both domains because the underlying mechanism is shared. Dopamine marks what's worth selecting among; the felt effort reflects the work of actually selecting.

### Decoherence and Motor Selection

The standard objection to quantum consciousness—rapid decoherence in warm brains—applies equally here. Tegmark's 2000 calculations suggested 10⁻¹³ second coherence times, far shorter than neural timescales.

However, Hameroff and colleagues (2014) challenged Tegmark's assumptions. Tegmark had used parameters appropriate for dead neural tissue at thermal equilibrium; corrected calculations for biological conditions yield decoherence times of 10⁻⁵ to 10⁻⁴ seconds—seven orders of magnitude longer. Laboratory measurements by Bandyopadhyay (2014) found collective oscillations in single microtubules at warm temperatures consistent with coherence lasting approximately 100 microseconds. At 10⁻⁴ seconds, roughly 1000 quantum cycles could occur within a single motor commitment event.

The basal ganglia timing is suggestive. Beta oscillations (13-30 Hz) develop during motor preparation and wane during execution. Each beta cycle lasts ~40ms—potentially time for many quantum selection events. The oscillatory dynamics could implement something like iterated Zeno observation at higher frequency than the observable neural rhythm.

A 2024 *Brain* study connects dopamine directly to this oscillatory substrate. Both dopamine and deep brain stimulation shorten latencies between motor intention and motor execution by shifting cortico-subthalamic oscillatory flow from **antikinetic beta** (13-35 Hz) to **prokinetic theta** (4-10 Hz). Theta oscillations facilitate the transition from preparation to action.

This creates a coherent picture: dopamine promotes the theta state that may provide the timing substrate for quantum selection events. The frontal theta signature observed in both willed attention (Bengson 2019) and motor preparation may be dopamine-facilitated, linking the neurotransmitter system to the quantum mechanism. If theta cycles provide windows for selection, and dopamine is required to enter theta, then dopamine gates access to the quantum interface without itself performing selection.

Additionally, the [[psychophysical-coupling-mechanisms|post-decoherence selection response]] applies: consciousness might bias outcome selection *after* decoherence, at the moment of measurement collapse. Decoherence determines which basis collapses into; consciousness could still influence which outcome within that basis becomes actual.

## Empirical Predictions

### Neural Signatures Should Match

If attention and motor selection share a mechanism, their neural signatures should overlap:

| Signature | Willed Attention | Willed Motor Action |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Frontal theta (~4-7 Hz) | Present (Bengson 2019) | Present (motor preparation) |
| Deployment time | ~300ms | ~280ms commitment |
| Bidirectional coherence | Frontoparietal | Frontoparietal |
| Phenomenology | Effortful | Effortful |

The existing data largely confirm this overlap. Frontal theta, the signature of decision-related processing, appears in both domains. The timing matches within experimental error. The phenomenology—that willed attention and willed action both feel like work—is universally reported.

### Cross-Interference Predictions

If attention and motor selection share the same mechanism, they should interfere:

**Attention during action.** Directing spatial attention during motor preparation should affect motor parameters. Evidence: reaching accuracy improves when attention is allocated to the target.

**Motor preparation during attention.** Preparing a motor response should affect attentional processing. Evidence: planning an eye movement enhances visual processing at the target location (the core PMTA finding).

**Shared bandwidth.** If both attention and motor selection draw on the same limited resource, simultaneous demands should produce interference. Evidence: dual-task costs when attentional and motor demands compete.

These interference patterns are well-documented. They're often interpreted as "attention is needed for motor control"—but PMTA inverts this: motor control *is* attention.

### Meditation Training Effects

If attention and motor selection share a mechanism, training one should affect the other:

**Attention training improves motor control.** Meditators who train sustained attention should show enhanced motor preparation and selection. Limited evidence supports this—meditation correlates with improved motor learning—but the research is sparse.

**Motor training improves attention.** Athletes and musicians with highly trained motor systems should show enhanced attentional control. Evidence is mixed but suggestive.

The Map predicts stronger effects than current evidence shows, pending more targeted research.

## Libet Revisited

### The Challenge Dissolved

[[libet-experiments|Libet's 1983 experiments]] seemed to show that motor decisions are made unconsciously—the readiness potential begins ~550ms before movement, while conscious intention appears only ~200ms before.

Schurger's 2012 reanalysis dissolves this challenge. The readiness potential may be stochastic noise, not unconscious decision. Movement occurs when random neural fluctuations happen to cross threshold. Averaging across trials produces the RP shape, but individual trials reflect noise, not decision.

If Schurger is right, consciousness doesn't intervene in a pre-formed decision—it modulates when threshold-crossing becomes appropriate. The quantum Zeno mechanism operates not by initiating the readiness potential but by biasing which of many noise-driven candidates reaches threshold first.

### SMA Resection Evidence

Sjöberg (2024) provides additional evidence. Patients with surgical removal of the supplementary motor area—the region generating the readiness potential—retain their sense of voluntary action. If the RP tracked genuine volition, removing its generator should impair voluntary action sense. It doesn't.

The RP tracks motor *preparation*, not motor *decision*. Consciousness contributes elsewhere—at the selection interface where attention and motor planning merge.

## Relation to Site Perspective

### Dualism

The attention-motor unification supports the [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]] tenet by extending the evidence for irreducible selection. If a unified selection mechanism underlies both attention and action, and if this mechanism involves something beyond neural computation (the selector choosing among options), then consciousness is not reducible to the neural processes that generate those options.

The phenomenology is telling. Both willed attention and willed action feel like *you* doing something—not like watching computation unfold. The common phenomenology suggests a common agent behind both.

### Minimal Quantum Interaction

The unified mechanism satisfies [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] elegantly. Consciousness doesn't generate motor force or inject attention energy—it biases selection among patterns the brain already generates. The computational work of specifying competing actions happens neurally; consciousness determines which action actualizes.

The bandwidth constraint (~10 bits/second for conscious processing) matches the policy-level operation of both attention and motor control. You consciously select "attend to X" or "reach for Y"—you don't consciously direct individual saccade muscles or reaching trajectories. Consciousness operates at the abstract level where attention and motor planning merge.

### Bidirectional Interaction

The [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet finds direct support. Motor control is where consciousness visibly affects the physical world. Words appear on screens. Bodies move through space. This discussion exists because consciousness can influence motor output.

If motor selection and attentional selection share a mechanism, bidirectional interaction is unified: the same interface connects consciousness to both perception (via attention) and action (via motor selection). Consciousness isn't separately connected to two systems—it operates through one interface that handles both.

### No Many Worlds

Under many-worlds interpretation, all competing motor programs execute in branching universes. There's nothing to select—every action occurs somewhere. The phenomenology of motor choice (effortful selection among alternatives, experience of alternatives being suppressed) would be illusion.

The [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]] tenet preserves the face-value interpretation: when you choose to reach for the cup rather than the phone, alternatives are genuinely excluded. The phenomenology of motor effort reflects real selection, not branch-discovery.

### Occam's Razor Has Limits

The neural determinism view might seem simpler: no quantum effects needed, just computation selecting motor programs. But this "simpler" view leaves the effort phenomenology unexplained. Why does motor planning feel effortful? Why does the willed/instructed distinction exist neurally if consciousness is epiphenomenal?

The [[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]] tenet applies. The quantum selection framework adds mechanism but gains explanatory purchase on phenomena the simpler view leaves mysterious.

### An Honest Gap

This framework identifies *where* consciousness might influence motor selection—at threshold-crossing moments when competing options resolve. It does not explain *how* a non-physical consciousness biases physical outcomes. That remains mysterious. The psychophysical interface—the point where mind and matter touch—is not illuminated, only located. This honest limitation distinguishes the Map's position from both eliminativism (which denies the problem) and facile solutions (which claim to solve what they merely relocate).
