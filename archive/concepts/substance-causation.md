Substance causation is the view that substances—persisting things with causal powers—are the fundamental causal agents in the world. Events don't cause events; substances cause events by exercising their powers. This metaphysical position, developed most thoroughly by E.J. Lowe and with roots in Aristotelian and Thomistic philosophy, reframes the mind-body problem. If all causation is fundamentally substance causation, then consciousness causing physical events isn't metaphysically exceptional—it's paradigmatic of what causation is.

The Unfinishable Map's [[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]] tenet claims that consciousness causally influences the physical world. Substance causation provides the metaphysical framework for this claim: the conscious subject, as a substance, exercises genuine causal powers at quantum indeterminacies.

## Event Causation vs. Substance Causation

The dominant view in contemporary philosophy is *event causation*: events cause events according to laws. The firing of neuron A causes the firing of neuron B. Your desire (an event) causes your action (another event). Causation is a relation between events, explicable through laws connecting event-types.

Substance causation inverts this. Substances—the neuron, you—are the causal agents. Events are what substances *do*, not independent causal relata. When neuron A fires, the neuron exercises its powers; it isn't that "the firing" causes something. When you act, *you* cause the action—not your desire causing your body to move.

Lowe put it directly: "Substances, not events, are the causal source of all change in the world." Event causation, on this view, is derivative—shorthand for substances exercising powers.

### The Reduction Question

Can event causation reduce to substance causation, or vice versa? Lowe argued that event causation reduces to substance causation: "A caused B" really means "some substance exercised powers that brought about B." Events are happenings involving substances; they don't float free as independent causal relata.

The reverse reduction fails. You can't analyse "substance S exercised power P" purely in terms of events—you need S itself, the thing that persists and acts. Substances are ontologically prior.

This matters for [[mental-causation|mental causation]]. If event causation is fundamental, Kim's exclusion argument has force: mental events compete with physical events for causal responsibility. If substance causation is fundamental, the question shifts: what substances exist and what powers do they have?

## Lowe's Framework

E.J. Lowe developed the most systematic contemporary defence of substance causation in *Personal Agency* (2008). Key elements:

**Four-category ontology**: Lowe distinguishes substances (individual things), kinds (categories substances belong to), modes (particular property instances), and attributes (universal properties). Causation operates primarily at the substance level.

**Powers and liabilities**: Substances have causal powers (capacities to produce effects) and liabilities (susceptibilities to be affected). A match has the power to ignite; wood has the liability to burn. Causation occurs when powers meet liabilities.

**Free agents as unmoved movers**: Lowe argues that free agents are "unmoved movers, or initiators of new causal chains." When you make a choice, *you* initiate the causal chain—there's no prior event that determines your choice. The agent is the ultimate source.

**Volitions as uncaused by events**: Lowe holds that volitions (acts of will) have no *event-cause*—no prior event determines them—but they do have an *agent-cause*: the agent produces them directly. This distinction matters: "uncaused" means uncaused by events, not uncaused simpliciter. Critics find this controversial—it seems to posit brute unexplained events—but Lowe argues this is what genuine agency requires: the agent, not a prior event, is the explanation.

## Why Substance Causation Matters for Consciousness

The standard objection to [[interactionist-dualism|interactionist dualism]] is that consciousness causing physical events would be "metaphysically exceptional"—a mysterious relation unlike ordinary causation. If ordinary causation is event→event following laws, then consciousness→neurons seems anomalous.

Substance causation dissolves this objection. If *all* causation is substances exercising powers, then consciousness causing events is the same *type* of causation as anything else. The rock breaks the window because the rock exercises powers; consciousness affects neurons because consciousness exercises powers. Same metaphysical structure.

This doesn't prove consciousness causes anything—that's an empirical and phenomenological question. But it removes the objection that consciousness *couldn't* cause anything because that would require a fundamentally new kind of causation. On substance causation, it's the same kind: a substance exercising its characteristic powers.

### Relation to Agent Causation

[[Agent-causation|Agent causation]] is substance causation applied specifically to free action. The agent (a substance) directly causes actions by exercising agential powers. Agent-causal libertarians (Chisholm, O'Connor, Lowe, Hasker) hold that free actions are caused by the agent as substance, not by prior mental events.

The conceptual relationship:
- Substance causation is the general metaphysical thesis
- Agent causation is substance causation in the domain of free will
- The conscious subject is the paradigmatic substance exercising causal powers

Jonathan Jacobs and Timothy O'Connor's work (2013) develops this connection explicitly, treating all causation as substance causation in a neo-Aristotelian framework. On this view, agent causation isn't philosophically peculiar—it exemplifies what causation fundamentally is.

## The Causal Closure Question

Kim's exclusion argument against [[mental-causation|mental causation]] depends on [[causal-closure|causal closure]]: every physical event has a sufficient physical cause. If true, mental causes seem excluded—the physical story is complete without them.

Substance causation shifts the dialectic. The question isn't whether physical *events* are sufficient but whether physical *substances* are the only substances with causal powers. Physics describes regularities in what substances do; it doesn't prove that only physical substances exist.

The Map's quantum framework strengthens this response. At quantum indeterminacies, physics specifies probabilities but not outcomes—there's no sufficient physical cause because physics is genuinely incomplete there. Consciousness as substance exercises powers precisely at these openings. The exclusion argument fails because its key premise fails: physical events *don't* have sufficient physical causes at quantum measurement.

This quantum proposal faces the [[decoherence]] objection: quantum coherence in warm brains supposedly decays too fast for conscious influence. The Map's response (detailed in [[quantum-decoherence-objection|quantum decoherence objection]]) involves the scale of quantum effects and the possibility that consciousness operates at timescales compatible with neural quantum processes.

## Challenges to Substance Causation

### The Laws Problem

If substances cause events by exercising powers, what role do laws play? Scientific laws describe regularities—but if substances are fundamental, why is their behaviour regular?

Lowe's response: laws describe what substances of certain kinds tend to do given their powers and liabilities. They're *descriptive* of substance activity, not *productive* of it. The match ignites the wood because of what matches and wood are, not because a law makes them behave that way.

Critics worry this makes laws mysterious. Why do substances of the same kind behave similarly? Without laws playing a productive role, the regularities seem unexplained.

A related concern: what would *falsify* substance causation? If it offers no predictions distinct from event causation, critics charge it's not an empirical hypothesis but a metaphysical preference. The substance causalist response: metaphysical frameworks are evaluated by explanatory power, coherence, and fit with data—not by unique predictions. Substance causation fits better with the phenomenology of agency and solves problems (like mental causation) that event causation notoriously struggles with. These are reasons for acceptance even without a crucial experiment.

### The Agent Problem

If agents cause actions by exercising powers, what about the agent explains *which* action occurs? This is the [[luck-objection|luck objection]] applied to substance causation. In two identical worlds where the agent chooses differently, what explains the difference? The agent, say substance causalists—but critics find this unsatisfying.

The Map's response: consciousness doesn't randomly select but genuinely *chooses* based on reasons. The selection is phenomenologically distinct (effortful rather than passive), neurally distinct (frontal theta, sustained attention), and reasons-responsive. The agent's exercise of causal power is itself the explanation—a legitimate terminus, like physics taking existence as primitive.

### The Pairing Problem

If consciousness is a non-physical substance, how does it connect to *this* particular body? Why does my consciousness affect my neurons rather than yours? This is the [[pairing-problem|pairing problem]].

Substance causation by itself doesn't answer this. But combined with the Map's [[interface-locality|interface locality]] principle, it can: consciousness is spatially located where it causally interfaces with the brain. The pairing is spatial—consciousness affects the quantum systems it's positioned to "observe."

## Historical Context

Substance causation has deep roots:

**Aristotle**: Distinguished efficient causation (what produces change) from the thing that produces it (the substance). Substances have essences that ground their causal powers.

**Aquinas**: Developed this in Christian metaphysics. God is pure act; creatures are composites of act and potency. Causation is actualisation of potency by a substance already in act.

**Reid**: Thomas Reid (1788) is the founding figure of modern agent causation, arguing that active power belongs to agents, not events. Events are "passive," while agents are genuinely active.

**Chisholm**: Roderick Chisholm's revival of agent causation (1964) distinguished "immanent" causation (agent→event) from "transeunt" causation (event→event). Free actions require immanent causation by the agent.

**Lowe**: E.J. Lowe (2008) systematised this into a comprehensive metaphysics where substance causation is fundamental and event causation derivative.

**Neo-Aristotelian revival**: Recent work (Jacobs & O'Connor 2013, Marmodoro 2017, and others) develops substance causation within contemporary analytic metaphysics, treating causal powers as fundamental features of substances.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Substance causation provides the metaphysical foundation for the Map's position on consciousness and causation.

**Bidirectional Interaction**: The tenet that consciousness causally influences physical outcomes assumes consciousness is a substance with causal powers. Substance causation makes this assumption explicit and defensible. The conscious subject doesn't just correlate with physical events—it *causes* them by exercising powers.

**The Mechanism Question**: Substance causation says consciousness causes physical events; the [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet specifies *where* and *how*: at quantum indeterminacies, by biasing probabilities. The metaphysics (substance causation) and physics (quantum interface) complement each other.

**Against Epiphenomenalism**: [[concepts/epiphenomenalism]] denies consciousness has causal powers. Substance causation combined with the self-stultification argument opposes this: if consciousness is a genuine substance—not a mere shadow of physical processes—then it has causal powers by its nature. Substances *act*; that's what makes them substances.

**Dualism Without Anomaly**: The [[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]] tenet holds consciousness is irreducible to physics. Critics object that non-physical causation would be mysterious. Substance causation answers: *all* causation is substances exercising powers. Consciousness exercises its powers just as physical substances exercise theirs. The ontology is dualist; the causal structure is unified.

**Occam's Razor**: Is substance causation extravagant? The [[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]] tenet is relevant here. Substance causation posits substances as fundamental—arguably fewer primitive relations than event causation, which needs events, laws, and the mysterious relation between them. The apparent simplicity of event causation may mask unresolved problems about what laws *do*.
