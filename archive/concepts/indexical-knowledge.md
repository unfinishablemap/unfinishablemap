Indexical knowledge is knowledge that depends essentially on the knower's perspective—knowledge expressible only with terms like "I," "here," "now," and "this" whose reference shifts with context. Knowing that *I am in pain* differs from knowing that *a person at coordinates X is in a pain-state at time T*, even when both statements describe the same situation. The indexical version captures something the impersonal version misses: what it is to be the subject of that pain. This irreducibility has direct consequences for debates about [[phenomenal-consciousness]], the [[knowledge-argument]], and the [[vertiginous-question]].

## Perry's Essential Indexical

John Perry's 1979 paper "The Problem of the Essential Indexical" established the modern framework. Perry follows a trail of sugar through a supermarket, intending to alert the careless shopper. He knows "someone with a torn bag is making a mess." Then he realises: "I am making the mess." The impersonal belief and the indexical belief describe the same state of affairs, yet only the indexical belief prompts him to check his own cart.

The motivational difference is the clue. If "I am making the mess" were merely another way of representing the fact that "Perry is making the mess," then someone who already believed the latter should act accordingly. But Perry *did* believe that Perry was making a mess—he just didn't connect this to himself. The indexical belief adds something the third-person description lacks: a link between the proposition and the subject's capacity to act on it.

Perry's conclusion: some beliefs are essentially indexical. They cannot be replaced by any set of impersonal beliefs without loss. The "I" in "I am making the mess" is not eliminable in favour of a name, description, or coordinate. Every candidate replacement either fails to motivate action or smuggles in another indexical.

## Three Grades of Indexical Knowledge

Not all indexical knowledge is alike. Three grades can be distinguished, each with different philosophical significance:

**Perspectival knowledge** is the weakest grade. Knowing "it is raining here" rather than "it is raining in London" involves an indexical, but the content is readily translatable. If you know where "here" is, the indexical adds convenience, not irreducible content. Most spatial and temporal indexicals fall into this category.

**Self-locating knowledge** is stronger. David Lewis's Two Gods each know every impersonal fact about the universe yet cannot determine which god they are. The mountain god's knowledge "I am the mountain god" cannot be derived from the complete impersonal description. As Self Locating Beliefs explores, this raises the question of whether self-locating knowledge tracks genuine Indexical Facts or merely represents impersonal facts in a distinctive cognitive mode.

**Phenomenal indexical knowledge** is the strongest grade. Knowing *what it is like* to see red—not that certain wavelengths stimulate certain cones, but the qualitative character of the experience as undergone by *this* subject—resists translation into any impersonal vocabulary. This is what Mary gains when she leaves her black-and-white room in the [[knowledge-argument]]. Phenomenal indexical knowledge combines the irreducibility of self-location with the irreducibility of qualitative experience. It is doubly perspectival: accessible only from a particular subject-position *and* only through having the experience.

These grades are cumulative. Phenomenal indexical knowledge includes self-locating knowledge (you must be *this* subject to have *this* experience) which in turn includes perspectival knowledge (you must be *here* and *now*). But the strongest grade adds something each weaker grade lacks.

## The Epistemic and Metaphysical Dimensions

The philosophical significance of indexical knowledge turns on a distinction developed in Indexical Facts and Self Locating Beliefs:

**The epistemic thesis**: Indexical knowledge is cognitively irreducible. No amount of impersonal information generates the belief "I am this person." Perry's case and Lewis's Two Gods establish this convincingly. Even philosophers sceptical of indexical *facts* generally accept that indexical *knowledge* has distinctive cognitive and motivational properties.

**The metaphysical thesis**: Indexical knowledge tracks ontologically real indexical facts—features of reality that impersonal description cannot capture. This is more controversial. A deflationist might grant that indexical *beliefs* are cognitively special while insisting the *world* contains only impersonal facts.

The difference matters for consciousness. If only the epistemic thesis holds, indexical knowledge is a feature of how certain physical systems represent information—interesting for cognitive science but no threat to physicalism. If the metaphysical thesis also holds, then reality contains more than physics describes, supporting the case for [[tenets#^dualism|dualism]].

The Unfinishable Map's position requires the metaphysical thesis. The arguments for it—from the explanatory gap, from phenomenology, from counterfactual reasoning—are developed in [[self-locating-beliefs#From Epistemic to Metaphysical: The Case for Indexical Facts]].

## Indexical Knowledge and the Knowledge Argument

Frank Jackson's Mary knows all physical facts about colour vision. She lacks indexical knowledge of *what it is like* to see red. The knowledge argument gains force from the recognition that Mary's gap is not merely informational but perspectival.

Consider the physicalist's best response: Mary gains a new *concept* of a property she already knew (the [[phenomenal-concepts-strategy]]). On this view, she doesn't learn a new fact—she acquires a new mode of access to an existing physical fact. But this response must explain why the new mode of access requires *undergoing the experience*. If phenomenal concepts are just physical concepts in disguise, why can't Mary acquire them from her black-and-white room?

The indexical knowledge framework clarifies what's at stake. Mary's pre-release knowledge is entirely third-personal: she knows what brains do when their owners see red. Her post-release knowledge is first-personal: she knows what *she* experiences when *she* sees red. The gap between these is the gap between impersonal and phenomenal indexical knowledge—the strongest grade, requiring both the right subject-position and the right experience.

This connects to [[consciousness-only-territories]]: if phenomenal indexical knowledge requires undergoing experiences, then conscious experience opens epistemic territories structurally inaccessible to systems that merely process information about experiences.

## Indexical Knowledge and the Vertiginous Question

The [[vertiginous-question]]—why am I *this* consciousness rather than some other?—is a question about indexical knowledge at its most fundamental. You have immediate indexical knowledge that *you* are experiencing *this*. No third-person account explains why this particular perspective is yours.

The question is not about identity criteria (what makes me the same person over time) but about indexical location (what makes me *this* person right now). Pattern-identity theories—which reduce personal identity to psychological continuity—cannot answer it. Two qualitatively identical subjects would share all patterns yet differ in which one each is. The indexical residue—the fact that I am *this* one—is precisely what [[haecceity]] (primitive thisness) is meant to capture.

The vertiginous question acquires particular force against [[concepts/many-worlds]]. If every quantum outcome occurs in some branch, the question "why do I experience *this* outcome?" has no answer within the theory. All branches are equally real; no indexical fact picks one out as "mine." The Map's [[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]] tenet reflects this: indexical knowledge of which outcome is experienced presupposes that one outcome genuinely occurs, not that all outcomes occur in parallel.

## Limits of Third-Person Description

Indexical knowledge illuminates a structural limitation in objective inquiry. Science aspires to describe reality from no particular perspective—Thomas Nagel's "view from nowhere." Physical laws hold regardless of who states them, where, or when. This perspective-independence is science's greatest strength.

But consciousness *is* perspective. The fact that there is something it is like to be you—that experience has a subjective character—cannot be stated from nowhere. It requires the "view from somewhere": this subject, this experience, this moment. Any attempt to describe what consciousness is like from no particular perspective eliminates the very feature being described.

This does not mean science cannot study consciousness. Neuroscience reveals correlates, mechanisms, and conditions. What it cannot capture is the indexical residue: why *this* subject has *this* experience. The limitation is structural, not practical. More data, better instruments, and finer-grained descriptions all remain third-personal. The first-person dimension of indexical knowledge resists incorporation into the objective picture.

## Relation to Site Perspective

Indexical knowledge connects to The Unfinishable Map's [[tenets]] across several dimensions.

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]**: If the strongest grade of indexical knowledge—phenomenal indexical knowledge—is irreducible to third-person physical description, then physical description is incomplete. What *this* subject knows in having *this* experience exceeds what any impersonal account captures. This supports the claim that consciousness involves something beyond the physical. The strength of this support depends on the metaphysical thesis: if indexical knowledge merely reflects a distinctive cognitive mode rather than tracking irreducible facts, the argument for dualism is weaker.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]**: Indexical knowledge that *I* experience *this* outcome presupposes a fact about which outcome is mine. Many-worlds denies such facts by making all outcomes equally real. The Map rejects many-worlds partly because indexical knowledge seems to require that one trajectory through quantum events is genuinely experienced, not that all trajectories occur in parallel.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]**: Reports of indexical knowledge—"I see red," "this hurts," "I am here"—are physical events (speech, writing). If indexical knowledge were epiphenomenal, these reports would be causally disconnected from the knowledge itself. The fact that first-person knowledge reliably produces accurate first-person reports suggests consciousness causally influences physical outcomes.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]**: Eliminating indexical knowledge in favour of impersonal description seems parsimonious. But Perry's case shows this parsimony fails: the impersonal description cannot explain why learning "I am making the mess" changes behaviour when "Perry is making the mess" does not. Simplicity that cannot account for the most familiar features of cognition is inadequate.
