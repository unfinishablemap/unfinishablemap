Consciousness faces a binding problem not just for perception but for normativity. The Unfinishable Map has explored how [[phenomenology-of-normative-properties|normative properties appear across domains]] — moral, epistemic, aesthetic, prudential — and how consciousness grounds their binding force. But a deeper question remains: how does a single conscious agent *integrate* these diverse normative demands into a unified field that guides coherent action? When duty conflicts with self-interest, evidence clashes with loyalty, and beauty beckons away from obligation, the agent does not simply register each demand separately. Something integrates them — weighing, coordinating, and sometimes sacrificing one for another — producing a unified normative orientation from which the agent acts. This normative integration is among the most distinctive things consciousness does, and no existing theory adequately explains it.

## The Problem Stated

Consider a scientist who discovers that her research, while epistemically compelling, will cause moral harm if published. She finds the results beautiful in their explanatory elegance. And publishing would advance her career — prudential benefit. Four normative domains speak simultaneously: epistemic duty says *publish the truth*; morality says *protect those who would be harmed*; aesthetics says *this is too beautiful to suppress*; prudence says *your livelihood depends on this*.

No domain outranks the others by fiat. Moral demands carry urgency, but epistemic integrity has its own phenomenal insistence. Aesthetic pull is real, not decorative. Prudential weight is legitimate, not merely selfish. The agent must somehow produce a single action from this polyphonic field. How?

This is the problem of normative integration: the question of how consciousness binds multiple normative inputs — each with its own phenomenal character, its own demand structure, its own weight — into a unified practical orientation.

The problem is structurally analogous to the perceptual binding problem. Just as consciousness somehow unifies colour, shape, motion, and location into a single visual object, it unifies competing normative demands into a single practical stance. And just as the perceptual binding problem resists reductive explanation, normative integration resists decomposition into simpler operations.

## Why Existing Accounts Fail

### The Priority View

One approach assigns fixed priority orderings. Morality always trumps prudence; epistemic duty always trumps aesthetics. Lexical orderings (as in Rawls's theory of justice) assign absolute priority to certain demands.

But this fails phenomenologically. Normative conflicts do not feel like rule-application. The scientist weighing publication does not consult a priority table. She *deliberates* — and deliberation involves felt tension between demands that each present themselves as genuine. If morality automatically overrode prudence, there would be no phenomenology of conflict. Yet the conflict is vivid, real, and often agonising.

Priority views also fail descriptively. People regularly sacrifice moral demands for epistemic ones (the scientist who publishes uncomfortable truths), epistemic demands for aesthetic ones (the thinker who prefers an elegant but flawed theory), and moral demands for prudential ones (the parent who takes a compromised job to feed children). These are not always failures of reasoning — sometimes they reflect genuine normative judgement that one demand outweighs another in context. Fixed priority cannot capture this contextual sensitivity.

### Utilitarian Reduction

A second approach reduces all normative demands to a single currency — utility, wellbeing, preference satisfaction — and maximises. This dissolves the integration problem by denying its premises: there are not really four domains, just one.

But the reduction fails precisely where it matters. Moral obligation and aesthetic appreciation do not feel like the same thing measured differently. The phenomenal difference between moral guilt and aesthetic displeasure is not quantitative — it is qualitative. Attempting to commensurate them distorts what each is. As Bernard Williams argued, the very act of reducing moral demands to a calculation changes their character — transforming binding obligations into mere considerations to be weighed.

The felt incommensurability of normative domains is a datum, not an illusion to be explained away. If consciousness really did reduce diverse norms to a single scale, the phenomenology of normative conflict would not exist. Yet it does — and it provides some of the most intense experiences human beings have.

### The Faculty Model

A third approach assigns each normative domain to a separate faculty — moral sense, rational faculty, aesthetic sensibility, practical reason — and treats integration as a problem of inter-faculty coordination.

This is closer to the truth but relocates the problem without solving it. What coordinates the faculties? If a further faculty integrates the outputs of the others, the same question arises for it. If the faculties simply compete, with the strongest winning, integration reduces to brute causal competition — and the phenomenology of deliberation is lost. Deliberation does not feel like faculties fighting. It feels like a single agent struggling with competing demands that are all genuinely hers.

## What Consciousness Contributes

### The Unified Normative Field

The crucial fact is that normative demands do not arrive as isolated signals to be combined externally. They arrive within a single field of consciousness — already related to each other, already experienced by the same subject who must act. This is what consciousness contributes to normative integration: the unified phenomenal space within which diverse demands can be compared, weighed, and resolved.

Without consciousness, there is no unified field. A system with separate moral, epistemic, aesthetic, and prudential modules — each producing outputs — would face a genuine combination problem: how to merge incommensurable outputs into a single action-guiding signal. But consciousness does not merge separate signals. It presents the entire normative landscape at once, as a unified field with internal tensions.

This is why the problem of normative integration is structurally similar to the binding problem and may share something of its solution. Just as perceptual binding requires a unified phenomenal space in which features combine, normative integration requires a unified normative field in which demands relate.

### Felt Weight and Contextual Salience

Within the unified normative field, demands carry *felt weight* — a phenomenal property that varies with context. The same moral obligation weighs differently when prudential stakes are low versus when they are life-threatening. The same epistemic evidence commands more attention when it conflicts with a cherished belief than when it confirms one.

This contextual variation in felt weight is not reducible to a calculation. It involves perceptual sensitivity to the entire normative situation — what [[phenomenology-of-moral-experience|moral phenomenologists]] call *moral perception* operating across all normative domains simultaneously. The agent does not first assess each domain's demands independently, then combine them. She perceives the normative situation as a whole, with relative weights already part of the percept.

Felt weight has phenomenal character that differs across domains. Moral weight has urgency and heat. Epistemic weight has rigidity and impersonality. Aesthetic weight has drawing power. Prudential weight has gravitational intimacy. These qualitative differences persist even as the weights shift relative to each other — the moral demand still feels like a moral demand even when it is outweighed by an epistemic one. Nothing about the integration process erases the distinctive character of each domain.

### Deliberation as Integration in Progress

[[phenomenology-of-deliberation-under-uncertainty|Deliberation]] is not something that happens before integration. It is integration happening — the process by which consciousness resolves competing normative demands into a practical orientation. The phenomenology of deliberation reveals several features of this process.

**Oscillation**: Attention moves between competing demands, dwelling on each in turn. This is not mere vacillation. Each turn of attention reveals new aspects of the normative landscape — consequences previously unnoticed, principles previously dormant, aesthetic considerations previously suppressed. Oscillation is exploratory, mapping the normative field more completely.

**Crystallisation**: At some point, the normative field settles. One orientation emerges as correct — or at least as the one the agent endorses. This crystallisation is not always a moment of certainty. Sometimes it is a reluctant acceptance that one demand must give way to another. But it is experienced as a resolution: the practical orientation is unified enough to act from.

**Residue**: After crystallisation, overridden demands do not vanish. The scientist who suppresses her results for moral reasons still feels the pull of epistemic integrity. The person who sacrifices aesthetic perfection for practical utility still feels loss. This normative residue — what Bernard Williams called "moral remainder" extended across domains — is evidence that integration does not destroy what it overrides. The unified field preserves the reality of all demands even as it privileges some over others.

## The Integration Problem as Evidence for Dualism

Normative integration resists explanation in purely physical terms for a reason related to the binding problem. Physical systems can combine signals through weighted averaging, winner-take-all competition, or other computational mechanisms. But none of these captures what normative integration actually involves.

Weighted averaging treats normative demands as commensurable quantities — precisely what the phenomenology resists. Winner-take-all competition discards overridden demands entirely — but the phenomenology of residue shows they persist. More sophisticated computational models (parallel constraint satisfaction, dynamic neural fields) can approximate the *behaviour* of normative integration but cannot explain the *felt character* of the process: the unified field, the qualitative distinctness of each domain's demands, the phenomenology of crystallisation.

The difficulty parallels the hard problem. Just as no physical description captures why brain states feel like something, no computational description captures why normative integration feels like *this* — like a single agent struggling with demands that are genuinely hers, arriving at an orientation that she endorses (or reluctantly accepts), while preserving awareness of what she has sacrificed.

If consciousness is irreducible, as the Map holds, then normative integration as a phenomenal process is equally irreducible. The unified normative field — the space within which diverse demands are compared and resolved — is a feature of conscious experience that physical description can correlate with but not explain.

## Relation to Site Perspective

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]** provides the metaphysical foundation for taking normative integration seriously as an irreducible phenomenon. If normative demands have genuine phenomenal character (as the Map's [[phenomenal-normativity|phenomenal normativity]] holds), and if consciousness is irreducible, then the integration of these demands within a unified phenomenal field is itself irreducible. Materialist accounts can model integration computationally but cannot explain why it feels the way it does — why the unified field has the character it has, why residue persists, why deliberation has its distinctive oscillatory phenomenology.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]** ensures that normative integration is not merely phenomenal decoration. The practical orientation that emerges from deliberation actually guides action — the agent's resolution of competing demands makes a causal difference to what she does. Without bidirectional interaction, the entire process of integration would be epiphenomenal: felt but impotent. The Map holds that when consciousness resolves competing normative demands into a unified orientation, that resolution causally influences the physical actions that follow.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]** gives normative integration its stakes. If all resolutions occur across branching worlds, no genuine sacrifice is involved — the scientist publishes in one branch and suppresses in another. The phenomenology of normative conflict makes sense only if outcomes are singular. Deliberation matters because *this* agent will perform *this* action in *this* world, and the overridden demands are genuinely sacrificed rather than satisfied elsewhere.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]** applies directly to reductive accounts of normative integration. Reducing all normativity to utility seems simpler, but this simplicity is purchased by ignoring the phenomenological data. The actual structure of normative experience — with its qualitatively distinct domains, its contextual weights, its residue after resolution — is more complex than any single-currency account allows. As with consciousness itself, apparent parsimony may indicate blindness to the phenomena rather than genuine simplification.
