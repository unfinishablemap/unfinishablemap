When someone says "I see red" or "I am in pain," their report carries a distinctive epistemic authority that third-person observation cannot straightforwardly replicate. A neuroscientist might know everything about the subject's brain state, yet the subject knows something the neuroscientist does not: what the experience is like from inside. The Unfinishable Map argues that this first-person testimonial authority is not a mere epistemic convenience awaiting replacement by better instruments. The character of this authority — that phenomenal reports resist displacement not because our instruments are crude but because the subject's relationship to their experience is constitutive rather than observational — points toward an ontological distinction that physicalism struggles to accommodate.

This article examines a specific question that neighbouring articles leave open. The [[phenomenology-of-trust-and-testimony|phenomenology of trust and testimony]] explores the felt experience of receiving testimony. The [[consciousness-and-the-authority-of-logic|authority of logic]] examines why logical compulsion requires consciousness. The question here is different: why does testimony *about consciousness* carry an authority that testimony about other matters does not, and what does this asymmetry reveal about the nature of mind?

## The Asymmetry of Testimonial Authority

Testimony about the external world is defeasible in a familiar way. If someone says "there is a cat on the mat," others can check. Instruments can verify. The testifier might be mistaken, lying, or hallucinating, and third-party evidence can settle the matter. The authority of the testimony is provisional — it holds until better evidence arrives.

Testimony about one's own conscious experience resists this pattern. If someone says "I am experiencing a sharp pain in my left knee," no brain scan, behavioural analysis, or physiological measurement can straightforwardly override this claim. A neurologist might discover that the knee shows no damage, that nociceptive pathways are inactive, or that the brain region typically associated with pain is quiet. None of this shows that the person is not in pain. It shows that their pain has an unusual aetiology, or that standard neural correlates do not always apply.

This is not to say that first-person reports are beyond challenge. In anosognosia, split-brain confabulation, and certain psychiatric conditions, clinicians do weigh clinical assessment against self-report — and sometimes override it. But these cases involve disruptions to the very cognitive systems that generate accurate phenomenal reports. They show that the reporting mechanism can malfunction, not that a properly functioning third-person method can displace first-person access. The authority of phenomenal testimony is defeasible at the margins but resistant to wholesale displacement in a way that testimony about external states is not.

This asymmetry is not absolute. People can be confused about the character of their experience, mislabelling emotions or mislocating sensations. Eric Schwitzgebel (2008) documents extensive evidence that naive introspection is unreliable in many domains, and the [[introspection-rehabilitation|rehabilitation of introspection]] shows that first-person reports are fallible. But the *kind* of fallibility involved is different from external testimony. When someone misreports an external state of affairs, the error is between the report and the world. When someone mischaracterises their experience, the error is between the report and a phenomenal reality to which only they have access. No third party is better positioned to correct the error, because no third party has the relevant access.

## Why Third-Person Displacement Fails

The materialist programme in philosophy of mind includes an implicit promise: that first-person testimony about consciousness will eventually be superseded by third-person neuroscience, just as testimony about disease has been superseded by medical diagnostics. On this view, "I see red" is like "I feel feverish" — a rough folk report that more precise instruments will refine and eventually replace.

This analogy breaks down at a critical point. When a thermometer shows 37°C and the patient says "I feel feverish," the thermometer does not contradict the patient's experience. It measures something different — body temperature rather than the feeling of fever. The patient might genuinely feel feverish at a normal temperature, and no amount of temperature data refutes the felt quality of the experience. What the thermometer displaces is not the phenomenal report but the folk theory that feeling feverish reliably indicates elevated body temperature.

The same logic applies to consciousness more broadly. Brain imaging can displace folk theories about which neural processes correlate with which experiences. It cannot displace the experiences themselves, because it measures something categorically different. Neural activity is a third-person observable; phenomenal experience is a first-person reality. Conflating the refinement of folk theories with the displacement of phenomenal reports is a persistent risk in eliminativist and reductionist approaches.

Daniel Dennett's "heterophenomenology" attempted to dissolve this asymmetry by treating first-person reports as third-person data — verbal behaviours to be catalogued and explained without assuming they are windows into subjective reality. Dennett presents this as methodological neutrality: study the reports without presupposing what generates them. But neutrality in practice becomes denial when the method systematically sets aside the very feature that makes phenomenal reports distinctive — that they are made by beings who are *undergoing* the experience, not merely detecting it. If phenomenal consciousness is real, heterophenomenology brackets its most important feature and risks never recovering it.

## First-Person Authority and the Knowledge Argument

The authority of testimony about consciousness connects directly to Frank Jackson's [[knowledge-argument|knowledge argument]]. Mary, the colour scientist who knows all the physical facts about colour vision but has never seen red, learns something new when she first sees it. What she learns is what red looks like — a phenomenal fact that her comprehensive physical knowledge did not contain. (Jackson himself later rejected this conclusion, arguing that Mary gains a new representational ability rather than a new fact. The Map follows the majority of philosophers who hold that the argument's force survives its author's change of heart — the testimonial dimension explored here is one reason why.)

The testimonial dimension of this thought experiment is underappreciated. Before her release, Mary could receive testimony from others about their colour experiences. She could hear them say "red looks warm and vivid" or "blue has a cool, receding quality." This testimony would convey genuine information — Mary would learn something about the structure of others' colour experience. But it would not convey the phenomenal fact itself. No testimony from any number of colour-sighted people can give Mary the knowledge she gains from her own first experience of red.

This reveals a limit inherent in testimony about consciousness. Such testimony can convey structural, relational, and comparative information about phenomenal experience. It can tell you that this experience is more like that one than another, that it is intense or subtle, pleasant or aversive. What it cannot convey is the qualitative character itself. The testifier has authoritative access to this character; the recipient does not. This testimonial gap is not a failure of language or communication skill. It reflects something about the nature of phenomenal properties — they are accessible in a way that essentially involves being the subject who has them. The gap is a specific instance of the [[problem-of-other-minds]] — we can never fully access another's qualitative experience, only receive structured reports about it.

## Testimony, Consciousness, and Science

The authority of first-person testimony about consciousness is not merely a philosophical curiosity. It shapes the methodology of consciousness science.

Most empirical studies of consciousness involve subjects' reports at some stage — and those that do not (such as brain-based measures like the perturbational complexity index for non-communicating patients) still ultimately calibrate against first-person reports from other subjects. When a researcher uses binocular rivalry to study visual awareness, the experimental design depends on the subject accurately reporting which image they consciously see. When anaesthesia researchers investigate the boundary between consciousness and unconsciousness, the most important data point is what the patient reports experiencing. Neural correlates of consciousness are identified precisely by correlating third-person brain data with first-person phenomenal reports.

This methodological dependence is often treated as a practical limitation — first-person reports are used because we lack better instruments. But the Map argues it reflects something deeper. Consciousness is the kind of thing whose existence and character are known primarily through the testimony of the beings who have it. This is not because our instruments are crude. It is because consciousness, by its nature, presents itself to the subject who experiences it. Third-person methods access consciousness indirectly, through the testimony of subjects, because there is no way to observe phenomenal experience from outside.

If first-person testimony were systematically unreliable, consciousness science would collapse. Not because science needs convenient data sources, but because the subject matter — what it is like to be conscious — is accessible only through beings who can testify about it. The methodological status of such reports — as genuine [[phenomenological-evidence]] rather than mere behavioural data — is central to the enterprise. The scientific enterprise takes testimony about consciousness seriously in practice even when philosophical programmes try to eliminate its authority in theory.

## The Eliminativist Bind

Eliminativism about consciousness faces a distinctive problem with testimony. If Paul Churchland is right that folk-psychological states like beliefs, desires, and qualia do not exist, then reports like "I see red" or "I feel anxious" are systematically false — not merely imprecise but making claims about entities that have no place in a mature neuroscience.

A sophisticated eliminativist might respond that this misdescribes the programme. Eliminativism does not deny that *something* is happening when people report experiences — it denies that folk-psychological categories like "qualia" accurately describe what is happening, just as "phlogiston" inaccurately described combustion. On this view, the eliminativist is reforming our theoretical vocabulary, not denying the phenomena wholesale.

But this response faces its own difficulty. The eliminativist's position is itself expressed through testimony. Churchland testifies that he believes eliminativism is true, that he has reasons for holding this view, that the evidence compels this conclusion. If phenomenal states and beliefs do not exist, then Churchland's testimony about his own intellectual commitments is as empty as anyone else's testimony about their qualia. The eliminativist cannot coherently claim testimonial authority for the position that denies the authority of testimony about conscious states.

This is not merely the familiar self-refutation argument dressed in different clothing. The testimonial framing adds something. The eliminativist must *ask others to believe their testimony* — to accept their reports about what neuroscience shows, what philosophy demonstrates, what reasoning requires. Asking others to accept testimony while denying the authority of testimony about consciousness involves relying on the very capacity one seeks to eliminate. The eliminativist's own intellectual testimony presupposes the kind of conscious, rationally accountable reporting that eliminativism declares illusory. The vocabulary-reform defence does not help here: even if "qualia" is the wrong word, the eliminativist's testimony still depends on there being *something it is like* to understand an argument and find it compelling — and that is precisely what is at issue.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The Map's [[tenets]] find natural support in the authority of testimony about consciousness.

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]** gains evidential force from the irreducibility of first-person testimony — but the argument requires care. A sophisticated physicalist can accept that subjects have privileged epistemic access to their own brain states via internal monitoring mechanisms that are themselves physical, without conceding that experiences are non-physical. The testimonial asymmetry, taken alone, establishes only an epistemic difference.

The Map's argument goes further. The relevant asymmetry is not merely that the subject has *better* access to their experience — the kind of access a well-placed instrument might replicate. It is that the subject's relationship to phenomenal experience is constitutive: feeling pain is not monitoring a pain-state the way a thermometer monitors temperature, but being in a state whose existence consists partly in its being felt. If consciousness were identical to brain states, then complete physical knowledge of those states should in principle capture everything about them — yet the knowledge argument shows it does not. The testimonial asymmetry is a symptom of this deeper gap between physical description and phenomenal reality, and that gap is what dualism explains.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]** is presupposed by the very act of giving testimony about consciousness. When someone reports their experience, their phenomenal state must causally influence their verbal behaviour — otherwise the report would bear no systematic relationship to the experience it purports to describe. If consciousness were epiphenomenal, testimony about it would be coincidental rather than authoritative. The authority of phenomenal testimony depends on consciousness making a causal difference to what gets said.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]** matters here because the many-worlds interpretation would make testimonial authority perspectival rather than metaphysically grounded. If every quantum measurement spawns equally real branches, each branch-copy of a testifier has equal authority about their experience — and no branch is privileged. The Map's rejection of many-worlds preserves the idea that when someone testifies about their conscious experience, they are reporting on a single actualised reality, not one perspective among countless equally real alternatives. Testimonial authority presupposes that there is a fact of the matter about what the subject experienced — that their report answers to one actual outcome, not a spectrum of branch-relative truths.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]** applies to the temptation to dissolve first-person authority. The simpler theory — that all testimony is just verbal behaviour to be explained neurologically, with no privileged first-person access — gains its simplicity by discarding a real phenomenon. The authority of testimony about consciousness is a datum to be explained, not an illusion to be dispelled. Theories that achieve simplicity by denying what subjects actually report about their experience have purchased parsimony at the cost of adequacy.

The [[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]] tenet is tangential to the testimonial argument. Testimonial authority provides evidence for dualism and bidirectional interaction without depending on any specific mechanism by which consciousness interfaces with the physical world.
