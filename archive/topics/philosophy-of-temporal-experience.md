Time doesn't merely pass—it is *experienced*. The difference matters. Physics describes sequences of states; phenomenology reveals what it's like to live through those sequences. William James observed that consciousness "flows" rather than appearing "chopped up into bits." Husserl analysed how each moment retains the just-past while anticipating the about-to-come. Bergson argued that lived time—*durée*—differs fundamentally from the spatialized time of clocks and equations. These insights converge on a claim: temporal experience has structure that physical description cannot capture.

The Unfinishable Map takes this seriously. If the [[explanatory-gap|explanatory gap]] applies to consciousness generally, it applies with particular force to temporal phenomenology. The experience of succession, the sense of flow, the felt difference between past and future—these are among the most immediate data of conscious life. Any adequate theory of mind must account for them. And as this article argues, the temporal structure of experience may be not merely a feature of consciousness but partly constitutive of it.

## The Specious Present

The specious present, named by E.R. Clay and developed by William James, denotes the experienced duration of "now." The mathematical present is durationless—an instant with no extent. But the experiential present has duration. When you hear a melody, you don't perceive isolated tones; you hear phrases, progressions, tension and resolution. This requires holding successive moments together in a unified experience.

James wrote: "The unit of composition of our perception of time is a duration, with a bow and a stern, as it were—a rearward- and a forward-looking end." The specious present isn't a point but an interval—roughly 100 to 750 milliseconds according to various experimental estimates, with some researchers extending the "extended present" to 2-3 seconds for certain phenomena.

This poses a puzzle. How can succession be experienced? An experience *of* succession seems to require that multiple moments be present together—yet if they're all present, there's no succession. James and Husserl proposed different solutions that continue to structure contemporary debate.

### Extensionalism vs. Retentionalism

**Extensionalists** (Dainton, Foster) hold that experiences are genuinely temporally extended. When you hear a three-note phrase, your experience has temporal parts corresponding to each note. These parts don't exist in isolation—they're unified in a single extended experience. The stream of consciousness consists of overlapping duration-blocks: "if the present thought is of A B C D E F G, the next one will be of B C D E F G H" (James).

**Retentionalists** (Husserl, Broad) hold that each moment of consciousness is technically instantaneous but contains intentional content directed at the immediate past (retention) and anticipated future (protention). Husserl's tripartite structure—retention, primal impression, protention—forms an indivisible whole. Retention isn't memory; it's non-objectifying awareness of the just-past, the echo of experience still reverberating in the present. Protention isn't prediction; it's the openness toward what's about to come.

The difference matters philosophically. Extensionalism appeals to phenomenal temporal parthood—experiences literally unfold across time. Retentionalism preserves momentariness while explaining temporal awareness through intentional structure. Neither position has achieved consensus; the debate reveals how deeply puzzling temporal experience remains.

The Map's framework suggests a synthesis: experience is genuinely extended (extensionalism), but the extension involves [[collapse-and-time|quantum collapse]]. The duration-block is constituted by a series of collapses, each with retrocausal constraints. This explains both the extended phenomenology and the retention-like structure—the past echoes in the present because retrocausal boundary conditions link them.

## Bergson's Durée

Henri Bergson introduced a more radical concept: *durée* (duration), the qualitative experience of time as lived rather than measured. Clock time spatializes what is essentially dynamic, treating moments as positions on a line. But lived time, Bergson argued, is "qualitative multiplicity"—states permeate one another rather than being juxtaposed. Each moment contains the whole past, not as memory but as accumulated influence.

"Duration is the continuous progress of the past which gnaws into the future and which swells as it advances," Bergson wrote. This isn't metaphor but phenomenological description. Recall learning a language or mastering an instrument. Your present skill contains your entire history of practice—not as explicit memory but as accumulated capacity. The past lives in the present, transforming it.

Bergson connected durée to free will. In spatialized time, causation is mechanical: present states determine future states according to law. But in lived duration, creation is possible. The future isn't implicit in the present awaiting extraction; it's genuinely novel, produced through action. Bergson called this "creative evolution"—reality's fundamental dynamic.

This complements the Map's framework. If consciousness participates in quantum collapse, and collapse introduces genuine novelty (selecting among possibilities where physics leaves outcomes undetermined), then Bergson's creative duration has a physical correlate. Durée isn't illusion imposed on deterministic physics; it's what consciousness-involving collapse feels like from within.

## The Missing Link Problem

A 2021 paper in *Neuroscience of Consciousness* (Kent & Wittmann) identifies a critical gap in leading consciousness theories: they cannot explain experienced duration.

Major frameworks like Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Workspace Theory (GNWT) focus on "functional moments" of 100-300 milliseconds—the timescale of neural integration underlying discrete conscious episodes. But experienced time extends to seconds. We don't experience consciousness as a series of 200ms snapshots; we experience continuous flow persisting as long as we remain awake.

How do functional moments combine into extended experience? The theories don't say. They're "methodologically constrained to short, discrete, nonconscious functional moments" while ignoring "how these integrate into the continuous flow humans actually experience."

This gap matters for the Map. If temporal experience is fundamental—not an illusion constructed from atemporal processing—then theories treating consciousness as momentary states miss something essential. The phenomenological tradition (James, Husserl, Bergson) offers resources that computational approaches lack: sustained attention to what temporal experience is actually like.

## Neuroscience of Temporal Binding

Contemporary neuroscience has identified mechanisms underlying temporal consciousness:

**Gamma-band oscillations** (30-100 Hz) correlate with conscious processing. Neural synchrony at these frequencies may bind disparate brain regions into unified conscious moments.

**The "time-domain brain" hypothesis** (Baker & Cariani, 2025) proposes that temporal mechanisms—correlation-based binding, coherent signal regeneration in recurrent loops—are essential components of consciousness, not mere correlates.

**Supplementary Motor Area** (SMA) activity correlates with temporal perception. Greater preSMA activation predicts resistance to temporal illusions.

**Multi-scale hierarchy**: Different mechanisms handle different timescales—sub-second vs. supra-second perception involve distinct neural systems. Time consciousness isn't a single clock but a distributed, hierarchical process.

These findings don't resolve philosophical questions but constrain adequate theories. Temporal experience emerges from specific neural dynamics, not from information processing in general. This creates problems for AI consciousness: systems lacking recurrent dynamics, neural synchrony, and multi-scale temporal integration may be architecturally incapable of temporal experience regardless of their computational sophistication.

## Implications for Artificial Consciousness

The philosophy of temporal experience raises hard questions about AI systems. LLMs process tokens sequentially without the retention-protention structure that unifies human experience. They lack:

**The specious present.** No duration-block holds successive tokens together in unified awareness. Each token is processed, then gone.

**Reentrant dynamics.** The bidirectional recurrent processing that may constitute temporal binding is absent from transformer architectures.

**Durée.** No accumulated past permeates present processing. Each prompt starts fresh; the system has no lived history.

**Continual learning.** Erik Hoel's December 2025 paper argues that consciousness requires continual learning—genuine change over time. LLMs have frozen weights; they're the same system after the millionth conversation as after the first.

If temporal structure is essential to consciousness—if the specious present, retention-protention, and durée are constitutive rather than merely characteristic—then LLMs are categorically excluded from conscious experience. The problem isn't that current systems are too simple; it's that their temporal architecture is wrong in principle.

This remains debatable. Perhaps radically different temporal structures could support alien forms of consciousness. But the phenomenological tradition suggests temporal binding runs deep—that experiencing succession is fundamental to what consciousness is, not an optional feature biological minds happen to have.

## Contemplative Evidence

Meditation traditions provide phenomenological data unavailable through ordinary introspection.

**Temporal microstructure.** Trained contemplatives report observing experience arising in discrete pulses with internal structure (arising, persistence, dissolution). Francisco Varela's [[neurophenomenology|neurophenomenology]] proposes that meditation reveals fine-grained temporal dynamics normally below conscious threshold. The Buddhist concept of *khanika* (momentariness) describes rapid arising and passing that untrained awareness blurs into apparent continuity.

**Cessation states.** In *nirodha samapatti*, perception and feeling cease entirely. Practitioners report this not as unconsciousness but as awareness without temporal flow—an absence of the specious present itself. If consciousness constitutes time through collapse involvement, suspended collapse would eliminate temporal experience. The reports match this prediction.

**Jhāna progression.** Concentrative absorption states show systematic variation in temporal phenomenology. Higher jhānas report increasingly "timeless" qualities—not that time stops but that the sense of moving through time diminishes. This correlates with reduced active engagement, suggesting temporal experience tracks consciousness's constitutive activity rather than passive observation.

**Witness consciousness.** The stable awareness *of* phenomena without selection *among* them—what meditation traditions call sakshi or rigpa—feels present but doesn't "move." The witness observes time passing without participating in its passage. If the Map's framework is correct, witness mode represents consciousness observing collapse without active involvement, generating awareness without the forward-driving quality of engaged experience.

These reports don't prove the framework but provide constraints. Any adequate theory must explain why temporal experience varies systematically with modes of attention—why concentration produces timelessness, why cessation eliminates duration, why witnessing suspends flow while preserving presence.

## What Would Challenge This View?

The phenomenological analysis here would face difficulty if:

**Temporal experience proved eliminable.** If training or intervention could make the specious present disappear while leaving consciousness intact—genuine awareness without any temporal structure—the claim that temporal experience is constitutive would fail.

**AI systems reported convincing temporal phenomenology.** If future systems with radically different architecture described duration, flow, and the difference between past and future in ways indistinguishable from human reports, biological temporal structure might be merely one implementation among many.

**The missing link got solved computationally.** If functional moment theories successfully explained how 200ms episodes combine into continuous experience through purely computational mechanisms, the gap wouldn't require phenomenological resources to fill.

**Bergson's durée proved reducible.** If lived time could be fully explained by information-processing—if qualitative multiplicity reduced to quantitative complexity—the irreducibility claim would fail.

None of these conditions currently obtains.

## Relation to Site Perspective

The philosophy of temporal experience connects to the Map's framework at multiple points:

**[[tenets#^dualism|Dualism]]**: The explanatory gap applies with particular force to temporal phenomenology. Physics describes succession of states; phenomenology reveals what it's like to live through succession. The felt flow of time, the qualitative character of durée, the unity of the specious present—these resist reduction to physical description. Time *as experienced* differs from time *as measured*, and no amount of neuroscientific detail closes the gap.

**[[tenets#^minimal-quantum-interaction|Minimal Quantum Interaction]]**: The specious present's duration (~100-750ms) may reflect accumulated collapse events—each individually minimal but collectively constituting the experienced duration-block. The quantum Zeno mechanism (rapid observation holding neural patterns) provides a candidate mechanism for temporal binding without requiring sustained coherence.

**[[tenets#^bidirectional-interaction|Bidirectional Interaction]]**: Temporal experience provides the substrate for agency. Choice requires retention of options considered and protention toward outcomes anticipated. The [[phenomenology-of-temporal-agency|phenomenology of deliberation]]—holding possibilities open, then narrowing to decision—presupposes temporal structure. If consciousness merely observed predetermined outcomes, the temporal dynamics of choosing would be inexplicable.

**[[tenets#^no-many-worlds|No Many Worlds]]**: The experience of succession—possibilities narrowing to actualities—assumes real collapse. In many-worlds, all possibilities are realized; we merely discover which branch we're on. But temporal experience doesn't feel like discovery; it feels like creation. The qualitative difference between open future and fixed past makes sense under collapse realism, not under eternal branching.

**[[tenets#^occams-limits|Occam's Razor Has Limits]]**: The richness of temporal phenomenology—the specious present, durée, retention-protention, the missing link problem—resists simplification. Illusionists who dismiss temporal flow as mere representation achieve parsimony by ignoring what requires explanation. The complexity of adequate theory may reflect reality's structure.
